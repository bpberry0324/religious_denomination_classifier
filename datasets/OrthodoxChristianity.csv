why seems some piece of art/culture divine and other not,Nagrite,1626803685,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of something for a very long time and never really find the answer myself. I would like to share this to you. I was asking myself why some things like movie and books can provide a feelings really godly whereas other not. And I'm absolutely not speaking about the message behind the book or film but really about a feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main obvious exemple of this is the world of the middle-earth, whatever the product is, movie, books, card game, etc... I feel always like if there is something of the original revelation inside. the same can be said for Narnia, the two have very religious author, but on the other hand, sometimes the same could be said about other works. I always felt that the world of Harry Potter make me feel something like that, and I'm not the only one to tell it. On the other hand, some works that could seems more linked to religion than HP do not make this feeling. Like for exemple Star Wars, that I love as a universe. at first sight it's basicaly a story about monk which have a kind of holy spirit plus some magical power, and a lot of their discipline and of their teaching wouldn't be rejected by the father of the desert I guess (I said a lot, not all surely). But still I feel the world of Star wars extremely, ungodly. You could say it's because SW never speak about religion but actually LOTR movies never speak about religion, only in the Silmarillion, or in the books can you have more informations about it, so I think it's not something so Obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

More surprisingly I feel that for a lot of anime and manga too, particulary some shonen. Whereas they are absolutely not christian. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking myself the same thing about some TTRPG that I practice, why some univers reflect more a feeling of godliness than others. for those who know I found that Vampire the Dark ages make me feel this kind of atmosphere too, so yes they have a big christian background, but the theme stay very grim. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could write about a lot of other books and movies and series, but my point is more to have your opinion. I don't expect that we find a solution, but would be interesting to read your opinion on the matter.",OrthodoxChristianity

"Former Protestant, Future Orthodox: My BF and I plan to marry...",kate_cook94,1626701872,"Hi! 

So I have a question for those of you who have experienced being from a Protestant family but embarking into the Orthodox faith. 

My BF and I have started this journey together. The orthodox faith was never exposed to me, and I had no idea it existed before this past year. I have been on a journey of faith where I wasn't sure where I wanted to go. I grew up Baptist, but I never felt that it was right or that I even knew the truth. I was taught discernment and learning who God is on my own. The cliche individualist Protestant approach to faith in God. 

Learning about Orthodox has changed EVERYTHING. I know that this is the true church. This is the worship that God intended. And I am so excited about it! My BF had been looking into the Orthodox church for awhile before we were even dating, but when it became apparent that he and I were really serious, he told me right away that he had to marry someone on the same path he was. Here we are 9 months into being together, and we keep getting closer and closer as we share our journey in this together. 

My question here is this: how do you handle non-Orthodox family reacting to your choice to have an orthodox wedding? What is your experience in this? I love my family, and I want them to be a part of this, but coming from a fundementalist background, the Orthodox faith initially terrified my family (the assumed it was a cult and heretical).",OrthodoxChristianity

I want to have faith but these arguments kill my faith.,--Froals--,1626636794,"

2) Jesus taught forgiveness but in the Old Testament I see very strict rules that seem like a total different religion. Why God had 2 convenants and not just 1? It really makes me think that they are 2 different false, man-made religions

3) Seemingly Bible contradictions




4) God's plan: Why God wants us to follow Him by trusting the claims of people from many years ago? He knows that many people will be suspicious. People are getting manipulated easily. So, the difference between the two convenants, the seemingly at least bible contradictions will make people not to have faith.

Questions for Catholic converts,bellku,1626525440,"1).  What did your family or friends think?  Were they scandalized or concerned about your choice?  How did you handle that?

2).  Catholicism, at least according to the letter of the law, like Orthodoxy, teaches that if you leave the [Catholic] Church, you will lose your eternal salvation by incurring the damnable sin of schism.  How did you shed that fear in your conversion?

Question about divine liturgy attendance in the Orthodox Church.,CountOfLoon,1626523842,"Hello. Thank you for taking the time to read this post.

I have been orthocurious for quite a while, but it has mainly been a ""self-study"" type of situation, where I read books on the Orthodox Church, read about Orthodox practices (such as prayer, meaning behind the liturgy) and of course pray and read scripture. The only reason I have yet to reach out to my local Orthodox Church is due to crippling social anxiety, but that is my cross to bear and I don't expect any kind of advise on that part. But that is the reason why i'm making this post instead of following the age old advice to talk to a priest ;)  


My question is this one: At this moment I simply cannot promise anybody that I will be able to attend a divine liturgy every single sunday. The reasons behind this are difficult to explain, some are out of my direct control, others are not. One example would be the fact that I often practice a hobby alongside a group of people that I love dearly and enjoy seeing. The sad thing is that, on a sunday, the timetable of the church and this hobby completely overlap. 

So as far as I can see these are my two options: Either stop doing that hobby with my dear friends and go to liturgy alone, or never go to a divine liturgy on sunday. 

Is that correct or is my view of sunday attendance too ""roman"", as in:   
\&gt;if you don't go to church every single sunday you are going to hell because that is a mortal sin

I suppose my question is what the Orthodox position on this is, would attending a weekday liturgy at the Orthodox Cathedral (which is further away from my local church and is probably also done in Greek, which I do not understand fully) be a valid ""substitute"" for missing the occasional sunday liturgy, or am I going to have to read Matthew 6:21 again and decide where I want my heart to be :/",OrthodoxChristianity

Is there an established Eastern Orthodox canon?,yaa32,1626480886,"Part of my study of Orthodoxy and Catholicism has been into the books of the Bible they recognize. The history of this process, other than the definition of the New Testament canon, is extremely hard to find information on. Most sources give heavily biased explanations of why groups they disagree with recognize different books.

One of the most surprising things I've read recently is that there is no established canon for the books of the Bible in Orthodoxy, and that the Greek Orthodox Church doesn't recognize the book of Revelation. The Orthodox Church in America [seems to claim on its website](https://www.oca.org/questions/scripture/canon-of-scripture) that their canon is the same as the Roman Catholic canon, while the Greek Orthodox Church [says its canon hasn't been codified](https://www.goarch.org/-/the-canonical-tradition-of-the-orthodox-church).

The persecution of the Orthodox Church and Christians in the Soviet Union is a history that everyone should study because of lessons it involves.,Anglicanpolitics123,1626477236,"What happened to the Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union due to the Soviets anti religious campaigns is a historical lesson that everyone can learn from in the same way we learn from other atrocities like the African Slave trade, Holocaust or the Armenian genocide. What you see in this particular form of oppression is this.

**(i)It was genocide at many levels. Including the 30s.**

* It is estimated during the period of Joseph Stalin that up to 100,000 priests were executed, especially during the Second 5 year plan and up to 20 million Orthodox Christians were put to death. So this was definitely a genocidal campaign.
* Before in the Russian civil war you also had mass execution of priests and religious believers as well, though not to the same level but with very gruesome details. In 1918 for instance there was a case where priest who tried to stop the execution of a peasant was beaten and cut to pieces by a sword. A priest who was sentence to death in another instance was about to make the sign of the cross. So they chopped off his hand and then sentenced him to death by firing squad. In another instance in the diocese of Perm you had a priest who was arrested and the Cheka(Soviet secret police) cut out his cheeks and eye balls and then paraded him through the streets before burying him alive. In other instances they would drown priests and nuns in holes of ice in lakes during the winter or force them to take communion with melted lead so they would suffocate while taking the sacrament.

**(ii)It started in stages. All involving ""rational"" explanations for the public**

* First the Soviets said that they simply wanted to separate Church and State. Afterwards the Soviets said that they wanted to simply end what they say as the Church's ""privileges.
* The Soviets then when they were faced with a famine in the 20s during the Russian Civil War. What they said was that the Church was doing nothing for famine relief and that instead it was hoarding all this property and gold. That was of course false. The Orthodox Metropolitan of Petrograd Benjamin had a reputation of helping the poor and orphans. He reached an agreement when it came to the sale of property and certain supplies for famine relief with the Petrograd authorities but the Soviet authorities rejected the deal. They sought to seize all of the Church's property. When the priests resisted Lenin signed a decree that had 14,000 of them executed. Benjamin of Petrograd who ironically enough had a reputation for helping the poor. He put on a show trial and then executed by firing squad.

**(iii)It involved a systematic culture war**

* The Soviet Union's culture war against the Church took on many forms. One was the destruction and shutting down of Churches. The most famous being the Cathedral in Moscow in the 30s. Under Khruschev the Soviets initiated a new campaign to end Churches in 1959 with the number of Churches being reduced from 22,000 to 7,000.
* Accompanying this was a systematic campaign of demonisation in the public and education system. The communist party had what was called the ""League of militant Godless"" who's aim was to thoroughly demonise the Church in the public square through a propaganda campaign aimed to turn the populace against priests so they could be arrested and sent to the Gulags. Scholars have compared the demonisation program under Stalin in the 30s to Hitler's demonisation program against the Jews. They tried other methods such as in the 1970s under Brezhnev when the textbooks in schools and universities explicitly mentioned the need to promote ""scientific materialism"" and ""scientific atheism"" and the fact that the Church has to be condemned because it was the ""opiate of the masses"" that was an enemy of the progress they were making in society. One tactic was to accuse priests of either being spies working for the West, the Germans or the Japanese. Another was to accuse the priests of sexual indiscretions and use that as an excuse to send them to the Siberian Gulags.

**(iv)The Soviet authorities infiltrated the Church through Renovationists who sought to ""modernise"" the Church**

* There were a group of priests that were called the ""Red priests"". Another name is the ""Renovationists"". The Soviet authorities forced the Orthodox Church to put them into positions of authority. Some of them being secret Soviet agents themselves. What the ""red priests"" argued was that the Church was being ""reactionary"" with its traditional perspective on worship and social life which was at odds with the Communist movement. They said it must adapt to the times by adopting the communist ideology, modernise, and adopt the materialistic perspective on things.
* In reality the Soviets were using the renovationists as an attempt to launch an internal coup inside the Orthodox Church so they could take it over, with this happening when the Patriarch Tikhon was desposed and then placed under house arrest. Many also said that those who chose to adhere to the traditional Orthodox Christian beliefs were engaged in heresy because they refused to adopt the Soviet modernised doctrines. Eventually ironically enough some of the renovationists themselves were arrested and sent to the Gulag because the Soviets were just using them as a means to an end.
* During the second phase, especially in the 60s and 70s the Soviet Union again had effectively infiltrated the Orthodox Church through the KGB which tried to get the Church to abandon its traditional ""resistance"" to socialism and see socialism as the way to go.

**(v)The Soviets justified what they were doing in the name of ""justice"" and ""progress"".**

* They said that the Church was a reactionary institution that was involved in historic injustices in the past during Tsarist times. Because of this they were justified in doing whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted to ""correct"" those injustices. The destruction of Churches was justified because Churches historically had places of privilege in society. Seizing Church property was justified because it was to ""help the poor"".
* The irony of this is that, especially in the 30s, the people who most resisted these moves happened to be people who were apart of the classes considered to be historically oppressed. Peasants and women. They were the most likely to be opposed to these moves and resisted them especially during Stalin's First Five Year Plan. They denounced the Soviet authorities as being no different from the Anti Christ from their perspective. This was of course missed because many of the Communist authorities were typically a part of the Intelligensia. So even though they talked about the poor, some were out of touch with how the poor or peasants actually felt. Including their religious sensibilities. Others like Nikolai Bukharin were more in tool which is why he advised against a campaign of physical destruction of Churches",OrthodoxChristianity

Why can't you become Orthodox overnight?,actuallylinkstrummer,1626474858,"So I'm a current Protestant really looking into converting to Eastern Orthodoxy, have for a few months now. But within the past few days, I've been starting to doubt.

Struggling with Suffering,epcot32,1626380213,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôd appreciate thoughts on a matter testing my faith. It concerns suffering - not mine, but my wife‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs.

This poor lady has experienced multiple miscarriages and tremendous trouble conceiving. She thankfully had one child about five years ago, and she recently became pregnant with another. However, during the second trimester, her ultrasounds began revealing issues that led her doctors to forecast a minuscule likelihood of safe birth and a high likelihood of permanent disabilities in the event of a safe birth. The doctors actually recommended an abortion, but fortunately she decided against that.

Throughout her ordeal, my wife and I prayed for a safe, healthy birth if it accorded with God‚Äôs will. We prayed daily at home and weekly at Mass (I‚Äôm actually Catholic, but I wanted to seek the counsel of this community, as well). For a period of time, her conditions actually improved at a rate that surprised her doctors, granting us palpable hope. However, a couple weeks ago, she ended up miscarrying.

This brings me to my crisis of faith. Why would an all-good, all-loving, all-powerful God allow this poor woman to suffer so much pain and anguish? I‚Äôve considered the possibility her ordeal brings about the ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù of reminding her and others to fully appreciate the children they *do* have.

Advice request on switching parishes due to family history and avoiding conflict,bigcisco00,1626352292,"I apologize for the length of this post and I'll leave a TLDR at the bottom. I'm (20f) seeking advice as to whether or not I should go to a different parish or stay in the one that I grew up in. I have consulted both my former parish priest and my current parish priest, and while they understand my concerns, they have both expressed that they don't think I'd relate to many people at the only other Orthodox church in my area.

I decided to return to the faith back around March, but had a lot of concerns about returning. It's the church my family has always attended, and the majority of the people there watched me grow up and knew my parents very well as they were very active in the choir, parish council, Sunday school, etc.

My parents rarely attend now. See, I had a very abusive and toxic childhood. My parents put their best face on at Church, but behind closed doors was a very different story. I left home as soon as I turned 18 due to the physical, verbal and emotional abuse I had experienced on a daily basis for my entire life. I have not had any willful contact with them in nearly 2 years.

In the year or so after I moved out, I expressed to my parents numerous times (both calmly and combatively) that until they got their alcoholism and abusive behavior under control I wanted nothing to do with them. I recounted years worth of physical and verbal abuse, years worth of child neglect to them and they vehimatley deny it. They proceeded to stalk me at my job, harass me, show up at my boyfriend's house unannounced (who's parents we lived with at the time,) spread lies about me to family and friends, poison my brother against me, post lies about me on social media, etc. Things were so bad that my older sister (21) moved three states away to start a new life and get away from everything.

I decided to go back to Church to try and find some kind of forgiveness for them in my heart. It's messed up, but I can honestly say in my heart I have no love or forgiveness for them and it's something I've got to find to get right with God and find healing in my heart. I reached out to my former parish priest, who understood where I was coming from. He got me in contact with my current parish priest (who honestly admitted he did not understand where I was coming from but is a very supportive spiritual father.) 

I've gone to confession and gone to church several times since then. It's been hard with my work schedule and the pandemic, but our church has finally fully opened up which is nice.

Since returning, I've had people ambush me to ask me questions about my family, been given very dirty looks by close friends of the family, been ignored by adults I looked up to as a child. I'm not sure that I can continue to go. Now, I leave during the veneration of the cross and beeline to my car to avoid everyone. In a different setting, I think I could handle it, but I feel like church should be the last place to feel that kind of anxiety. I worry it's only a matter of time before my parents show up purely to stalk me and harrass me (they've expressed very clearly they don't want to go anymore because they don't agree with the way our parish handled pandemic guidelines and certain parish council politics.) 

I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb any time I attend. I've considered attending a different church, but I've had two priests advise me to stay at my current parish.

My church is OCA and mostly converts. My family converted when I was 7, so as a kid we fit in pretty well. The other parish within an hour of me is Greek. The services are mostly in Greek and there's hardly any converts. I was advised to stay at my current parish because there'd be more people I could relate to, and I'd be able to understand the services. But I feel like I gave it a pretty good try. I don't want to be constantly anxious or having to defend myself at Church. Unless you've experienced unspeakable abuse from family and cut them off because of it, most people don't understand why and assume you're a horrible person because of it, something I've dealt with a lot. 

So, should I stay at my current parish or give the other church a shot?

TL;DR: Left abusive home at 18, decided to return to church despite my parents having been very active members in the church. Met with unwelcomness from many people due to my parents spreading lies about me and making it known I cut them off. Priest advised me to stay and give it a shot, but I'm thinking about leaving the parish because my parents have a history of stalking and harrassing me and I'm sick of defending myself to everyone I talk to.",OrthodoxChristianity

Extreme doubt about joining the church even if I think it's the most consistent religion.,csrclpz,1626305307,"So, I'm having a crisis to say the least, I used to be an atheist, baptized catholic but with non-practicing parents, the following is relevant to my question not just fluff, also please forgive me if I ramble too much or don't have a clear train of thought, I'm just in a lot of distress about this, and I even have more details but, I don't want to overwhelm or be too open for comfort:

 I used to be really reserved and had a bad relationship with my dad, the two are correlated since my dad used to pretty much bully me to make fun of me or got extremely impatient with me since I was a kid, including saying to my face that he was disappointed in me and worse. 
In middle school I had a group of friends who took me out of my shell and I discovered I loved their brand of crass humor and found it very liberating, and also, since I was a kid I did artwork and now I'm on my way to make money from my skills.

This is relevant because some years ago, a lot of life tragedies came up and that all led me to look for God, and I discovered Orthodoxy which to me seemed the most consistent out of all christian denominations, but, my impression was that of a religion that allthough, of course, needs a solid foundation, it still gave leeway to people depending on their practical circumstances, such as diet needs in the face of fasting tradition etc.

However...even though I have a circle of orthodox friends, I am not officially one myself, and I just don't get along with them as well as with my childhood friends, and they all have conflicting views on what's right and wrong, very trigger happy, inconsistent, for example, if I'm being humorous they will all laugh and give me the impression wit their own jokes that x thing is okay, but then suddently I'll say something without evil in my heart about maybe a funny thought about an aspect of the religion, and it's just all indignation, and I mention this first because of course, humor always has a line, and I understand that, but there's also weird assumptions that I can will things like love without them people doing their part, especially in the case of parents (short story, i do not hate my parents, but my dad and I did not produce a good relationship, and I always tried my best to obey him and be a nice person until his dying breath, but there's thing about his behavior torwards me that right now I can't forgive, and I'm ok with that, he himself had a mental illness, anxiety (and I developed it too, along with OCD which was more pronounced as a child), due to his conflict with his abusive dad, my grandfather, a conflict of obeying him vs not wanting to be around him due to his adultery and violent ways, it tore him apart mentally, I don't care how many canons there are to forgive parents at the cost of your mental stability, but I cannot accept such a thing). 

Some of them have a , in my view, strange standard of asceticism such as hating sex and hating life in general and they just want to talk about church all day.

Additionally, I do not desire children at ALL, none, but I do want a wife, and I think there are many examples of couples without children that are not bad people, I always try and give selflessly to those in need, if i have the ability to, because I hate ""tit for tat"" when for example, giving someone money, I say this because I see people saying that children take away selfishness, but I don't think that's necessary, some parents have kids and completely ignore them. Of course the question comes, if I want to have a companion in my wife, but not children, well then ovbiously preventative measures must be taken. 

Finally, I love art, and while I do have a line in the sand where I will not draw, because I really have no desire to, pornography as in depictions of sex, I do draw women and men like greek nudes, and women soemtimes in a ""sexy"" way, like this comic book artists called Adam Hughes, but again, when I do this, I just enjoy drawing the shapes, textures, etc, it doesn't devolve into a private timewaster of a sexual nature.

So, I mean, I should probably go to a church and ask a priest, but while things can change, I may want children after all..I may like drawing icons and be instructed into that in the future, I can't tell, and for now those things are not in the menu, nor is me being compeltely unquestioning of saints or heirarchy if I disagree, especially for biased thoughts of monks on human sexuality and such, while I'm not about just annoying people with my questioning, if something pops up that doesn't make sense to me, I'm just not going with it, how can I even feel worthy of stepping ona  church when I have so many incompatibilities with it? but at the end...I'm afraid of hell, I'm afraid of what works are, what fiath is, what true fath is, what true love for God is, and I have zero confidence in my ability to save myself and for God to think I'm worthy, but life is not fast, it's long, and my humor, my art, my feelings of romance, my friendships, they're the few things that give me any enjoyment in this life, and it would be nigh impossible for me to just uproot myself and become a stoic soldier. I've prayed to God to maybe reformat me, but as of now, if I have to change all at once, it's just too much to bear, and I come to reddit to see if anyone has the patience to give me even a vague answer, I don't want to claim I am something that I'm not at heart.",OrthodoxChristianity

Question about Orthodox understanding of sin,chanson-florale,1626286257,"I‚Äôve been exploring Orthodox theology for a while now after being introduced to it by a friend that somewhat-recently converted from Protestantism. I‚Äôm a Protestant, myself, and though I don‚Äôt as of now feel convinced that I should convert to Orthodoxy, I do find your theology really interesting and the things I‚Äôve been learning have definitely been contributing to my spiritual growth. With all of that being said, one thing I‚Äôm not quite understanding is how you guys view sin. I understand that you view sin as a sort of sickness, or disease that has infected humanity and our world, that part makes sense to me. What I don‚Äôt understand, however, is this:
It seems to me that the Orthodox view does not take sin as seriously as the Protestant tradition I come from does. I don‚Äôt see the same concept of an unimaginably holy God, or the true lowliness that is sin. I don‚Äôt see any concept that our sins anger and offend God. But the Scriptures show us a God who is indeed angry at sin, who sees it as a personal offense, and who does indeed have wrath stored up against sinful humanity. I don‚Äôt think this in any way diminishes, let alone replaces, the wonderful richness of God‚Äôs grace, mercy and loving-kindness. In fact, I personally would reason that if God is truly good, of COURSE he hates sin. And of COURSE he wants to destroy it. And of COURSE he wants to free us from it.
In addition to this, I don‚Äôt quite understand why you would do something like pray to saints or go to a priest to receive absolution when we have been given the Holy Spirit and we are explicitly told that we can approach the throne of God with boldness and confidence. Not that we shouldn‚Äôt practice confession or pray with our brothers and sisters. I just don‚Äôt see why that is your first instinct rather than to approach God personally?

"Theosis is infinite, a never ending process of purification and deification? Sounds terrifying to me.",christian47473,1626272622,"First let me state I‚Äôm new to orthodoxy and I‚Äôm looking to get baptized so forgive me. 

I‚Äôll start off by saying I was reading the other day and read that theosis is infinite a never ending process of purification. I understand basic concepts of theosis and I understand our soul is in a state of sickness with sin. 
And I do understand why this process is infinite because god is and we can always become better. But what truly scares me is that it is a never-ending process of purification. It almost sounds hell-like. I understand we can never fully understand god or the logos. But we can get closer to them. But I‚Äôm truly terrified if theosis is infinite it sounds like we will always need more and more. It almost feels like we are ‚Äúwalking‚Äù towards the light but will never reach it (even if you experience the uncreated light). I compare it in my mind almost to reaching after something and never actually getting there but getting closer and closer for eternity, which sounds terrifying and hell-like. I just don‚Äôt understand, is there ever an end point? I‚Äôm scared we will never truly feel whole again and that we will always be chasing it but never reach it. 
(This is why I was turned off from eastern philosophies such as Buddhism because ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù or ‚Äúawakening‚Äù was always awakening to more and it was a never ending process which sounds terrible to me.) (I‚Äôm not claiming these philosophies are anything like orthodoxy or that claim about them is what they truly believe but that‚Äôs just how I was lead out of them and into orthodoxy) I just want to feel whole again but it feels like we will never actually get there and just spend eternity chasing it. Feels like we will never be able to relax. In the book ‚Äúst Gregory plasmas as a hagiorite‚Äù he says standing still is essentially ‚Äúfalling‚Äù. This sounds like we can never relax. And it sounds like a terrifying eternal torture to chase something but to never FULLY reach it. 

I will be talking to my local priest when I move back for school in a few months but currently my hometown is hours and hours from an Orthodox Church. 

I would love some help or clarification if anyone can. I would really appreciate it.

Why does the dark seem more accessible then the light?,JadedDig90,1626240865,"Why is it that it seems easier to sense or have experiences with dark, demonic forces through shamanism, drugs etc then it is to experience true beings of good? 
Seems like people are constantly seeing ghosts and paranormal activity which could be attributed to demons, but accounts of people seeing God or true angels are less common. And when people do see what they believe is an angel it is often discredited as being a false entity of light?

I am seeking God and truth but it feels like God is less likely to show up in someones life as an ""experience"" whereas these dark forces seem to be more then happy to show themselves?

I believe Jesus has power and dominion over all but i dont get it? The devil has demons. Does God have his angels and the saints? Is it idolatry to call on them for help?

Does God care about our suffering?,Revolutionary_Zebra1,1626233965,"Hi,

I was raised Reformed Calvinist. My whole family view God as a stickler for rules and that he doesn't care if people suffer or not because he only cares about your soul. Today my brother posted this on Facebook:

""God doesn't care about your suffering in this life. We live this life for God so the next life can be eternal. This means that no amount of suffering or injustice means that God doesn't love you. Our happiness in this life doesn't matter. Nearly all of the original apostles were martyrs, what kind of message is that?

Do Orthodox ever request intercession from departed people who aren't canonized?,GrillOrBeGrilled,1626229256,"I think I read a remark made in passing that an Orthodox orphan would conceivably pray to his deceased parents, even while praying *for* them as well. Honestly, to my tiny Protestant brain, it seems even more natural to ask for the prayers of a beloved relative on the other side than to ask for those of people we've never met. Indeed, I know several Evangelicals who say they talk to loved ones who have passed on, and I have no doubt that those loved ones hear them. Likewise, an Orthodox former colleague (I think he may be a priest now!) told me about someone he knew whose uncle actually *was* glorified, and how he was certain that his acquaintance had already been praying to the relative before his glorification.

Is this correct? If so, are there limitations? I'm sure a notoriously wicked relative we'd want to spend more time praying *for,* but how far ""off the books"" is it considered appropriate to go?",OrthodoxChristianity

Guilt Question,laststrawbraw4,1626208210," 

&gt;If its too long don‚Äôt read .Ok this is so lame and desparate sounding. but I have some questions which I don‚Äôt want to keep asking or to be thinking and wondering when I start to get better with my ocd. I have two Questions. Anyone who can give a good answer thanks. Not just what I want to hear. But the truth. Because I‚Äôm not planning on asking these questions ever again. And I want to know the real consequences of this sin. Its really important since it was singled out and I really want sound bible advice on this sin and the punishments if you know it . First on the blasphemy of The Holy Ghost. I did it like 5 months ago out of bitterness for my life.  
&gt;  
&gt;And as paul in the bible said that because many were bitter many be came defiled I think that‚Äôs what he said. So when I realized I was angry at my life and was trying to do better. And I wasn‚Äôt done with some habits I tried to promise God TO quit. I still had no real joy in my life and I promised to give up things I loved. Like certain music and foods. Also I wasn‚Äôt very nice. Because I loved my family. But they like other things because of their judgements and the things they say to me, I tried to protect myself. So it could have both been bitterness and like ptsd and trying to avoid them and being tough and walking with a hard look and a stump so they wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable enough to try to speak to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Just to say some messed up useless stuff. which is harder for me to get over. Mainly because I don‚Äôt have any real friends or people who just like me. Only my siblings and parents. I‚Äôve depended on them for a lot and that was where I went wrong. Trying to make them love things about me they just hated, and they basically shuned me. For an example this may be tmi. But just to show some sick stuff my dad has bullied me about. Once I had a pad. For periods. And you know not to flush them.  
&gt;  
&gt;So instead of like my mom she wraps it in the paper and puts it in a bag so it wont leak or anything and so u cant see it in the trash. Now I was feeling bad and didn‚Äôt want to get one. So I got like basically the whole roll of tissue and wraped my pad in it. Now like in the next thirty mintues my dad was wodering where all the tissue went and freaking out. And he decided to look through the trash because he was trying to firgure out why it was all gone. And found a wad of tissue and then when seeing there was a pad init or it was bleeding through and then he like came out and asked if it was me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then I said yeah that‚Äôs mine. He said it was disgusting and that he didn‚Äôt want to see that. And then he grabbed me by the arm and like brang me in their mom and dads room and yelled at me. And like said it was gross and nasty and I looked at my mom and she was like what ever im tired of you, and then he ask what was wrong with my hair and I said my hair is fine. Then he got a mirror and was mockingly like does this look done and laughing. Then he said I‚Äôd be shocked if I saw you in heaven. Over a pad with blood that he went looking for in the trash.  
&gt;  
&gt;Think he went and dug through the trash looking for shit. That‚Äôs like me going and putting my hand in the toliet and finding shit and being shocked what did you expect you was gonna find doing that. So that‚Äôs just a taste of what he does. Trust me I don‚Äôt always complain about every minor inconvenience. Then I don‚Äôt wanna be ew cause God is God and can say what he wants. But I have an older sister she‚Äôs 24 and is kidna fast and she was a teen mom. And I kinda judged her tho I was only jealous of her cause dad loved her so much. Like anytime my sister would come around I‚Äôd love seeing her and my niece.  
&gt;  
&gt;More then all my siblings and mom. She‚Äôs my half sister by the way/ only one who loved seeing her more was my dad. So that being said I still was jealous of her and it totally wasn‚Äôt her fault. Now all this shit was in my head and I was bitter. and I kinda would take it out on my siblings not out loud but in my head. and I was angry at GOD AND MY FAMILY FOR WEEKS BLASPHEMYING AND STUFF BEING RUDE. And I decide to read the bible and then he had like passages for me cuz I blaspheymed and was trying so hard to be good. And then the bible had a passage about the virgins in israel doing a very horrible thing and saying as if it were a little thing they were more defiled then everyone idk.  
&gt;  
&gt;But also it had one about ahloa and her sister and I knew that was for me tho im not a whore. It was like this is the sins of your sister. And my golly that were totally describing my sister being a little fast eatting a lot and being pridful and kinda selfish. But then he said init she is better then you. Like it said your sister is like in all she has done better then you, and for that momment it was like a badly written sitcom. You know like where the sad and depressed one keeps trying to show their good and better.  
&gt;  
&gt;And the other is care free and happy and doesn‚Äôt care as much but some how ends up better then you and that‚Äôs how this is God tried to paint me out to be this evil and envious person which sometimes I am. So that brings me to these questins like in my other post I don‚Äôt like suprises I like to know things so I don‚Äôt have to worry about them. I sont mind being told no im not peter. But thinking your gonna do or get something and then not is like not very good, and I know you guys are so much more wiser then me and read the Bible more and listen so this is the question , this maraggie supper of the lamb is said only blessed are those which are called.  
&gt;  
&gt;And I hate being left out of stuff. Tho my dad says some in heaven wont go, now like saul when he was rejected from being king because of his disobediecne. I just wanted to know since I called the holy ghost evil and also I um publicly tried to slander him in a sneaky way online if you look at my other post you‚Äôll see.. Dose that hurt my chances like is there any bible verse to back this thought of mine up just asking. And that last one is as you all know this see I read something about like in the greek bible translation it was a novum testamentum graece and it said I do always let go the sons of men the sins and the blasphemy as much as it is blasphemyed but he who blasphemys against the Holy Ghost has not let go but is guilty of an eternal sin.

[Our God is all great and cannot be comprehended](https://genius.com/Lebo2196-why-i-hate-religion-but-love-jesus-muslim-version-annotated#note-561081)  
You say that God was murdered, but you believe that he pretended  
See, God gave us brains, and God gave us logic  
But I guess God wanted us to use them in everything else except for this topic  
It's like wearing a cross and proclaiming that you love Jesus  
When if God was murdered on the cross, the cross really shouldn't please us  
I mean would you be wearing an axe if it was used to chop your mother up into pieces?  
See, this is what happens when you believe in faith, but fail to believe in reason

The concept too complex for the church to merely fathom  
But he was the creator of the universe, for all we know even more  
And so what if we can't see him, I mean, what'chu acting like our universe is small  
I mean there's still so much we've still yet to explore  
I mean there's still so many things as human beings we still haven't seen, touched, heard or saw  
I mean our eyes can't even handle the sight of the sun  
So how could we possibly handle the sight of our lord?  
See Jesus used to pray, but in your opinion who'd he pray to?  
I mean, if Jesus was God, surely praying would be of no use  
Or did he only require it when he needed to know the truth  
Like when God wasn't sure whether it was the season of the fruit  
Or maybe he prayed when there was something he couldn't do  
Like when he said, ""I, of myself who can do nothing"", but you took it as, there's nothing he couldn't do  
See no one used to worship Jesus, so ask yourself why do you  
A concept so straightforward, but it's left so many confused  
See Jesus preached one God, but the church has failed to practice  
And I mean you don't need to be that dumb to know that one plus one plus one equaled in one isn't necessarily going to give you a pass in mathematics  
See the church said three, and Jesus said one  
Jesus said God, and the church said son  
Jesus never said, ""Worship me,"" rather he said pray  
But you've chosen to worship Jesus despite everything he used to say  
You began to think with your emotion, and forgot to think with your mind  
I guess you didn't pay attention when Jesus says our father, yet never says mine  
You came to be a follower of Christ, yet you still choose to eat swine  
And you call yourselves Christians, but in your churches you're busy drinking wine  
And just to clarify, I do love Jesus, matter of fact I love him more than you  
Because when Jesus said, ""Do something,"" I actually do  
However, I'm not connected with the church nor with the Bible  
See I love Jesus as my prophet but refuse to worship him as an idol  
Just like he wants it, and proclaimed it as sin  
So it doesn't really matter if they don't let him in  
Because Jesus wouldn't even want to be in his presence of people worshipping an idol of him  


\[News broadcasting clip\]  
An act of God, a bolt of lightning went straight through the outstretched hand of Jesus  
This cannot be a coincidence  


Before I move on, there's something I need to mention  
The worshipping of Jesus is a manmade invention  
He never asked for your worship so he could grant you protection  
Rather he asked you to alternate your prayers towards another direction  
To God and God only, and pray that he accepts them  
And know that just because you love Jesus, doesn't mean he feels the same way about your affection  
See, what you believe in is exactly what he resented, matter of fact it's everything he despised  
See, the worshipping of creation goes against the very message he supplied  
So you began to follow a religion, and called it love in disguise  
Because love can be good, but love can be blind",OrthodoxChristianity

Fear of Hell or Fear of God?,AllisModesty,1626119160,"Orthodoxy has it‚Äôs own set of fundamentalists and extremists, and one thing they like to emphasize is the fear of God, the wrath of God and his tendency to punish and send those who do not repent to the fiery depths of hell.

I struggled a long time with scrupulosity, anxiety and a captivating fear of hell and judgement that kept me away from the Eucharist for fear of drinking to my condemnation should I need to hydrate myself befor my church‚Äôs rather late Liturgy (10:30 am-ish). I would obsess over fasting rules, question whether things I engaged in as a twelve year old were in fact terrible sins, confess the smallest and silliest of things (my priest pointed this out during my confession, even) and just generally act over scrupulous. The one thing it did not do is help me actually repent of the sins that were genuinely on my conscience. It wasted time worrying about little sins and kept me from receiving. Now with Covid I have not received in well over a year.

In short, this attitude was very spiritually harmful for me.

Getting over this attitude and finally understanding Orthodoxy‚Äôs view of faith and works, the sacraments, atonement and soteriology was incredibly liberating. I am not sure this fear of hell is helpful to anyone. It only leads to despondency, a terrible sin in itself. At best, this despondency is temporary. At worst, it can lead one into rampant OCD, depression and even to suicide. In my case, it was thankfully the former. It also leads to liberal theology that seeks to redefine sin or deny the permanence of Hell. Neither of these extremes are spiritually helpful or *true*.

People think Judas‚Äô sin was denying Christ, but there is a reason why Peter - who denied Christ not once, but THRICE - is venerated as one of the greatest saints and Judas is not. Judas was despondent. He did not believe in God‚Äôs mercy. All this fire and brimstone talk seems to reinforce this idea that we are all Judas, not Peter.

So why do I still see posts, comments and articles by people acting as if God is just waiting for you to sin one more time so he can withdraw his mercy form you, or let you die so that he can finally damn you like the filthy rat that you are? I have found numerous posts and stories about teenagers being sent to hell for impure thoughts, for example. The emphasis on this - especially on the internet - seems a little much.

Feeling very lost - looking to Orthodoxy,studyseason,1626111477,"I am currently Roman Catholic, having grown up in an atheist household. I'm feeling very lost in my faith, and I'm just not sure where to turn to. I know the general advice would be to get in contact with your local Orthodox Church - but unfortunately there are very few in easy distance to where I am in Scotland, a lot of them don't have contact information, and they're shut because of Corona restrictions. I am looking into moving to England, so have somewhat reached out to some Churches in the area that I'm looking to get an apartment. But I would appreciate being able to get some advice from various resources.

I grew up mostly agnostic, with a secular (although this was in truth Protestant) schooling that made me want to form a relationship with God. For many years I kind of felt like I missed the boat, I hadn't been baptised and I didn't know how to join a Church or what that even meant. I was struggling with severe depression, and it was after a suicide attempt that I pushed to pursue a Church. I looked into Orthodoxy at the time, but I was really confused and put off by the perceived Ethnic nature of the Church. I'm not Syrian, Russian, Greek or so forth, so I (rightly or wrongly) felt that the Church wasn't for me. That I would be intruding. And on a surface level it conflicted with my idea of God's Church being universal in the sense that anyone could convert to it. If it existed to serve particular groups then it seemed to go against that message. So I didn't look any further into Orthodoxy. I was just too conflicted and confused on the matter, I was also scared about intruding upon a community.

I felt pulled towards Catholicism. I began attending a Catholic Church, and I really did feel like it helped my depression a lot. Although that could be just because going to Church forced some level of self care, and meant that I was regularly getting out of the house (I attended Mass multiple times a week before university started). It was never really a theological argument that brought me to Catholicism. I did believe in the Eucharist, which was something that conflicted with Protestantism ever being an option. My time attending Protestant services at school really felt lacking. I just felt called towards it. That this was where God was taking me.

I ended up in an abusive relationship with someone that hated Christianity, and this really drove a wedge in between myself and the faith. I wrongly thought that I could pray for his conversion, but instead I ended up falling away. I'm now in a position where I want to come back to God. I left that relationship, and now I want to build myself up again. And this has meant looking towards theology as something beyond reading superficial stories of Catholic Saints. Which is where I am now, feeling conflicted.

I had for a long while struggled to reconcile Marian apparitions with Christianity. To a large extent I felt that the argument that the Virgin Mary points us towards her Son makes a lot of sense, but I feel like in reality a lot of people stop at just worshipping her. Some people (including Catholic Saints) dedicate themselves solely towards praying towards her, which feels 'wrong'. In Marian apparitions she is seen as controlling a wrathful and angry Jesus. I don't take argument with holding her in high regard, I certainly don't believe in dismissing her entirely or never asking for her intercession. But I can't wrap my head around only praying towards her, and this idea that Jesus is someone that needs to be held back by His mother.

Another thing that I really struggle with is this notion that purgatory is akin to hellfire. Where Saints who are deigned to go to Heaven are in excruciating pains of Hell, and have to come to Earth and ask for x amount of Masses to be said to them in order to reach Heaven. Hearing stories of Priests saying figures enveloped in Hellfire asked for a Mass to be said for them feels more like a horror movie than Christianity. I don't actually know anything about the Orthodox conception of purgatory, but I do know that I'm left feeling that this conception of Purgatory as Hellfire is wrong in some way. Although I do appreciate that I'm not particularly knowledgeable or skilled in theological matters - I'm very open to being wrong on this.

The Filioque clause is an obvious one, I'm currently reading '[Saint Photius the Great - The Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit](http://www.myriobiblos.gr/texts/english/photios_mystagogy.html)' which is raising a lot of arguments that I am inclined to agree with. I've also read an article comparing Francis of Assisi and St. Seraphim of Sarov (sorry I can't link it because of rules, but I felt important to mention) and agree with some of the points put forth about the distinction in humility of Orthodox and Catholic Saints and criticism of Catholic Mysticism.

But I'm still left feeling very lost. I don't know anyone that's Orthodox. I haven't seen any Orthodox person living their faith. I still struggle with mental health issues, recently being diagnosed with OCD. I'm a chronic overthinker that also tries to cling to certainty, and I feel very overwhelmed because there's so much that I'm uncertain about. I don't really understand 'Russian Orthodox' 'Greek Orthodox' 'Syrian Orthodox' and so on. I don't know anything about Orthodoxy asides from the few things I've put forward. In some ways I do still feel like I'm intruding upon a space that wasn't meant for me. But I can't just dismiss the things that I'm feeling inclined to agree with. Whether I'm wrong in need of correction to remain in line with Catholicism, or to move towards Orthodoxy. I do feel like I'm betraying God and the Saints and I don't want to do that. I feel guilty even writing this and having these thoughts. I'm just left feeling very lost and I'm not sure where to go from here.

Does anyone have any advice? Any recommendations of books or other resources to check out? How does the Orthodox Church function? What does Russian/Greek/Syriac/etc Orthodox actually mean? For any people here that converted from Catholicism, what resources did you find particularly useful? What arguments drove you towards Orthodoxy?

Orthodox View on Pets and Animals,Sedentary_Longjumper,1626100355,"I recently learned that Orthodoxy teaches animals have their own souls separate from the human type of soul. Coming from a protestant background I was surprised by this, since I was previously told animals do not have souls. This raised a lot of questions in my mind. Are animals in heaven? What happens to their soul when they die? Will animals be with christians on the New Earth after Jesus's second coming? What is the purpose of animals on earth? Why did God create animals? 

I've always loved animals my whole life and found them beautiful. I know loving an animal above a human is wrong and I have never felt that I would choose my pets over another human life. But they have always brought me joy and earthly comfort and I always thank the Lord for them in my prayers, and for all of His beautiful creation. I find that the beauty of an animal's being and creation gives me an appreciation for the beauty and power of Gods grace and mercy. Is it wrong for me to have these feelings?",OrthodoxChristianity

There seems to be little tension between what the apparitions have purportedly said and his own Orthodox faith.

Went to an orthodox church for the first time in my life today...,jamieh800,1626062721,"And I'd like to discuss my experience. 

First, talk about culture shock. I knew it'd be different than the protestant churches I went to as a child, but wow. From the moment I walked in to the end of the Liturgy, it was just an almost alien experience. But in a good way. The icons all over the walls and everywhere really made the stain glass windows of other churches seem woefully inadequate.  The service itself was beautiful. My girlfriend, who came with me, actually began to tear up in the middle of it. I got emotional too. But there were MANY times where I felt like a fish out of water. I knew exactly one prayer that everyone recited, and felt I could follow along: the Lord's Prayer. I had no idea when to cross myself, or if there were even specific times I was supposed to. I was under dressed (jeans and a t shirt constitute the nicest clothes I own). However i never truly felt out of place, if that makes sense. 

Second, the people. They were probably some of the kindest, most welcoming people I've ever met in my entire life. For some reason, I had this mental image of Orthodox Christians being a very closed group, but it was nothing like that at all. The two elderly ladies in front of us introduced us to the priest, who was himself incredibly welcoming. And not at all stern or whatever that I was expecting. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to speak much with the priest as he had two baptisms to perform, but what little interaction I had dispelled most of my fears. 

Third, the service itself was absolutely beautiful, as I said, but the gospel reading just happened to be a verse from Matthew that my girlfriend and I very recently read together. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but if that's not a subtle sign from God telling me ""you're in the right place"", I honestly have no idea what is. Also, I felt this strange sense of calm throughout the rest of the day. Even through my shift at work, I barely felt stressed.

Church Fathers supporting Sola scriptura????,actuallylinkstrummer,1626058554,"This is keeping me up at night, I can‚Äôt sleep.

But I‚Äôm having doubts and I need help. 

I stumbled upon a Reddit thread earlier today either on r/TrueChristian or r/Reformed. And there was some undeniable proof that the early church fathers supported the Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura. I worried that they may have lied or edited the words of the church fathers, so I decided to research their writings myself. And this is what I found:

**Hippolytus - *Against Heresies* (325AD)

*There is, brethren, one God, the knowledge of whom we gain from the Holy Scriptures, and from no other source. For just as a man if he wishes to be skilled in the wisdom of this world will find himself unable to get at it in any other way than by mastering the dogmas of philosophers, so all of us who wish to practice piety will be unable to learn its practice from any quarter than the oracles of God. Whatever things then the Holy Scriptures declare, at these let us look; and whatsoever things they teach these let us learn.* 

**Gregory of Nyssa - *Dogmatic Treatises, Book 12. On the Trinity, To Eustathius.* **

*‚ÄùLet the inspired Scripture, then, be our umpire, and the vote of truth will surely be given to those whose dogmas are found to agree with the Divine words.‚Äù*

**Iraneus of Lyons (175)**

*‚ÄùWe have learned from none others the plan of our salvation, than from those through whom the gospel has come down to us, which they did at one time proclaim in public, and, at a later period, by the will of God, handed down to us in the Scriptures, to be the ground and pillar of our faith.""*

*‚ÄùThey [heretics] gather their views from other sources than the Scriptures. We have learned from none others the plan of our salvation, than from those through whom the Gospel has come down to us, which they did at one time proclaim in public, and, at a later period, by the will of God, handed down to us in the Scriptures, to be the ground and pillar of our faith.‚Äù* 

**Ambrose - *Duties of the Clergy* (330-397)**

*‚ÄùFor how can we adopt those things which we do not find in the holy Scriptures?‚Äù*

"I wish to ask you something. I felt a bit off the mood today and prayed, but I also noted my prayer down. Whatever do you think about it?",FromDayOn,1626035932,"Lord,

why all of this?; why always trials after trials?

I know that you want me drawn to you

Closer as possible

I know that life on earth is full tribulations,

But if you know that in my heart I feel pain

Where are you to comfort me, thy peace I miss

Even the psalms say: ‚ÄúThe Lord is my refuge.‚Äù

Lord, love is kind, but it also can destroy you

I know that you want to protect me from evil

But what pain is bigger, from evil or the pain of loneliness

Wasn‚Äôt man supposed to join his wife later in life

Many people I know, Lord

They found the their other half, yet you keep me lonely,

They say they are Christians, but do not even try to do Your will

I myself was born a sinner into this world, but you chose me

You said to me: ‚ÄúMy child, you are my treasure, priceless, sacred, worthy, loved, not alone;

Why then do you keep me lonely; my Shepherd

I hear your voice and I follow you

You give me eternal life, so that I may never die

I know that Thy time and will are not my also;

For it is written: ‚ÄúI the Lord will make it happen at the right time,

Why do I feel like you want me lonely all my life; is it the devil whispering this into my ear?

Many are your ways Lord; look at me, I go into a quiet place and with love into my heart I read your Word Lord,

I watch the heavens, that show your glory; yet they cannot contain it,

What is my purpose in life Lord?

Why did you create me, for You were with me all my life until now,

When I was 12 you chose me to believe in you,

Blessed be you Lord, for I saw in the mirror my face weeping similar to a spring of water,

For even you know what weeping is Lord; when Martha and Marry were brokenhearted,

I know that you felt my heart, and forgive me if I hurt too much with my sorrow,

But I wish to find the one, the one who will come from you,

But why do I have to wait so much; what is Your will?

You know that even if you fill my heart with your love; I still desire the one of a woman as well,

Is the world so fallen in darkness o Lord; that there is no one for me?

For even the prophets born in Judea and all over Israel had a wife and children,

I see you don‚Äôt want me to become a preacher; for it is not given unto everybody,

But do you also not want me to enjoy my life with beautiful woman who also is godly?

What life is such as this I tell about Lord; for you make me worried,

I don‚Äô wish to gain the whole World Lord,

I want to have my family, my wife and my children,

Now I am 22 Lord, I wish to enjoy my youthfulness  

With a woman who would come from you

Forgive if my words are full of sin; but I know you care for me,

Just tell me one thing Lord; when shall it come to pass,

I don‚Äôt want my life to be sad, but enjoyed in a union with a woman from you,

For it is written:‚Äù What God has joint together, no man can destroy,

I love you my Lord Jesus Christ,; for you also said,  

You are my friends if you abide me and I in you,

You are my best friend Jesus; the only one in the world whom I can trust,

And I ask you in your name; when and where will I meet the one Lord, I wait for your sign.  

Amen",OrthodoxChristianity

why there are different descriptions of events about the empty tomb?,--Moser--,1625906832,"Luke:

24 On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. 2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 3 but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4 While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. 5 In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, ‚ÄúWhy do you look for the living among the dead? 6 He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 7 ‚ÄòThe Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.‚Äô ‚Äù 8 Then they remembered his words.

John:

20 Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. 2 So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, ‚ÄúThey have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don‚Äôt know where they have put him!‚Äù

3 So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb. 4 Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 5 He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in. 6 Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, 7 as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus‚Äô head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen. 8 Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. 9 (They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.) 10 Then the disciples went back to where they were staying. Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene

11 Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb 12 and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus‚Äô body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.

13 They asked her, ‚ÄúWoman, why are you crying?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey have taken my Lord away,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand I don‚Äôt know where they have put him.‚Äù 14 At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.

15 He asked her, ‚ÄúWoman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?‚Äù

Thinking he was the gardener, she said, ‚ÄúSir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.‚Äù

16 Jesus said to her, ‚ÄúMary.‚Äù

She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, ‚ÄúRabboni!‚Äù (which means ‚ÄúTeacher‚Äù).

17 Jesus said, ‚ÄúDo not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‚ÄòI am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.‚Äô‚Äù

18 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: ‚ÄúI have seen the Lord!‚Äù And she told them that he had said these things to her.

Matthew:

28 After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.

2 There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. 4 The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

5 The angel said to the women, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‚ÄòHe has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.‚Äô Now I have told you.‚Äù

8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them. ‚ÄúGreetings,‚Äù he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.‚Äù

Mark:

16 When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus‚Äô body. 2 Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb 3 and they asked each other, ‚ÄúWho will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?‚Äù

4 But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. 5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.

6 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be alarmed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‚ÄòHe is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.‚Äô‚Äù

"after ""Metropolitan Hilarion Urge Faithful to Get Vaccinated""",Asleep-Search,1625828501,"The second reason for the mass God-fighting in Russia after the revolution was the merger of the Church as an organization with the state power, serving the interests of the oppressor class. Unfortunately, our hierarchs did not draw conclusions, and now the situation is repeating itself. The issue of covid is a political issue, not a medical one, it was clear from the very beginning (only the scale was unexpected - it seemed that it would be another bird flu or mad cow disease). And - I can't say, the majority or the minority, but many - representatives of our clergy turned out to be loyal and overly loyal to the secular authorities, trying to justify and impose the muddy and false initiatives of the government with the authority of the Church and religious rhetoric, and adding their own. Even now, some of the representatives of the Church, including prominent hierarchs, were not with the people. In Russia, in connection with the covid, events are downright apocalyptic: they openly talk about banning unvaccinated people from working, moving around in public transport, visiting various public places. Despite this and the frenzied propaganda, the number of vaccinated people is in the region of 10-15% (according to the latest official data known to me). The people/nation are against vaccination. Therefore - perhaps not tomorrow, but sooner or later - they will come for us again.

Can someone be a Christian without following the church?,--Moser--,1625825440,"In my country's orthodox, it is believed that we must fast Wednesdays and Fridays, attend Church every Sunday. And confess our sins to a priest (sacrament of confession).

There are some things in orthodoxy that I just dont disagree. For example, a monk told me that it is a sin for a woman to wear pants.

He told me that I must give 1/10 of my montlhy money to poor people. (do not remember if he said that I can give them directly to poor or if I need them to give them to church first)

An orthodox Christian told me that there are rules in orhtodoxy that we must follow. He said that people will end up in hell for not participating in reading of devotional hymns.

He said that suicders go to hell.

and that we must find strict monks to guide us. We must allow the monks (spiritual fathers) to insult us. He even said that we must do what they say, and if they order to commit suicide we must do it.

He even said a story in which someone tried to commit suicide because the monk told him to (because of his sin/sins). The person was ready to do it but the monk canceled the request but the sinner was congratulated about his obedience.

He claims that these words are not his but from the fathers of the church. A homosexual man wrote about his concerns regarding his sexual urges and that man started telling him that he must be humbled and live a life as a monk will tell him.

He said that orthodoxy many years ago, believe that a woman has no soul and that orthodoxy is people who make mistakes but it is the right life for a Christian to live.

1) First of all, the man contradicts himself when he sais that suiciders go to hell and that the man must commit a suicide if the monk orders him.

2) So, if someone tries to be a very good Christian but for some reason does not participate in reading of the devotional hymns, will God send him to hell?

Attending an Orthodox Cathedral,DavidHopkins-Brooke,1625804679,"I've been reading more and more about Christianity and Orthodoxy and I've decided to take the next step and attend an Orthodox Church on Sunday. I've read many of the guides and reddit posts on how to attend (standing, priest facing away etc.) but three potential problems that keep coming up are that 1) Orthodox services flow into each other, 2) that Orthodox priests often start very early or very late (so not at the expected time) and 3) a large part of the service may be in Greek and the Cathedral nearby doesn't make the language setup explicit.

Although I feel I'm being led towards Orthodoxy it could go very wrong if I turn up at the wrong time, don't know when to leave, don't understand the language, don't know what service is happening because the schedule is off and don't know what I'm expected to do. Especially while standing the whole time. Is there anyone with experience as a first time attendee to a Greek Orthodox Church in the US who could give me a brief guide (other than '12 things I wish I knew' which has only confirmed the problems listed above) to follow? Do they usually give out order of service leaflets as they do in other Christian denominations?

I've also heard that there can be dress codes associated with Orthodox Churches and they can change depending on the Church. The Cathedral I'm attending doesn't specify anything on their website. What would you recommend a man and a woman wear for a first visit so as not to stand out or offend?

"What makes Orthodoxy the ""One True Church""?",watchforthinkpol,1625779789,"Hi, I've been curious about Orthodoxy for a while now, but I have some wonderings about the ecclesiology of what makes the ""one true church"" the ""one true church"".

---

The major branches of traditional liturgical Christianity have very different ecclesiological views.

Roman Catholicism teaches that the ""one true church"" comprises all jurisdictions in communion with the Holy See. This includes Roman and Eastern Catholicism, as well as some ordinariates. Though this idea helps give Catholics a clear-cut sense of who's in the church and who's out, papal supremacy appears to me to lack proper historical backing.

High-Church Anglicanism teaches that the ""one true church"" comprises all jurisdictions that accept the seven ecumenical councils and whose holy orders are traceable back to the apostles, but these jurisdictions need not be in communion with one another. This means that the ""one true church"" includes Catholics, Orthodox, Lutherans, Old Catholic, etc. Some might call this idea ""branch theory"".

What exactly is it that the Orthodox Church teaches? As far as I understand it, the ""one true church,"" according to Orthodoxy, includes all jurisdictions in communion with the historic Pentarchy (minus Rome) and all the rest of the patriarchates in that communion. [But perhaps that's an oversimplification or incorrect; correct me if I'm wrong]

-

Anyway, I'm a bit confused. If this is how Orthodoxy defines what constitutes the ""one true church,"" where does that leave Constantinople and Moscow? The two are in schism *only with each other* but remain in communion with all the other Orthodox patriarchates. Are they still both part of the ""one true church"" -- and if so, how can the church be one and true and yet be so divided? 

Imagine a few hypotheticals. (1) Suppose that the Moscow-Constantinople became even more divisive and other patriarchates began to ally themselves with one side or the other and enter into schism with all the ""opposed"" patriarchates. Imagine that this carried so far so as to completely split the church down the middle. Then the historic Orthodox communion would be broken -- then where would the ""one true church"" be?

As a second hypothetical (2), imagine that a few patriarchates resumed communion with Rome. Say, for example, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Serbia, and the OCA entered back into communion with Rome, but that the other patriarchates maintained the millennium-long schism. What Catholics then be part of the ""one true church"" or would they not be?

---

This makes me feel like the Anglo-Catholics' branch theory is more accurate than the Orthodox theory, because the former does not involve confusing scenarios like the hypotheticals I mentioned, but rather focuses on the linkage of valid sacraments as forming the ""one true church"", even when some of its branches may have fallen into heresy and formally be in schism. But I feel like I don't know very much on this subject and would be happy to know what any of you have to say! Like I said, I'm very interested and Orthodoxy, but feel like this problem in my mind is unresolved.

Doubts and worries,--Moser--,1625762065,"I was raised as a Christian Orthodox. I had faith in Jesus but I started losing it.

I think I started thinking ""what if Jesus is not real and I have to abstain from sexual pleasure for nothing?""


I started doubting and ended up thinking that there other religions and theories and traditiond about the universe. Why Christianity is 100% real and all others false?

A Christian will say read the Bible, A Muslim will say read the Qur'An.


I think there are people who really think that their religion is the right one. What if Christianity is a false religion? What if all religions are false?


I think some Christians agree that there is no evidence that confirms that the Bible is the word of God and thats why it is called having faith.


If there is no evidence, then, isnt natural for some people to have diffetent religions or choose not to have faith?

I mean, why I should trust the Christian tradition? Jews also have a tradition.


I started hearing opinions from agnostics and they made more sense to me than the Bible.

I just cant believe that God created hell and allowed our sinful nature, accepts only perfect people to enter heaven (impossible) and gives the gift of faith to enter heaven through Jesus. When it comes to faith isnt natural for some people not to have faith?

We live in a world that there is fraud and suffering and evil. We see people getting manipulated easily. Isnt natural of me being suspicious of the Bible?


Not only that  but Christians disagree each other about some things. I do not know what to believe.


God knows that we are in a corrupted world. Would He expect us to just believe what others say when He knows that there is much manuplation in this world?


Even Thomas doubted Jesus. Didnt Jesus perform miracles in order for people to believe in Him? I have not seen Jesus but there are texts about His miracles. Its not the same. So, I cant blame myself for not having faith.",OrthodoxChristianity

Empty,wwwgoon,1625694865,"Hello brothers and sisters, Christ is in our midst. Ever since I found Orthodoxy, started attending liturgy, removing sinful things from my life, everything that I used to enjoy and find purpose in is no longer interesting. I used to play basketball but I no longer enjoy it because the adrenaline clouds my brain, I want to keep my mind grounded and attentive. I used to make music, but I was scared that my music had underlying sinful spirits, so I removed my entire discography from the internet, and from my computer, and completely quit. Entertainment I used to enjoy feels boring. The company of my friends is no longer enjoyable, seeing them drinking and smoking, hearing their boasts and stories of debauchery. This emptiness has made me anxious. The only time I feel fulfilled and satisfied is during liturgy, but that's only 2 hours a week. I've even considered the monastic life, but that's a far fetch for me.

I don't miss these things at all, but the loss of them has left my days empty, I have nothing to do. So the reason I'm making this post is because I'm looking for things to do that aren't sinful, and I thought the people in this subreddit could help me find interests, give examples of things you enjoy, and where to find good Christian friends.

Was the inability of St. Mary to enter the Church a metaphor,AllisModesty,1625688809,"I was watching this great, short documentary on the life of my favourite saint, saint Mary of Egypt, on Trisagion films. In it, it describes in detail St. Mary‚Äôs inability to enter the church, and how she tries will all her might to enter the church if her own physical strength; however, in my mind we can understand the physical church to represent union with Christ and the physical struggle to represent a prideful (or otherwise Attempt of our own perceived spiritual strength) to ‚Äúrepent‚Äù (and thus misunderstand the nature of repentance.

Has anyone provided an official hermeneutic for this specific part of her story? Am I correct in my interpretation that her inability to enter the church of her own strength represents our inability to save ourselves?

That plus the fact that Christianity stopped making sense to me, maeks it diffcult to follow Jesus.

Some Christians say that Christianity makes sense because we need a savior. It may make sense to them but that does not mean that it is proof that what the Bible says is the truth.

Personally, the Bible and especially the church do not make sense to me. Since something does not make sense to me, that means that I cant have faith.

If I try to have faith and ignore all the doubts and questions, that is like forcing myself that may result in brainwashing.

So, how to live the difficult life of a Christian when I cant find sense?

Do you think I should go on the trip with my friend and if not how can I explain it to them I can‚Äôt go without sound like a nut case lol thanks

For context: I basically made an OCD related vow that I would stop indulging in sexual sin and if I couldn‚Äôt I wanted God to kill me in a plane crash since I was traveling to the West coast a couple of weeks since then and thought that would get me to stop sinning.

So that would mean astrology and tarot reading must be real to a certain extent but we just have to stay away from it. Am I just reading too much into this?

i have lost my faith and I feel as if I may not find it agian.,--Moser--,1625566796,"I have lost my faith in Jesus. I just have my doubts that the Bible is the word of God and I have bigger doubts about church. I would like to have converstation about what bugs me. Lets start with the Bible first.

Bible:

I do not reject the Bible but I have my doubts that it is the word of God. Simply because ther are other religious texts (you can check internet), why I should reject other religious texts, traditions, religiond, theories but accept that Christianity is the real one?

Church:

-  1) I have read opinions from Christians that annoyed me. There was an orthodox who was saying that Christians will end up in hell for not participating in reading devotional hymns. He also supported that it would be nice to be penalties for sinners and unbelievers from the goverment. Maybe he meant prison.

-  2) I learned that an orthodox monk rejected a gift of sheets because they had flowers and he considered them prideful.

-  3) There are some orthodox beliefs and stories that I simply cant believe. There is a story about a woman who sinned but did not confessed it to a priest (sacrament of confession) but prayed for her sin alone. She died and went to hell and Theotokos brought her back to life so she could confess to a priest. The woman confessed and went to heaven. I just cant believe these stories.

-  4) Why sex with your girlfriend/boyfriend is a sin, if it is something serious? From a very little search I did, I cant find verses about how marriage should be done. If a woman and a man agree to live with each other and love each other, isnt like a marriage? The Bible forbids forcination but in greek, it says about ""pornoi"" which means prostitutes. Being a prostitute and having sex with the person that you plan to be with, is total different.

-  5) Some Christians believe that it is a sin for a woman to wear pants mostly because of the verse from the O.T that says about the clothing of man and woman. Since when pants are considered that only men should wear them? And if some Christians want to follow that verse, why dont they follow all rules of O.T?

-  6) A Christian here on reddit, was stating that its a sin to have company with non-believers.

-  7) If church is always right, why changed opinions? If I am right, church was telling people to repent publicly but now they do not. Church rejected evolution but now accepts it?

-  8) I see Christians talking about prayers and repeating them. Fasting in Wednesday and Friday because of the tradition. Is that what Jesus is really about? Participating in rituals?

-  9) Many Christians are believing that the Bible is the truth because it makes sense to them. That we all have sinned and there must be a savor. Does that prove that the Bible is really the word of God? Yet, they tell you that it is our choice not to have faith but we will burn in hell.

I am suspicious of the Bible but I am even more suspicious of the church. Do I have to follow all these rules which some are difficult to follow and do that for as long as I live, even if Christianity does not make sense to me?

Does really an unbeliever deserve to suffer ETERNALLY for not having faith? When it comes to faith isnt natural for some people to simply not have faith? Even for other sins like sexual pleasure, seem normal to me because it is our nature to have urges. For how long can someone avoid it?

If Christian God is merciful and loving, why He would send, if He will send, good and honest people who are unbelievers? My mind just refuses to believe it.

I am in a state in which I am worried for not having faith because what if Jesus is real? If the Bible is not the word of God, then what happens after death?

Many people have different religions, theories, traditions and they really seem to believe them like a Christian does for his religions.

There are people who believe in simulation theory. Some claim to have seen the truth through drugs and they share commom experiences. There is a man on internet who claims to have talked with aliens and that we are in a simulation world in which a parasite is controlling all evil.

After all these, I cant have faith in Jesus. I am not saying that I will believe something else. I am just in a state that I do not know what to believe. And I think thats honest. Yet, some Christians will tell me that I will end up in hell in this state.

I am a man who has depression and do not know what to believe. I still try to avoid sinning from fear but I cant say that I have faith.Do I really deserve hell?",OrthodoxChristianity

Yesterday I attended Divine Liturgy for the first time,ironicsadboy,1625503399,"Hi yall. A few days ago I [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/oby87b/considering_orthodoxy_now_what/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) a post here about how I‚Äôm now considering Orthodoxy and I already knew how vital it was for me to just go to church, but the comments and the kindness were a boost in motivation for me to finally go. As I‚Äôve said in the first post, when I started inquiring into religion for real I made the mistake of reducing this search to what I could read in my room. It took me way over a year to go to a catholic mass after I started discerning Catholicism (the fact that I wanted a TLM also influenced this). Since I began looking into Orthodoxy I decided that I wasn‚Äôt gonna commit the same error, so yesterday morning, after a little more than a month starting to seriously discern this faith, I attended Divine Liturgy.
As you know from the previous post, there are 6 jurisdictions in Brazil: antiochian, greek, ukranian (under the EP), russian, polish and serbian. I still plan on visiting the 4 jurisdictions in my state, but yesterday I chose the antiochian cathedral became it was easier to get there (it only took me about 2 hours). 
As I approached the church there was a deacon at the outside gate, talking with someone and greeting people entering. I think he was a little surprised to see me - I don‚Äôt believe they get much visitors - so we exchanged an awkward ‚Äúhello‚Äù, and I walked in. Liturgy wouldn‚Äôt begin for another half hour, so I walked slowly to the pew. It‚Äôs quite big and full of icons in the side walls, but your eyes are immediately drawn to the iconostasis, which is more elaborated than the icons at the walls. While the walls had big pairs of paintings at regular intervals, one on top of the other, totalizing 8 on each wall, the iconostasis was high and completely decorated with the usual icons, and it was crowned by a big icon of the crucifixion. 
The people who were there, some 5 or 6, mostly old, seemed a bit surprised to see me there, but didn‚Äôt mind it. One old man approached me and gave me a church calendar, with the main feasts of the church and relevant dates for the parish. At the end of the church, in front of the altar, I saw the bishop talking with the choir singer. 
As people walked in they lit a candle and put it over a plate with sand. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a name for it. I didn‚Äôt join in because I don‚Äôt really know the etiquette of it, if it‚Äôs just something for the orthodox. The bishop then walked through the pews greeting the people, and I heard some arabic. I think about half the parish is immigrant; there was a great syro-lebanese influx to Brazil in the beginning of the last century, and the bishop himself is lebanese. 
I was the last one he greeted, at the last pew. He had a heavy accent, naturally, but he‚Äôs fluent In Portuguese. He asked for my name, and I also told him that I had made contact through the Instagram page. He had been notified that I‚Äôd be visiting, so he asked more about my religious upbringing, my age and what I did in life. He was very kind to get my number and say that he‚Äôd provide a priest to ‚Äúteach me Orthodoxy‚Äù. No, there was no reddit moment of me trying to pull a know-it-all to the bishop, I was very happy that he was so approachable. Maybe that‚Äôs a silver lining of Orthodoxy being so small here. I don‚Äôt think I could get to meet the catholic archbishop (who‚Äôs also a cardinal) of my city in a million years. This conversation was quick, but very nice. Liturgy was about to start.
I‚Äôm not completely familiar with the Liturgy of St John Crysostom yet, but it began with choir (an old lady and a younger man) singing what I‚Äôm pretty is the Gloria in excelsis. The choir sang mostly in Portuguese but there was some arabic throughout. When the curtain of the iconostasis were pulled I saw this brazilian priest - the bishop was only concelebrating, and he wasn‚Äôt fully vested. There were two processions on total, and the priest sang most of it, and he used Portuguese all the time. Sometimes it was a little hard to discern the words because of the singing, but the atmosphere was otherworldly. I appreciate very much the silence of the TLM, but I also thoroughly enjoyed how engaging the Divine Liturgy is. 
There were much more people than I expected, and I think that‚Äôs because someone had died, so there was a ‚ÄúTrisagion‚Äù, which by the context I understood as being a small liturgy for the departed servant at the end of the Liturgy. The people were a little out of sync with all the sitting and standing up, but that‚Äôs ok. 
I was surprised by the fact that the homily (preached by the bishop) was after the consecration, and communion after the homily. Not gonna lie, I‚Äôm still not over the fact that you share a single communion spoon for the whole congregation, and not just because of the current plague. But if I do convert I‚Äôll just get over it.
When liturgy was done I waited until everyone had talked to the bishop until I could approach himself, to thank him for the welcome. He asked what I thought of it and repeated that they‚Äôll be in touch with me. I thanked him, and at some point I mentioned that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to be there every month, but maybe two times a month. The atmosphere among the congregation was very emotional because they were given condolences to the man who‚Äôd lost his mother. From the outside they seemed like a close and vibrant community. There were some young adults, one young family with children. I left really happy that I went there.
Every time I‚Äôm in church I get self conscious about the liturgy, what‚Äôs being said, where such text comes from, if I‚Äôd read anything about the development of the liturgy, which kind of gets in the way of me getting ‚Äúcaught in the moment‚Äù and being absorbed by it. Not in a ‚Äúpentecostal service‚Äù kind of way, but I wanted to feel something beyond an intellectual satisfaction that liturgy was well done. Ok, it was my first time and I felt way better than any other time. I hope that this grows in me. It was heaven on earth, so I don‚Äôt want to just watch and take notes as an outsider.

do i really have to follow what the church says?,-Mozser-,1625477404,"I have lost my faith almost completely but even if I find my faith I do not want to follow the church.

It seems to me that there are rules that are not being stated in the Bible. For example, an orthodox told me that there will be Christians in hell for not participating in reading of devotional hymns (i think).

It is as if almost everything leads to hell. Since when living with your girlfriend and having sex is a sin?

If the man and woman have agreed to move in together and they are in love and decided to spend the rest of their lives together, isnt that marriage?

From a very little search that I have done, I cant find any instructions in the Bible about what is a marriage.

Also, the word forcinator in greek is ""pornoi"" (prostitutes). There is a difference between a prostitute and someone who is having sex with the woman that he loves and has decided to live with her, even if they have not attended the sacrament of marriage.

I am just getting discouraged to follow Jesus by following the church. An orthodox monk rejected a gift of sheets because they had flowers and he considered them too prideful.

I understand that I must be a good and honest person and that I must help others and repent when I fail. But having to follow rules of the church seems to much for me.

I understand that skipping church may make me lose focus on Jesus but I do not want to live with the fear that if I skip church that automatically counts as a sin.

I understand that going with different women may be a sin but I cant understand why having sex with the woman that I decided to spend the rest of my life with her, is a sin.

an other orthodox monk told me that it is a sin for a woman to wear pants. Since when all rules from the Old Testament are being applied today? There is a verse that speaks about the dressing of woman and man but it does not directly state that the woman cant wear pants.

Also, there are other ruels in the Old Testament. Why Orthodoxy applies some of them only?",OrthodoxChristianity

I am having a hard time understanding why communion is not open to all Christians at Orthodox Churches. Even if you see outsiders as hellbound, did Jesus not take communion with Judas? In 1 Cor 11 they talk about people taking communion unworthily as eating and drinking judgement upon themselves, not the people who offered them the communion and ate with them. It has been exceedingly hard to find a concise or straightforward answer on this outside of the response that they only take communion with those they are 100% sure they are in union with, but saying you're not in union with another because you don't share the personal convictions of a church seems a bit like putting the cart before the horse.

The Cult of Mary and the Orthodox Church,sauron846,1625277364,"Yes, I know this title looks a bit controversial, but before I get flamed let me state that this is actually going to be a question. I'm just now starting my journey into the Orthodox Church, but I'm coming from Catholicism. I wasn't a confirmed member of the Catholic Church, but I was baptized into it as an infant and converted back in beliefs later in life. I spent most of my time growing up as a Baptist, so the observations I'll make here along with my question are most likely heavily influenced by that.

Having spent more than the last decade as a Catholic, probably the biggest thing that really stuck in my craw about Catholicism was the heavy focus on Mary. Now, what the Catholic and Orthodox Churches teach about Mary on a basic level is something I have no problem with, and in fact it makes much more sense than what I was taught as a Baptist. In a nutshell, Mary is the Theotokos (Mother of God) and is worthy of veneration, but she is not to be worshipped.

What my problem with Catholicism in regards to this isn't the teaching, but in what is practiced. In my time in the Catholic Church, it was hard to avoid seeing the EXTREME veneration of Mary. Many Catholics seem to be heavily focused on Mary, even to the point to where they constantly talk about and revere her so much that you'd think she was the only thing that matters in the church. In short, many Catholics seem to be Mary worshippers, not God worshippers.

In regards to the Orthodox teaching of Mary, again I have no problem with it whatsoever. So my question is this - am I alone in thinking that Catholics tend to put too much focus on Mary? Do many Orthodox do the same? Is there something I'm missing here or not completely understanding? I would greatly appreciate any feedback that you all can provide.",OrthodoxChristianity

Orthodox belief about the Real Presence,sevenrajas,1625255438,"I've been formally inquiring into Orthodoxy for about 8 months (via agnosticism). I'm convinced that conditional on Christianity being true, Orthodoxy has the strongest claim to the truth. However, there remain a lot of points which are fuzzy/uncomfortable to me, and one of these is the Real Presence.

In particular, I have a hard time understanding what Orthodox Christians mean when they say the Eucharist is *really* the Body and Blood of Christ. Sometimes when I see people question what that means, the responses are just to repeat loudly ""look at John 6, it's obvious"". However, to me it seems ludicrous to believe that the Eucharist turns into the *literal* body and blood of Christ, because I would only believe something is the literal body and blood of a human if it has the properties of the body and blood of a human - it consists of blood cells, skin cells, probably looks red, doesn't taste very good, etc. (obviously that's non exhaustive)

So, is it a consistent Orthodox belief to say that 
1. I do not believe that any of the blood cells, skin cells, etc. of the physical body in which Jesus Christ walked the Earth some 2000 years ago are present in the Eucharist. 
2. There is some definition of truth by which Jesus is ""really present"" in the Eucharist. 

I don't have a clear understanding of what such a definition of truth would be. Jonathan and Matthieu Pageau's work has been useful for helping me become comfortable with some Orthodox doctrine, and the implications of their worldview (which they claim, and I take on faith, is somewhat based on the vision of St Maximus the Confessor) is that thinking scientifically is not useful/uninteresting for understanding Scripture as early Christians understood it. That's definitely useful for understanding Genesis and some other parts of the Old Testament I've read, but it becomes more of a struggle with the New Testament.

Considering Orthodoxy: now what?,ironicsadboy,1625183076,"**TLDR:** I'm starting to learn about Eastern Orthodoxy and this is my first post of this kind here. Questions will be **bolded**, in case you don't want to read my whole story and thoughts and just answer my questions.

&amp;#x200B;

As I start to write this I have no idea how long this post will be. Maybe the best preface is to say that religion as a whole is extremely important to me, in the sense that if any of this is true, this is the most important and urgent thing in life. So all my stakes in this are personal. There was a time in which it was just fun to treat theological research as an intellectual exercise, but now it's a matter of yes or no, life or death. I started questioning my upbringing by looking into Roman Catholicism, but after some time of discernment there doesn't seem to be an easy answer.

I was raised as an evangelical protestant with some reformed influences in my early teenagehood. Once I left a reformed/calvinist cult group (long story)  I knew I couldn't return to the evangelicalism of my parents, which was heavily criticized by the reformeds, but reformed theology already looked too unsound for me, so I traded it for basically nothing. I stumbled upon Catholicism sort of by accident, by reading some non-religious literature with Catholic themes. Particularly I remember coming across the concept of real presence for the first time reading James Joyce's *Portrait of the artist as a young man* (a semi-biographical story about a young man who comes close to priesthood but ends up leaving the Church and his country). 

So beginning in 2019 I started reading about church history and theology, and pretty much just asking questions at the Catholic sub. I guess I followed the normal route of going from pop apologetics to in depth theology, and I really fell in love with the writings of both John Henry Newman and pope Benedict XVI (and I still feel deeply connected to them, though I'm not so sure about Rome anymore). This alone caused great pain and anger in my parents, which at first I took for silly fundamentalism (and it was, to a point), but I can see their point better now: the Church I talked about wasn't the Catholic Church that they knew, and that I'd eventually know by getting out of my room and actually seeing what Catholicism looks like on the ground. It's the all too common ""trad"" dilemma. 

I was basically sure about converting to the RCC, until a fight I had with my evagelical parents earlier this year acted as a sort of ""wake up call"" that I should be a little more intellectually honest about it, and not just go with my taste. Since then I started questioning deeper some of the things that made me uncomfortable with Catholicism, and the biggest one is the absolute abyss between the theory and the reality of the Church.

It's not just the fact that 99% of the parishes in my country are like a watered down version of Catholicism (because I have defended the Council online, which is the only coherent option for a convert), but the absurdity of the fact that there are as many traditional catholic parishes (TLMs) as there are orthodox parishes in my state - in a place where orthodoxy is less then 0.1% of the population.

As one popular catholic blogger put in a recent infamous [article](https://skojecfile.steveskojec.com/p/against-crippled-religion?r=hux7r&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=copy) (and I can't overstate how much I related to that article) where he describes his ""trad burnout"", traditionalism is itself an innovation because catholics back then weren't ""traditionalists"", they were just... catholic. The ""traditional movement"" is reactionary against the very Church that should uphold said tradition, and that has discarded it.

And so at this point I feel like pretending that what has happened with Catholicism in the last 60 years wasn't a revolution - specially in my latin american country - is a massive cope. And at this point nothing guarantees me that a similar revolution didn't take place in the western church from the 9th to the 12th century. Funny how a similar thought led me out of Protestantism: if there was such a chasm between modern evangelicalism and the first reformers, how can I be sure of the continuity between the reformers and the early church they claim to represent?

Of course a catholic can point to many cases of corruption in orthodoxy, and I can think of a few too, but that's not the silver bullet they think it is because whatever corruptions there may be in orthodoxy - the local patriarchal schisms, the secular States' influence in the churches, the ethnocentrism, the lack of a centralized authority -, none of those contradict the claims orthodoxy makes about itself. The problem with Catholicism isn't its crisis, because crisis and corruption are natural to humans, but those crisis *in light of* the insanely narrow and exclusivist claims Rome makes.

Of course, as I have written in a comment at the catholic sub, the decision fatigue involved in figuring out the One True Church‚Ñ¢ is exhausting. We can't possibly read every Church Father and every Church document on top of reading every piece of scholarship from the last 2000 years in order to get it right. And the silver bullets aren't good enough if you're honest about it (""but the KEYS and the ROCK"" or ""but Rome ADDED to the creed which is contrary to the CANONS""). If I take a personal approach, my choices are either the bordeline-syncretist and modernist local Novus Ordo parishes, a TLM which is 1.5 hour away, or one orthodox parish from the 6 overlapping jurisdictions in here, which vary from 30 min to 2 hours away in distance.

When I started getting to know Catholicism I tried to convince myself that even a bad NO is just as valid, and that may be true, but regardless of that it's not spiritually healthy for me. I have no business in a church with drums. As for the TLM available, it's exactly what I expected and just like the online TLMs,  if a little more unwelcoming, though we can blame it on the pandemic, and I also didn't talk to anyone there. In fact, the whole approach to ""validity"" is the first thing I can think of when I see eastern christians accusing the latins of legalism: the process of justifying staying in a Church that allows such liturgical mess, or the absurdly stupid logic behind approving NFP but not contraception, or the inevitable conclusion that schismatics can have valid orders (after all, all it takes is the mechanical laying of hands to pass down the episcopal order, right?).

Maybe my reaction is a little too emotional, but that's because I, for one, feel so sorry for the Latin Church. I love its history and its rites, its liturgy, music and vestments, but everywhere you look - except for some islands of orthodoxy - it's rotten in a way that other churches don't seem to be. Again, the issue isn't exactly the ""crisis"", but the crisis in relation to the claims that Rome makes about itself. EO has it figured out in a better way, if I understood it correctly: don't follow a heretic bishop. But if you're roman, you either go to the crappy local parish (which I hope we can admit are the majority), commute (which isn't always possible, contrary to what some online trads seem to believe) or you're a schismatic possibly without salvation. 

Ok, so after all the rambling about my quick, but intense contact with Catholicism, I'll move on to when I started looking up Orthodoxy, about a month ago. I knew some things about it just by being in Catholic circles, but of couse there's so much more to learn. I'm trying not to make the same mistake I made with Catholicism, which is reading too much about before actually coming into contact with it, and so not romanticizing it. But at the same time I have to know *something*, so I read Ware's *The Orthodox Church*. First question comes in here: **What to read after ""The Orthodoxo Church""?** I'm thinking of buying *For the life of the world*, but I'm taking any recommendations. 

(As a side note, I was sort of disappointed to know that Metropolitan Kallistos Ware seems to be relaxing his views on female ordination. I wouldn't be called an ultra-conservative by any means, but we have to draw the line at some point. I hope this is just him - as I have read somewhere - mistaking the Church for an university classroom, where anything can be discussed. I've watched an interview of his where he says that he's not in favor of female ordination, but that he doesn't think that the Church has properly addressed the matter. Maybe the arguments aren't good enough for his liking, but in this day and age I don't know what more can the Church say about the matter from a disciplinary and dogmatinc point of view.)

Other than him and this book, the other orthodox christian I've read is the controversial DBH, at first not because of his orthodoxy, but because of his universalism, which I know to be a very marginal stance in the Church. So here comes question number two: **As if it wasn't enough to feel that my first reason to look up Orthodoxy (namely, disappointment at the Latin Church) wasn't ""good enough"", I also sometimes feel like having the possibility of being an universalist as a reason to come into the Church to possibly be a very bad idea, given how controversial it is, so what do I do if my reasons sound good enough?** I wish I had a great calling story, I wish to God that I had a vision or a voice in my ear telling me where to go, but none of that has happened, so I have only my mind to rely on.

Now that I'm spending time around Orthodox circles new reasons have appeared though. To name one, I really like how the Church Fathers are an actual part of the life of the Church. While in the Catholic side the Fathers are almost always only referred to as prooftext against protestants, in the EO they are what's read, praised and preached. **I have some editions of some Fathers, but where can I read them for real, and how do I read them?** Of course sermons and theological works are not the same, and I don't know how to approach them with the right mind, instead of just looking for phrases that sound catholic (or orthodox, as of right now). 

Finally, I'll try to go to an orthodox church as soon as possible. After some online digging, the situation in Brazil is this: there are 6 jurisdictions here: greek and ukranian under the EP, Antiochian, russian, polish and serbian. The Antiochian Church itself has overlapping jurisdictions, with one archdiocese of S√£o Paulo and all Brazil, and one Apostolic Vicariate of Rio de Janeiro directly under Patriarch John X. 3 of the bishops don't live in Brazil, as the greek, russian and serbian archdioceses are all based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The ukranian archbishop, the polish archbishop, and the two antiochian bishops live in Brazil. The ukranian archbishop (who's based in the South region) and the polish archbishop (who's in Rio de Janeiro) are brazilian, along with a polish auxiliary bishop for the Northeast region, who's also brazilian. The antiochian archbishop of S√£o Paulo and the antiochian vicar of Rio de Janeiro are foreigners (I think lebanese). 

All but the polish and serbian jurisdictions are mainly ethnic and serve mostly descendants of immigrant families, specially antiochian, given the large syrian-lebanese immigration in Brazil. In my state there are all but the serbian and ukranian churches. I'm thinking of visiting all four (greek, russian, antiochian and polish), though I'm thinking that maybe I'll adapt easier to the polish church, which is meant to serve primarily non immigrant communities. But I was happily surprised to watch a liturgy in the antiochian Vicariate page. It was beautiful, and had arabic and portuguese mixed. I'm not too fond of the arabic style of chanting (sorry, I don't know the actual name) but the liturgy was great. 

I also came to take a look at the small orthodox scene in the brazilian web, and it's mainly led by lay people and some priests. What I have in my mind is that if I do convert to Orthodoxy, I want to do everything for it, and I think that since most brazilians have no idea Orthodoxy exists, there's a golden opportunity of presenting the Church in the right way to the wider public. **I know the catechumenate is long, but how do you think my attitude of eagerness to ""spread the word"" would be well received by the orthodox?** I don't want to sound like I'm getting ""convertitis"" before even converting, but I sense that there's more of a ""come and see"" attitude and that you don't proselytize like evangelicals, but still, the Church has to put itself out there (specially if you take a hardcore ""no salvation outside of the visible Church"" stance). 

Finally, prayer. **What should I read to pray more and better?** Look, this sub is great, but I swear that half of it is ""You should talk to a priest"" in the comments. Great! I will talk to a priest as soon as possible. But I also need to learn how to properly pray. I don't want to go from not praying directly to hesychasm because... come on, I'm a newbie. But truth be told, I've never been good at prayer, not even as an evangelical, and I feel like I can't neglect this anymore. I don't want to try Orthodoxy like I tried Catholicism: mainly as an intellectual quest. That burned me out and left me extremely disappointed. Maybe if I was born around the 1900's in the time of the ultramontanist revival, with all its baroque and tridentine devotion, I'd never have considered going East, but I just can't believe that being in communion with the pope is necessary for my salvation. Not when the actual Catholic Church near me (not the Church of the books, of the history) is either a charismatic knock-off or a den of liberation theology. I can't bring myself to accept the cognitive dissonance of going to a parish like that thinking that it's alright as long as the eucharist is ""valid"" and that I'm in communion with the pope. 

I think that's about it. I hope I can make to an orthodox parish soon. Unless I move out closer to a parish, I probably won't be able to go every sunday, because of the train fees, but I for what I've read that's alright. There are some orthodox that can only make it to liturgy a few times a year. I think I can make it with one or two sundays a month before I can live closer to a parish, assuming I convert. And if I do, I'll definitely try to move closer to the community and getting involved. I've wasted so much time and effort in useless things. Or rather good things, but without the underlying ""big reason"" for it all. The whole quest for the Church is exhausting, and I wish there was an easy answer. Whatever I decide, I'll pray saying: *""Lord, I'm sorry my reason can only bring me this far, and forgive me if I'm terribly wrong about which Church to belong to"".* 

For the last month or so Orthodoxy has been giving me some peace. Its decentralization, its healthy liturgical life at the parish level, its mystical and non legalistic approach. Maybe it's the honeymoon phase. I also fell in love with Catholicism, though with Orthodoxy it seems like you pretty much get what you read about. I really hope so. I could never go back to protestantism, I can't believe in the roman church anymore, so this is all I have left. I need God, and I need to the certainty that I have good the right way, in the right church. It's either that or unbelief. And like the man in the gospel, *""Lord, I believe. Help me in my unbelief""* (Mark 9:24).",OrthodoxChristianity

How do I be bolder in faith,asthegearsturn,1625150605,"Last night I brought a lot of shame on myself. I am a 23 year old Catechumen who is quick to proclaim that I‚Äôm a Christian, but have so much trouble discussing my faith with nonbelievers or learning how to discern between being faithful and open to discussion and being evangelistic in a Protestant sense. 

This may seem like a small situation to some, but basically I have two friends who are more agnostic who asked to play a song on my aux last night. Of course as soon as their song plays, them knowing I‚Äôm a Christian, the author begins to mock Christianity and martyrdom. Of course this immediately disturbed me and slightly angered me, though in the desire to avoid any sort of tension I just let the song keep playing instead of unhooking the aux. it disturbs me even more that I consider these two close friends and thoigh I don‚Äôt speak a lot, they know very clearly that I am a Christian looking to be baptized and to live a Christian lifestyle, so it offended me a bit honestly, but also overall it made me personally feel like a coward for not saying anything or intervening. In anxiousness to avoid any sort of argument I just let it play. 


Ever since, I feel so guilty honestly and almost like I‚Äôve denied Christ in just allowing the song to play. I truly wish I wouldn‚Äôt have even let myself hear it. My unwillingness to intervene in such a small situation when it played made me realize how lacking in boldness I am. I don‚Äôt wanna make this mistake again and have repented but honestly the guilt is really Lingering. Please pray for me if you‚Äôre willing that I grow more in boldness and in knowing what to do in such situations. That said, I feel like this may be the last straw as far as our friendship goes. Not because of the music only, but because in all honesty I struggle a lot with adapting to the Orthodox way of life as it is and hanging out with some of my older friends really seems to make me feel like I‚Äôm living a double life (even not shying away from proclaiming that I am a Christian, I still feel like my behavior itself around them doesn‚Äôt reflect my faith) and I‚Äôm truly sick of it and of lacking boldness. I feel like I‚Äôve betrayed God and if I do it so easily in such small regards I question how I could ever expect to be bold like the saints. But I don‚Äôt want to stay in this place and truly want to learn from this, so I pray He takes this guilt off me and helps me to move forward from here and to be bolder. Sorry for the long post but i was honestly just troubled by my own lack of boldness and felt the need to talk about it and to seek advice/ prayers. Thabks and God bless",OrthodoxChristianity

Confusion about the place of the Church Fathers,Herobrian117,1625140693,"I understand that the Orthodox Church places a lot of emphasis on the early Church. Normally if they have a consensus on something, then it is accepted, but there are areas in this which confuses me. For example, most, if not all, the Church Fathers believed the Earth to be a couple thousand years old, and that many of the early parts of Genesis were literal. However, today, the Church permits belief in millions of years and belief that the Genesis events were symbolic, or atleast, were events, but happened differently than how it was historically perceived. I have no problem with people pointing out that the Church Fathers were simply using the science of their day, but the thing is, is that they often used Holy Scripture to confirm their beliefs. Are not the Scriptures a matter of Faith and Morals, and thus, we oughtta take their interpretation of Scripture if there is a consensus on it? I only used the age of the earth as an example, to ask how we should view the Patristic interpretation of Scripture in general.

Plus, I'm very familiar with the fact that many Church Fathers were interested in Greek/Platonic philosophy before becoming Christians, or sometimes still being into it while being Christians. When we read the Fathers, how do we know which of their teachings are from purely Christian perspectives, and which ones may have remnants of Platonic influence?",OrthodoxChristianity

Relationship between recitation of the Jesus Prayer and silence in Hesychasm,voltzart,1625093215,"I've been practicing a form of prayer for the past several years, prior to my recent conversion from Catholicism to Greek Orthodoxy, that I would call ""sitting in silence before my creator."" This attitude also translated pretty naturally (though with varying degrees of actual success) into my everyday life, in a way that had the potential to make every activity into a prayer.

One of the things that drew me to Orthodoxy was the practice/path of Hesychasm, as there seemed to be little support for my style of silent prayer in Catholicism. After some enriching discussions with my priest, I've finished the Way of the Pilgrim and have read various excerpts from the Philokalia and other online articles, and I've begun to try to transition to this way of practice.

My question is on the relationship between recitation of the Jesus Prayer and silence. I've been reciting it mentally, and so far the recitation has seemed to be spiritually fruitful, but I find myself longing for the actual silence (both physical and mental) that I used to practice, in which my connection to God felt more tangible, and which also seemed to be more compatible with my daily activities (especially tasks requiring brain power) than the constant mental recitation of the prayer. Does the transition from ""prayer of the mind"" to ""prayer of the heart"" entail an eventual movement toward this mental silence?",OrthodoxChristianity

"For years, I've had a strong inclination to become an Orthodox Christian, but I feel like there is something holding me back.",Uber_Doc,1625080410,"I've been looking into Orthodoxy for a couple years now along with Catholicism. I have a connection to the Orthodox church that I cannot explain in words. I've purchased an icon, a prayer rope, an Orthodox Study Bible, have had strange dreams with Orthodox themes, listen to Orthodox hymns, and find myself saying the Jesus Prayer a lot. Yet, I feel like I can't take the next step. I have attended a few services at the only Orthodox church in my city, but I didn't feel at home there. In addition, I have some theological issues with Orthodoxy that are partially intellectual and partially emotional. 

Intellectually, I am just having a hard time wrapping my head around how the Orthodox Church actually functions hierarchically. I understand the Catholic structure much more easily.

Emotionally, I regularly struggle with the Orthodox teaching on sexuality. I've found it increasingly difficult to believe that LGBT people cannot be in a loving relationship with the person they connect with. I realize that disagreeing with this does not negate my inclination to believe that Orthodoxy is true, but it is a serious emotional barrier. I think about what I would do as a father (hypothetically, I am a married man with no children) if my child came to me and told me they were gay/bi/trans, etc. and I cannot help but feel like I would be supportive of them despite how unbiblical it would be. 

I think I also struggle with a lack of faith ultimately. I've spoken to Orthodox, Catholic, and Baptist ministers about similar issues like this, but I feel like I haven't gotten a good answer. Maybe it's just pride or stubbornness. I'm hoping to find answers here, or at least to be pointed in the right direction.

A Study Which Shows The Impact of the Jesus Prayer,QuietPrism,1625079484,"Thought ya'll would find this interesting and useful!

Excerpt from the article:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Outside of personal testimonies, there has been research on the Jesus Prayer. I recently came across a doctoral dissertation of a friend and colleague of mine who studied the effects of the Jesus Prayer. The title of his dissertation: *The Impact of Contemplative Prayer on Psychological, Relational, and Spiritual Well-Being: A Study of the Jesus Prayer* (George Stavros, Ph.D.), brought to light some interesting data that I‚Äôd like to share with you.  
&gt;  
&gt;The significance of the study, according to Dr. George Stavros, is manifold and I cannot possibly cover it all in this article, so I‚Äôll just highlight a couple of things. In his words, the study was for the purpose of ‚Äúbringing together theoretical, experiential, and empirical literature and research from religious, theological, psychological and medical studies in an attempt to understand the effects of practicing the Jesus Prayer on contemporary persons.‚Äù More specifically, and for our own interests as Orthodox Christians, this study has importance on how the recitation of the Jesus Prayer brings about ‚Äúrelational and healing aspects‚Äù to our lives, both spiritually and psychologically. Forgive me if this is too ‚Äúscientific‚Äù for some of you. Coming from a family of academicians, it was appealing to me and I believe it can be used with those who may place less emphasis on personal ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù testimonies, and lean a bit more toward scientific data. Of course we know that this can only take us so far in God‚Äôs cosmos.  
&gt;  
&gt;Population: The treatment group studied consisted of 88 parishioners from Greek Orthodox congregations throughout the United States. ‚ÄúThere were 45 participants in the experimental group and 43 in the control group. The sample was evenly divided between males and females. The participants ranged in age from 25 to 74, with over half (53%) of the sample under 40 years of age. Virtually all (99%) of the participants were white, and a large number were married (78%) and were parents (75%). Most of the participants were of Greek ethnic background (68%), and 92% identified themselves as being Eastern Orthodox Christians. 83% of the participants had at least college degrees . . . The treatment group was instructed to practice the Jesus Prayer ten minutes daily for a total of thirty days. The Jesus Prayer, ‚ÄúLord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me,‚Äù was prayed continuously while sitting quietly and in solitude.  
&gt;  
&gt;Among several things the study showed, there were two that were very significant. First, ‚ÄúThe treatment group‚Äôs adjusted post-test means on two scales measuring reported relationship with God were significantly higher than those of the control group. Second, the treatment group‚Äôs adjusted post-test means on measures of depression, anxiety, hostility, and interpersonal sensitivity were significantly lower than those of the control group.‚Äù The data showed that the practice of saying the Jesus Prayer ten minutes a day for 30 days sitting quietly, increased one‚Äôs perception of feeling closer to God and decreased one‚Äôs level of depression, anxiety, hostility, and interpersonal sensitivity.

Hello I am an agnostic and I‚Äôve recently read the Bible. It seems very much death related and death focused.

Isa 53:10 ‚Äú But it was the LORD‚Äôs good plan to crush him and cause him grief. Yet when his life is made an offering for sin, he will have many descendants. He will enjoy a long life, and the LORD‚Äôs good plan will prosper in his hands.‚Äù

Jesus refuses to save the other prisons that were being killed with him and instead lets them get killed

Luke 23:29

‚ÄúOne of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!‚Äù

2 Cor 1:6

‚ÄúIf we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.‚Äù

Matthew 16:25

For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.

Followers seemed to be encouraged to die for the gospel.

Obviously a few verses don‚Äôt pain an entire picture but these are the verses that struck out the most. There are plenty of Christians who can‚Äôt wait to die nor consider anything happening here important because they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot citizens here‚Äù.

Sports seem to be adiaphora at best and a passion at worst, and praying for victory can very easily become superstition, but I also can't imagine that, for example, Greece and Russia's world-class soccer teams *don't* get blessed before important matches, or that the deeply-religious [Mateja Ke≈æman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mateja_Ke%C5%BEman) doesn't have a special pregame ritual of his own.

"We, Christians, do not want the salvation of others - and how then do we Christians differ from the adherents of other religions?",Ellenika,1624973781,"First I want to sorry for my not ideal language. The second, I am ready to correct my formulations, if they hurt somebody.

Each religion speaks of its exclusiveness, monopoly on truth. The most ""tolerant"" believer will never tell an opponent: ""I believe in my (sacral name), but yours (other sacral name) is truer."" Although the concepts of salvation are different for all religions. Someone believes that only true believers will be saved, and everyone else will go to hell. Someone does not care, the main thing is that the goddess will make the cow give milk, and the money rang in the wallet, and they will have enough...  And suddenly appears a religion is declared in the world, where in the most important book it says:  God is love.  Not just - ""God loves"". He is love. The Personality of God and His main attribute are identified.  When I think about it, I ask God that everyone be saved. I want this. I, a sinful person who have imperfect relationships with other people - I want this. Does God, who is Love Himself, want this?  I often ask this question to Orthodox people. And I see that they evade in response, often.  I think we must admit that if a Christian does not want everyone to be saved, that means that he wants something different. Something else, in which he himself does not admit.  Isn't this too human, brothers and sisters? Not Godlike?",OrthodoxChristianity

My thoughts after my first Divine Liturgy,sauron846,1624950255,"I just attended my first Divine Liturgy on Saturday. Before going into my thoughts, though, I should probably give a little more backstory to my own path as well as state why my first Divine Liturgy was on a Saturday.

I was raised in an independent fundamentalist Baptist church, and remained there from early childhood until I graduated from high school. When I lost my faith as a young adult, I flitted around with agnostic/atheistic beliefs until my own internal examination of my life experiences (as well as some studying of philosophy) led me back to believing in God. I flirted around with Judaism for a bit but then eventually fell into the Roman Catholic church. I attended RCIA at a parish but didn't complete it due to a number of reasons, but for a while afterwards still considered myself Catholic as far as my beliefs were concerned. A few years ago I started really looking into the Orthodox church and slowly became enamored with it, but still hesitated on joining for a number of reasons. Fast-forward to now, and I'm pretty much ready to go full-tilt.

One of the big problems of why I hesitated on trying to join was due to where I lived. I spent 7 years living in Ukraine, which is where I really started becoming interested in the Orthodox church. However, I didn't jump to join while there due to two reasons: 1. The language barrier, as my Russian and Ukrainian simply wasn't good enough to where I can reasonably discuss theological issues, and 2. the ongoing issue with the breaking away of the Ukrainian church. I came back to the US a little over a year ago, but I live in a small town that only has an Orthodox mission, so attending a Divine Liturgy was put off again because I wasn't sure of when or where I could attend one.

Now, with all of that babbling out of the way, I was able to attend a Divine Liturgy on Saturday at that mission. Actually, I ended up making it there before Divine Liturgy started. There were only 3 people in attendance, and that included the priest and the reader, so I was in essence the only true layperson in attendance. So, my thoughts, in no particular order:

\- The reader and the priest were both very gracious with my newness and showed no expectations of me. I was even allowed to sit for a while without any complaints due to back pain.

\- The service itself obviously seemed a bit basic when compared to videos I've seen of Divine Liturgies on Youtube, but that is probably to be expected due to the low number of attendees. Still, though, the structure was of course the same, and it makes me want to attend again but somewhere that has at least a few more people so I can get a truer sense of what I'm supposed to do at different parts of the liturgy.

\- The priest took some time after service to talk to me, which was quite helpful. My road to the Orthodox church has been mostly an intellectual one, but he quickly picked up on it and reminded me that my prayer life is every bit as important as anything else.

\- The reader, who owns the property that the mission is on, served lunch afterwards, giving me more of a chance to interact with him and the priest. Both were quite friendly and unassuming, and were also quite pleased that I attended.

\- One of the priest's first recommendations was to read the book ""The Orthodox Church"" by Timothy Ware, which I had heard of before but hadn't yet purchased. I ordered it from Amazon as soon as I got home, and thanks to their next-day delivery, I've already been able to start reading it. So far, it's an engaging and informative read.

\- Becoming a catechumen is definitely not a quick process. The priest while talking to me said this phrase several times: ""If you are serious about becoming Orthodox..."". This wasn't said in a skeptical way, but in a way that reminded me that this is a serious undertaking that shouldn't be taken lightly at all.

Overall, I'd have to say this experience has made me even more serious about becoming Orthodox, as well as helping to realign my expectations of the church as well as focus on why I want to join. Frankly, my intellectual pursuit of Orthodoxy is quickly changing to a much more spiritual focus, and this seems to be opening up a whole new world that I never really took as seriously as I should have before. Anyway, those are my thoughts. Would appreciate any feedback that anyone has about what I wrote here.",OrthodoxChristianity

scrupulosity.,Mikey21420,1624907821,"Im writing this as i need help with a few things, as im not able to attend a church, and be able to ask in person. Ive been struggling with some things for a while, one of them being scrupulosity, or so i think after i read what it meant.

I have intrusive thoughts, and from website where i think that what im experiencing is explained well in words : "" **Scrupulosity OCD** is a common **Obsessive-Compulsive** Disorder (**OCD**) subtype in which a person experiences intrusive, unwanted thoughts, images, or urges about violating their **religious**, moral, or ethical beliefs. "" . I also think that some other definitons of scrupulous such as "" very concerned to avoid doing wrong"" explain my anxiety.

I made a post about it yesterday, and someone did help, to which im thankful :) , but i just find it hard to explain what i feel, and what i think i need to be helped with, and im hoping that maybe i can put this better into words today. 

I feel very anxious about doing something wrong, thinking something wrong, and especially thinking something wrong, as having intrusive thoughts does not help at all. A lot of the time i might just feel guilty about such thoughts, or try to deny them, ignore them, sometimes argue and even consider them, well, im not sure how to explain that part; i dont agree with the bad ideas or thoughts i have, but sometimes they just come in and make me think twice about something, but i still think its a bad idea and/or thought. I dont know.

Im just anxious of thinking or doing something wrong at all times. For example: i dont 100% understand why we pray or what a prayer is, and looking it up on google might sometimes give me different answers ( prayers might not be the right example here, but i hope the idea is portrayed). 

Or for example, i might think that prayers are a way to speak directly to God ( its actually one idea i have) . Ill stress about it, because i dont know if its correct and i feel like ive sinned very badly. I have this feeling with many things, such as should i say that i love God and Jesus Christ? Is it bad? Is it not? Is it wrong to consider God as you would consider a parent?

Some of this might seem obvious to you, but I just dont know. And searching it up sometimes makes me more confused. And at times i might be really careful with any of my opinions. As in not to have the wrong idea, or say the wrong thing, because i feel like i might sin. Sometimes i overthink, or i think i overthink. Confusing, right? Mix it with intrusive thoughts and i get sooooo anxious.

Like, is it bad to think that bad thoughts come from the Devil ( in fact i have a thought right now, should i write ""Devil""? Should i write it with a capital D?) I just have so many thoughts, so many opinions, so you can guess how anxious i start feeling. It doesnt help ive got studies for maths, physics and chemisty. 

Last thing, if someone could clarify for me, when we pray, can it be at any moment, doing anything? Just in my head? For example, could I pray The Jesus Prayer whenever i feel anxious? When im doing some maths work? Should i stop from doing the work and pray, or just in my head as i work? 

I got so many questions. One thing I used to do and still do, but i dont know if i should, as for the same reasons that im anxious of doing something wrong is : ""i believe in God, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit"" and ""I am an Orthodox Christian"". Should i be saying these? Is there something bad if i said these multiple times ( i say it when i have intrusive thoughts, i think it helps to just ignore such thoughts) while working? Or saying them multiple times in a row?

I mean, just now im having thoughts like ""Oh, make it look sad""  or stuff like that, to convince you or something. As if im trying to make it look depressing or something so i can sympathy. Like, i dont even know how to explain.

Id really appreciate any help.",OrthodoxChristianity

"""Have mercy on me, a sinner...""",GoatsandRoses1970,1624902885,"As a Protestant interested in Orthodoxy, I've found that the differences in vocabulary/definitions have been a REAL hurdle sometimes.   Definitions for words such as sin, grace, and faith have VERY different meanings in Orthodoxy as opposed to (at least some) Protestant denominations.  

For those of you from an Orthodox background, when you hear or say the phrase, ""I'm a sinner...""  what does the word ""sinner"" mean to you emotionally?

For example, to me, as a Protestant, the word ""sinner"" carried the connotation of a person who consciously tried to do wrong, who violated a known rule, a ""bad"" person, an evil person, a substandard person, perhaps even a person unworthy of love. I'm not sure that Orthodox would experience this word this way.

Questions in regards to Islam,Jaded-Mixture8465,1624841321,"Hello everyone, I come from an Orthodox family and I love my religion, but recently the existence of Islam has begun to make me severely doubt my faith. I can't help but find many of the points brought up by many Muslim missionaries and apologists rather compelling, for example, they have pointed to various verses in the Quran and hadith that can be verified by modern science such as accurate descriptions of functions of the human anatomy and natural phenomena including descriptions the development of.the human embryo or it's descriptions on the structure of mountains. Another reason that has made me begin to lose faith is the fact that Muhammad was illiterate and had to low of a social status to learn to compose poetry, and the quality of writing in the Quran is undeniably extremely high and is regarded even in Secular circles as one of the greatest works of Arabic literature which is a point many Muslims cite to support their belief that the Quran was not written by a human hand  (essentially that Muhammad would not have been able to write the Quran on his own). There is also a fear factor that has caused me to be this unsettled, a literal reading of the Quran would strongly suggest that I would go to Islamic Hell if I were to remain Orthodox which has made me consider leaving my faith out of sheer anxiety as to my fate if I end up wrong.

I like praying because it feels as if I get a more direct connection with God than if i just thought about some things ( not sure if im right in doing/thinking so, id like some help here):

I dont know if i do have OCD or not, i did not go to a doctor to get it checked or something. However, i do have some things that are pretty OCD like ( checking if i locked a door for literally the 10th time) and also ( no clue if its an OCD thing) a lot of intrusive thoughts.

Its hard for me to explain, these thoughts are sometimes ""doubtful"", as in trying to convince me of stuff as ""proof"" to why i shouldnt believe, or thoughts that come by when i do a certain thing, which is also really hard for me to explain. 

These thoughts end up with me being unfocused ( im studying a lot for maths right now as im still in school), and I just become sad or dissapointed in my self, feeling guilty for some thoughts that come in my mind when i read or do something. I dont even know wether i can classify them as always been intrusive thoughts, but at times its also things that for a split second i dont realise what im doing, and then right after i realize and feel super guilty.

Im just as confused as you probably are right now. English is not my native language, so there might be some mistakes. I dont know how to deal with these thoughts and feelings of guilt. They annoy me a lot when some random atheist thoughts come in, when im reading or doing something. Because I am Christian and I geniunely believe. I really dont know how to deal with some of these thoughts. They make me feel super guilty.

One of the things i do when i feel like i have intrusive thoughts or i overthink stuff, i say in my head or sometimes i speak it is : ""I believe in God, in Jesus Christ and in the Holy Spirit"" and also "" I am Christian Orthodox"" , and I end up saying these quite a few times in a day, and multiple times in a row.

I have always been drawn to the Orthodox aesthetic and chants. There's just something about it that has always touched my soul so to speak. Of course I understand icons aren't just some pretty wall decoration so I treat them with respect. I try to live my life according to Christian morals and values to the best that I can and the icons are a good reminder against temptations for me. How can one sin when the blessed mother is looking at you?

My instinct tells me that it can never be bad to have holy images inside the home even if you aren't part of the religion but I also don't want to make a mockery out of anything.

Is this acceptable?? If so, thoughts on the Icon?? Should I continue?? God Bless!!

i say a central authority judges the 2 churches as the leaders (frankie and barty) rap battle. perhaps some other higher ups could also.

How does Orthodoxy grapple with the implications of the East-West Schism?,Runaway_Poet,1624658816,"Hello,

I‚Äôm a Roman Catholic, and I was curious as to what explanations/philosophies/ideas are common among Eastern Orthodox faithful regarding the implications of the Great Schism. By implications, this is what I mean:

The Latin Church, since the time of the schism, has been wildly successful relative to the fortunes of the east. It has spread rapidly throughout the world, and in terms of size, manages to significantly dwarf the size of the eastern church. If one were to take Protestants as a rotten extension of the Latin Church, as many do, it would seem that nearly all of Christendom is Latin in origin.

While there are many explanations and reasons for why this is the case, I wanted to know what the thoughts are of the Eastern Orthodox about this disparity. Why would God allow the corruption and decline of the majority of the Church, despite promising not to allow the gates of hell to overcome it? From a Catholic perspective, we take a more open approach than I‚Äôve seen expressed by some of the Orthodox in that even with the Great Schism, we recognize the sacraments and orders of the East as being valid and efficacious. I‚Äôve seen it commonly stated that the Orthodox do not believe this is the case with the West, and that the efficacy of the Latin sacraments are doubtful, or are rejected completely. By implication, most Christians throughout history have never actually had access to the sacraments, or the truth of the Church.

How is this problem resolved? I ask in a spirit of charity, not with some kind of triumphalism. I am genuinely curious and it has been a major barrier to ever considering the claims of the East has being *true* insofar as it makes that claim to the exclusion of the West.",OrthodoxChristianity

Mission Trips that aren't specifically Orthodox,TimeLadyJ,1624638076,"When I attended a Protestant church, there was a group that would go to Haiti a couple of times a year to help support a ministry there.

I do understand the negatives with many mission trips, and I strongly feel that this one does not fit that stereotype. It is focused on job creation, education, medical, local sourcing, etc. They will hire Americans when new projects are started but once a Haitian is trained, they will hire the Haitian instead, so they aren't taking jobs from locals, they aren't doing things they are unqualified for, and importantly, they aren't evangelizing. They believe that a few basic needs must be met before someone is willing to hear the Gospel, so they focus on meeting those needs. They have helped to plant churches in areas that needed them, but these churches also have free clinics and free child &amp; adult education associated with them.

Since they don't evangelize, would it be appropriate to continue taking these trips every few years even though they aren't an Orthodox group? Obviously I would talk with my priest if we began to strongly consider an upcoming trip.",OrthodoxChristianity

Questions regarding freedom of Religion from a Muslim,questions2christians,1624624576,"Hi,

I have tried to post this message on r/Catholicism but in vain because I don't have enough karma to post there. I know the two churches are separated however I would to know if what I wrote applies to the Orthodox Church and if so how ?

What's the Orthodox Church's policy (or policies) on freedom of religion ? 

I am using a throwaway account. While being a Muslim I listen to virtually every conference, lecture of Christians (including some Catholics) who criticize Islam from both a theological and political point of view. That's a weird hobby I know but I am a rather curious person and I really want to get to know the other side better.

However there is something that really puzzle me. I understand when Catholics criticize Islam for things that are in contradiction with Catholic teachings, I don't agree with them but yet I understand where they are coming from. But when Catholics criticize Islam on the law of apostasy (death penalty for someone who leave Islam in a Muslim state), I don't really get it.

I know apostates and heretics are not the same concepts, however I learned that the Catholic Church used to order the killing of heretics (those who publicly proclaimed heretical teachings and did not retract after some kind of grace period). It is not exactly the same as killing someone who leave Catholicism, the analogy with Islam isn't perfect however to an outsider it is kinda the same as both in Islam and Catholicism the ones (heretic or apostate) that don't go public are not to be executed by the State.

When I shared this issue with some practicing Catholics friends I got those objections :

1- 'The all inquisition thing is overblown by the mass media, anti-Christian establishment'. I agree and I think the inquisition did not killed as many as we might think however I was not pointing to the inquisition but rather to the general practice of 'persecuting' vocals heretics. I also don't believe that the Catholic Church actually ordered forced conversions, I have read parts of the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas and he clearly said non-Catholics were not to be forced into the Faith (while it was a different matter for those who already accepted the Faith).

2- 'The Church did not executed heretics it was actually the political powers (states, kingdoms, etc) who did it to maintain stability and peace in the land'. While technically true the Church still insisted on ordering the state to execute heretics (see the Fourth Council of the Lateran).

3- 'What the Church said on executing heretics was a pastoral matter not a doctrinal one, which means the Church was not bound to those former decisions on this matter and we got Dignitatis Humanae now anyway' while I understand that the Church moved on on this issue with Vatican II and that it wasn't a matter of faith where the Church would make no mistake, however I am like : How come centuries of theologians such as St Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Innocent III, Gregory XVI did not see freedom of religion as almost self-evident as Catholics do see it today ? Many Catholics today would see such limitation on public expression of religion not only as outdated but also immoral.

So here are my questions :

1- How come Catholics could have been so wrong for so long on that issue from Augustine to Gregory XVI ?

2- How can Catholics who criticize Islam morally on freedom of religion (specifically on the law of apostasy) still be coherent with the Church's theological justifications for persecuting heretics (see St Augustine use of Luke 14:23) ? I am not talking about Catholics who are saying 'Islam is outdated on this, the Church did move on' but folks who says that limiting freedom of religion and 'freedom of error' is purely evil.

3- How do you respond to those who say there is a contradiction between Vatican II and pre-Vatican II on freedom of religion ?

What bother me this most isn't the historical aspects of it, but rather the theological aspect of it, centuries of theologians finding justification to such practices both in scriptures and what is holy tradition to Catholics.

Catholics were not the only ones for that matter, Martin Luther and John Calvin were also in favour of persecuting heretics as were most of the theologians of their time (both Protestants and Catholics).

Really sorry for those questions, my intent is not to start a debate on Islam, but rather to understand Catholicism. I genuinely want to understand this issue.

Do I have to believe all church doctrine?,Galconite,1624592024,"Hi, I'm a Christian coming from a protestant background. I want to start going back to church and I have been considering joining the orthodox church. I want to worship God the way Christians have historically worshiped.  I also want Christians across the world to be unified and share communion together. From that perspective, it would make sense for everyone to join the original church.

I know I could attend services, but I desperately want to partake in the Eucharist.  But what if I go through catechesis and I don't agree with all the church's teachings?  Would I still be able to receive the bread and wine?

I agree with the Nicene creed and generally agree with the church's teachings on salvation.  I enjoy the tendency to refrain from defining everything and accept that our religion is filled with ""mysteries.""  But I don't agree with some other beliefs and practices.  I don't believe that the bread and wine are literally the body and blood of Christ.  When I eat them at church, I think about them as if they are him, and I remember his sacrifice.  Would this disqualify me?

I would also be uncomfortable venerating icons and praying to saints.  I am open to the possibility that these practices are good , but I don't get the impression from the New Testament and early writings that the first Christians did these things, particularly icon veneration.  If icon veneration is acceptable worship, then I imagine I would abstain from it the way some early Christians abstained from eating meat.  Paul said that people whose ""weak"" faith does not allow them to eat meat should not be judged, for God has accepted them.  Similarly, I should hope to be able to partake of the Eucharist even if I am uncomfortable with some Orthodox practices.  Would I be accepted?",OrthodoxChristianity

What does prayer for the dead actually do? Is it really that different from purgatory?,chuuka-densetsu,1624470043,"My simple understanding of purgatory is that a person who makes a good confession before death will be locked in a spiritual prison, suffering torments to cleanse of the effects and penalties of sin. I think that Orthodox do not like this doctrine because (1) it's not in the old traditions, and (2) it sort of denies free will, forcing someone into a prison rather than giving them the choice of true repentance, and (3) it separates sin into two portions, one as a debt which must be paid and the other as an evil which stains the soul. 

But if this is really the case, how do we actually have prayer for the dead in a way that respects free will? My understanding of the ladder of divine ascent or aerial tollhouses is that a person truly needs to struggle to attain a seat in paradise using free will alone. For example, demons may tempt you but you need to really resist and then you will be saved. So how does the prayer for dead and intercession of saints help?

Sometimes I fantasize about starting my own orthodox christian nation in antarctica.,Xboriken1171,1624337682,"I'm a catechumen for the oriental orthodox church (Coptic orthodoxy) and from time and time again I have these dreams or fantasies of mine that I wish I and a wife of mine and kids of mine and few others who are orthodox christian and come with me and could escape the moral decadence of the west and settle into an unclaimed land somewhere, such as mary byrd in antarctica and establishing a tsarist type orthodox monarchy. If it did come to this and this colony in mary byrd succeeds, I would like this nation I created to not only be an example to the world of being a rightous orthodox christian civilization based on love, compassion, peacemaking, and wholesomeness but also an example of being a fair and just nation where no man is wronged or judged just because he or she broke some stupid outrageous social morres in western civilization or in muslim countries that isolates them socially from everyone's social circles.

The reason I am making this post on this subreddit is because as a person who has asperger's and has difficulty picking up social ques and difficulty trying to follow basic social morres in western society, I feel that among orthodox christians, primarily ones from countries like russia and Serbia and ethiopia, they don't seem to expect those same morres from me because they grew up with different cultural morres than in the west so I can be myself (I like to think of myself that I am very socially approachable and pleasant to be around in social circles and I watch what I say and keep conversations in a good vibe and not make any akward moments). 

With the moral decline going on in the westernized nations and the feeling of wholesomeness being withered away, I would think that being able to start a nation and having soveriegn land to work, make use of and build a society based on things that make nation's and cultures last for generations. I fear that if the west continues to go down its current path of its toxic capitalist and moral decline that it could become just like what sodom and gomorrah or pagan rome was or even worse, and then they wan to spread these ideas to other civilizations that never asked for them like russia or china, and I'm seeing roman catholcism and protestantism even slowly falling into that.",OrthodoxChristianity

Catholic feeling a call to questions,Black0tter1,1624326507,"Hello! I have been around here for a while now and I've been reading a lot of the posts on here and I felt that today was the day I am supposed to ask questions, poke around, and see what's what. 

My story: I was raised Catholic and sent to a very traditional Catholic private school (Opus Dei if you know what that is, its not what has been represented in Angels &amp; Demons or the Da Vinci Code at all). I've had questions about the Incarnation, Papal Infallibility and transsubstansiation among other things. When I asked questions about these issues I felt lost and couldn't understand what was being explained to me. 

So where does my interest/question about Orthodoxy come in? In my senior year of high school I was given the opportunity to go to Greece for two and a half weeks. My schedule was such that I couldn't attend the Catholic/Melkite church that was there, So I went to a Greek Orthodox Church and felt something (i don't know how or what to describe it) that has never left me and I haven't felt since. I'm not sure which church it was but it was near the Catholic church i was trying to go to Mass to (St. Dionysius the Areopagate). I loved the service (i think that's what its called. it was around sunset) . Everything about it was beautiful: the people, the Church, the chant, everything. 

TL/DR:

I'm a Catholic who was deeply affected by my visit to Greece and felt something that I can't describe and haven't felt since. Ever since going to that service( Mass? idk what to call it), the questions I've had about the Catholic faith haven't gone away and have only multiplied.

2.	‚Å†They have abandoned in recent decades the Apostolic teaching regarding non-abortive contraception.
3.	‚Å†They have inconsistent beliefs from church to church based on if Christians with valid baptisms should be re-baptized, which raises serious risk of sacrilege according Ephesians 4:5's ""one baptism"" as well as committing the heresy of Donatism that was settled long before our churches split.

Doubts about validity of reception into the Church,throwaway-ortho,1624298403,"Using a throwaway because I feel too shy to discuss on my main.

&amp;#x200B;

I was received into the Church recently through baptism + chrismation, but I've felt increasing discomfort. Basically, I have doubts over if my baptism is valid (the chrismation itself was valid), over three factors

&amp;#x200B;

1) my immersion was not full (the water was a bit shallow, the priest poured water on the uncovered part of my head) - this one isn't a major issue but it still bothers me a bit

&amp;#x200B;

2) during the immersion the priest paused to say something in between the invocation (the immersions still occured as per canon law, three immersions), I suppose this one isn't a major issue either because there still was three immersions in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit

&amp;#x200B;

3) this one is the one that bothers me the most. Before the baptismal service I had to use the toilet, and I had some drops of urine on my clothes/leg as a result of rushing out and nervousness. I didn't think too much of it, but I think some of it was on me when I went to be baptized (in the moment I completely forgot). It was a reasonable amount in hindsight, more than a few drops. Does the baptismal water get desanctified by bodily fluids like urine and blood? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know St Nikodemos mentions sanctified water as a prerequisite of valid baptism, and I'm just worried if that was violated. 

&amp;#x200B;

This issue is basically making me feel like I'm still outside the Church and shouldn't commune until I go through the ceremony again (I know rebaptism is a heresy and I'm fairly certain the priest that baptized me wouldn't do it again), but it's giving me major anxiety and taking away the joy I should have as newly illumined. I also know I'm probably just being irrational but the anxiety is really taking its toll on me.

Filioque / Trinity question,olencrowe,1624286231,"My biggest question is, who cares?

I've struggled with the idea of the Trinity a lot. It seems like polytheism with extra steps and the filioque controversy just adds to that perception. 

What does it matter whether the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, the Son, both, or neither? If we worship only one God, doesn't that make this a moot point?

If the Holy Spirit is God, how can it proceed from itself? If Jesus is God why did he ask himself why he forsook himself when he died on the cross? Wouldn't he know the answer?

I was a Christian for the first twenty or so years of life and just believed because that's what I have been taught. Now that I have come back to Christianity I am finding these things a lot harder to digest. Arguing over the filioque doesn't seem like something true monotheists should be doing.

Large print prayer book and other ?'s regarding older convert,Jjohns28,1624250077,"My elderly mom is converting. (Yay!) 

I am wondering if there's a prayer book that would make a good gift for her. Not the Jordanville... I was going to get a Pocket Prayer Book for Orthodox Christians. It's the right size as prayer books go, not intimidating, no overly lengthy prayers, but the print is really tiny. I can't remember if the OSB-NT&amp;Ps is large print, and whether it contains morning and evening prayers. 

Also, would a prayer rope be an appropriate gift? I always have had trouble with the traditional kind on which the knots generally are way too close together. I know an older person with arthritis might find it hard too. Maybe a small chotki with 30/33 beads? (Again, the point is not to overwhelm. My mom is 74 and has major health problems, worked blue collar jobs all her life, and isn't theologically savvy.) 

Mostly, can you please pray for her? We're working on getting her received by next month, as she told me after vespers this weekend she said a sure she wants in. Mom had two strokes earlier this year, and expressed her wish to be Orthodox in the hospital. That was four months ago, and I've been increasingly eager to get this show on the road, and am trying to understand/respect the priest's perspective that this shouldn't be rushed, which to be honest has perplexed and frustrated me given the medical issues involved. He's one of the best and wisest priests I've known, so he has his reasons without a doubt.

Rev 22:1,Vasilisonofspiro,1624245347,"I‚Äôve read a lot of debates regarding the Filioque and have always been thoroughly convinced of the Orthodox position ( St Maximus the confessor is particularly damning ). I know most of the common Roman prooftexts and responses, yet recently I came upon a new biblical prooftext Rev 22:1. 

‚ÄúThen the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb‚Äù 

This seems like an almost silver bullet for the Filioque position as the river of life ( which in patristic exegesis is the spirit) proceeds from the throne of both the Father and Son, which is the Latin position that the spirit gets its essence from a single spiration of the father and son. I looked at the Greek and proceeds is ŒµŒ∫œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ which denotes procession in regards to essence. 

Now naturally I turned to the fathers to see how they interpreted this but I‚Äôve found nothing ( no commentaries or anything). Even the OSB is silent on the issue. Now there must be a simple explanation as I doubt if a text was such a silver bullet as I think it is it would be ignored by most theologians. Most Catholics ignore and go straight to the spirit of the son prooftext ( which is much weaker).

"I am a sad, broken man [LONG overdue update]",NocturnalPatrolAlpha,1624240222,"[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/in77xa/i_am_a_sad_broken_man_please_help_me_how_can_i/)

[First update](https://old.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/iy9bop/i_am_a_sad_broken_man_update/)

After pouring my heart out on here, and asking you all for prayers, I felt you deserved to get a follow-up.

So, not long after I shared the first update, maybe a month or two, things got bad again. And it was pretty bad. Thanks to some of the heterodox teachings I was raised with, I think I can say that there will in all likelihood never come a time in which I am in danger of contemplating suicide, no matter how bad things get, but this was unique in that I was in such a low place that I preferred being asleep to being awake.

The waking world had become a nightmare, and sleep was my only escape. It was the only time of day I got to *wake up* from the seemingly never-ending nightmare. I was going to sleep as early as possible, and getting up as late as my schedule would allow. Every day was a battle just to put one foot in front of the other, and get through the day so I could go back to sleep.

I didn't want to die, but I wanted to be in a coma. A restful coma, with pleasant dreams, soft cool pillows, plenty of linens, and no worries.

Since this was impossible, I had to make do with 8 or 9 hours of sleep a day. Ideally, though, I just wanted to stop worrying. But the deterioration of the socio-political climate in my country is like a positive feedback loop; it's exponential, unstoppable, and irreversible. Eventually I couldn't escape the fact that things are not going to get better any time soon, probably not in my lifetime.

Now I won't say the next thing that happened is I had a eureka moment. I don't think clearly when I am in a pit of despair. I am certain it was one of the saints, or my guardian angel, or the Theotokos herself, who brought it to my attention.

After *months* of prayer, a thought came into my head. With the overwhelming feeling that I was finally thinking clearly, I sent an email to my priest, asking to sit down and talk as soon as possible, and that I may have figured out what's actually wrong with me.

We met the next day, and I told him that I was convinced I had experienced trauma as a child and later young adult, and I was suffering from PTSD.

First, I was raised Calvinist, with a particularly graphic emphasis on wrath, judgment, and damnation. Second, not only was I raised Calvinist, my family were followers of Harold Camping and the old Family Radio empire. The much publicized 2011 end times prediction was the number one most bone-crunchingly *TERRIFYING* ordeal of my entire life, but that was merely the culmination of a slow-burning dread that had been building since 2001.

There is no doubt in my mind that that experience traumatized me, because I become intensely fearful and depressed at the mere prospect of massive life changes for the worse. Thinking too deeply about the passage of time, people growing older, and the things I missed out on, causes *profound* grief. I believe it is because, on a psychological level, I am still *terrified* of ""the end of the world."" The most horrific nightmares I've ever had were all about the end of the world.

I talked to my priest about all this, did the best I could to let it all out. We had limited time to talk, because he had a parish council meeting, so our discussion was relatively brief. I barely remember what all was said. What I do remember is the difference. I walked into the church building *stricken* by anxiety. Thoughts racing through my head, my heart thumping, I was fighting to keep from hyper-ventilating, just a mess.

And I walked out almost completely at peace. The turbulent waters of anxiety were calmed. I wasn't paralyzed with fear over the future anymore. I slept soundly that night, and I didn't feel my blood turn to ice when I awoke the next morning. The *worry* had been taken away.

That was in January. Aside from the spook of a momentary gas shortage last month, I've been basically fine ever since. There are still some things that I have to work through, like bitterness and resentfulness. I have a HUGE mental block that makes forgiveness extremely difficult, and I *flinch* whenever I read the passage in the sermon on the mount where Jesus says to turn the other cheek. I'm almost positive I know what's causing this mental block, but the courage to talk to my priest about it is something else I'm working on, because due to certain experiences, I don't trust anybody to take me seriously. It's something I've lost FB friends over, and I once very nearly got into a screaming match with two of my brothers about it. I'm not going to say what it is.

In spite of that, overall, I am doing much, much better. Being able to focus on what is right in front of me, and letting God worry about worldly affairs, is tremendously freeing. Leaving the things I can't control up to God honestly feels like a superpower, because due to the ordeals with Calvinism and Harold Camping, it was the things I couldn't control that caused me the *most* anxiety. That feeling of helplessness. Now that's almost all gone.

It's as if Jesus rebuked the emotional turmoil that tormented me for so many years, saying ""Peace! Be still!""",OrthodoxChristianity

"Orthodox mystical focus and ""New Age""",HipnotistaDeEsquina,1624160001,"Despite having nurtured this curiosity about Orthodoxy for many months now, I know close to nothing about how it actually works. That's mainly because there are no Orthodox churches in my area - I'm still figuring out a way to visit the closest church from me, which is a couple hundred kilometers away - But I've come across a few people online talking about a certain ""mystical"" focus of the Orthodox Church. Just now, for example, I read this comment by some guy on facebook describing how he sees the Russian Orthodox catechism:

*""A toxic melange of whipped-up New Age nonsense.""*

There's obviously a cultural conflict here. Westerners probably aren't used to certain aspects of Eastern cultures that may be present somehow in the Orthodox Church; so they tend to associate it with something they're familiar with and sounds loosely connected, which is New Age mysticism and esotericism. That's how  I see it, at least.

I would like to know more about how the Eastern Christian approach differs from what we're used to here in the West and why it seems so strange to outsiders.

- ‚Äúmaybe the Protestants are right about Sola scriptura‚Äù
- ‚Äúwhat if the orthodox converts are just decieved and Protestants did the right thing with the reformation?‚Äù

‚Ä¶etc. I know, they sound stupid right? But I‚Äôve been dealing with those thoughts for a few days and my brain was confusing me, leading me to think about Protestantism again. But the thing is, I despise evangelicalism so much. Which was the first step of me considering eastern orthodoxy. 

So then later on I saw my evangelical friend post on his Instagram story some charismatic woman who claimed to have a ‚Äúdream/vision from God‚Äù. And God spoke to her about the pre trib rapture and stuff. Of course I panicked. God also ‚Äútold her‚Äù that people that suffer my specific medical condition (not specifying) are apparently ‚Äúruining bloodlines‚Äù and stuff. So this made me panic.

In the midst of my panic, I felt my heart cry out. It‚Äôs like my heart wanted to talk to a saint or cry out to a saint because my head was (uncontrollably) filled with blasphemous thoughts about God.  Today I had the desire for the first time, to interact with saints. I also felt like crying, like a push towards Eastern Orthodoxy again.

In Orthodoxy it is believed that a Christian must confess his/her sins by attending the sacrament of confession.

That comes from the tradition of orthodox church but also (i think) from a Bible verse that it is believed that Jesus gave to his disciples the power to forgive sins. He said that those sins they forgive are forgiven but those who are retained are retained.


So, tradition plus interpretation of that verse (maybe there are other verses too), made Orthodoxy to believe that a Christian must attend the sacrament of Confession.

Between Orthodoxy and Catholicism,sailrjerry,1624068073,"Hi everyone!

Just to give a bit of a backstory, I grew up Protestant, raised in the AoG/non-denominational church. I‚Äôve become very disillusioned with and burned out on Protestantism, and also as a result of studying early church history as well as the reformers (at a Protestant Bible college no less!) I‚Äôve decided that I can no longer be a Protestant. So that leaves me two choices: Catholicism or Orthodoxy. I really like the intellectual tradition of the Catholic Church, but I don‚Äôt like some of their doctrines, like purgatory or papal infallibility, just to name a couple. And on the Orthodox side, I like the mysticism and relative simplicity of it (such as the fact that there isn‚Äôt a distinction between mortal and venial sins). That being said, it‚Äôs really important to me to have good reasons to reject the papacy. To anyone that has been on my path, why did you reject the Catholic Church? What are some compelling reasons that the papacy isn‚Äôt biblical or valid?

Edit: I should also say that I also don‚Äôt want to make my decision based on personal preference. I want to make my decision based on truth, even if it‚Äôs uncomfortable. I know that posting this question in an orthodox forum doesn‚Äôt fit the mold of objectivity (why learn about the Navy SEALs from a MARSOC warrior when I can go talk to one?) but Catholic apologetics seems to bend the truth a bit when it comes to church history.

In the city I moved to in Romania, they have a priest unofficially in charge of helping foreigners with confession and all that.

If you walk in off the street, unless you know the local language, they don't know who you are so it's a bit of an uphill battle to establish that you're ""in the club."" E-MAIL THE LOCAL DIOCESE so you can get someone they know on your side, making the introduction for you.

Now the question: when an Orthodox Christian goes from one country to another, and the priest in the new country wants something from that person's priest in the old country to say they're legit Orthodox, what does the priest actually say?

It's one thing if a priest needs to establish that he's legit, getting permission from the host diocese bishop to do anything other than be a private citizen visiting. I can't just go buy a cassock and call myself Fr. Whatever and be taken seriously.

I found out recently an acquaintance who I held in high regard passed last year, and I wish to commemorate him in a fashion appropriate to the orthodox faith he held so close in his life. I would like to preface the rest of my post by noting that I am not christian, and while I find orthodoxy fascinating, have little in person experience with the practices of the church. I know that amongst the catholics ( I am aware that they are rather different, but it's all that I am familiar with really to go on) it would be acceptable to light a candle at the church with a prayer for them. Is there a similar practice amongst the orthodox? If so , what would be the appropriate means of doing this, and if not, is there any other appropriate means by which I may commemorate them?

Coming Into Orthodoxy And This Forum Was One Of The Main Inspirations,EverEvolvingMind,1623852145,"Hello guys, 

I hope all is well. I just created this account but for the past couple months, I have been looking at this forum and it have given me so much inspiration to embrace Orthodoxy. It has been a slow ride so far but I really feel the change. I started saying the Jesus Prayer in April and it‚Äôs one of the greatest things I‚Äôve ever done in life because it is comforting and it‚Äôs one of the most effective ways to hold myself accountable for the things I do. 

As a child, I mostly grew up in Baptist and non-denominational churches. Both churches were the same from my experience since the churches I went to back then had what you expect of a lot of Black Churches in America. While I liked the music, I honestly never found interest in the preaching style. As a result of me not liking the way they preached, I started getting into theology around the 7th grade and my passion for this study never stopped, even when I became an atheist in the 10th grade. 

Another thing that happened in middle school was that I was slowly transforming myself into a philosopher. Whether it was on Facebook or personal notebooks, I would constantly write about what I observe in the world along with the observations of my own thoughts. In the 10th grade, I decided to study the occult from a philosophical perspective and based on what I‚Äôve read and gathered from those who practice, it‚Äôs rather silly. You are tricking your mind to accept any experience just to say you have experienced them not knowing you‚Äôre either being attacked or nothing happened at all since it was fake all along. I believe that if you are intellectually empowered and value truth, you won‚Äôt get too deep into it. 

Theology always intrigued me the most and for the past few months, questions I‚Äôve always had have been answered by reading some of Fr. Seraphim Rose‚Äôs books. Nihilism and Soul After Death have touched me the most so far. I like to have my beliefs challenged, especially when it‚Äôs concerning truth. Even for the Nihilism book - I‚Äôm against nihilism too but with some of the words he said, I had to look at myself and see I still had a little bit of nihilism in me. 

While reading these books, I stumbled upon this forum and it‚Äôs given me a lot of inspiration too because I understand the importance of iconography, honoring the saints and much more.

Thinking of converting - questioning my motives,jusub,1623795007,"Hello, all. I am currently a lifelong Roman Catholic. I have almost never wavered in my belief in God and His holy church. Now, however, I am genuinely conflicted. 

At one time, I was VERY arrogant about people who decided to leave the Church over the abuse scandals, saying that the Church is more than the sum of its sinful members, etc. For the first time, though, I am at that point, too. I am terribly ashamed of my previous attitude. 

Since the RCC acknowledges the Orthodox Church‚Äôs sacraments, I do not have an issue becoming Orthodox. I realize it‚Äôs a process - a rather intimidating one, at that - but I just can‚Äôt be a member of a Church that always covers up for and abets abusers. 

I worry about how my family will take it, though I suspect that, like me, they will be relieved that I still have access to the sacraments. 

I worry, too, about the ability to attend mass as we have a HUGE diocese here. It‚Äôs harder to miss mass here than anywhere else I‚Äôve been. There is only one Orthodox Church here, however. 

I called the outgoing priest there once, and he said he would put me in touch with the new priest. I tried calling, but no one has called me back.

Why is the Theotokos referred to as the ""salvation of the human race?"" I understand the concept of asking the Theotokos and the Saints for intercessions through prayer, and I can even get behind it and agree with it. It was explained to me by the priest that we simply ask the Saints and Theotokos to pray for us to God, and that it is no different from asking someone you know personally on Earth to pray for you. My question is: Why is this not beyond simply asking for prayer?

As title says, I'm a Catholic and I'm interested in learning a bit about the Jesus prayer and including it in my prayer life.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I've read that this prayer can be dangerous for those who pray it without any guidance. Why is that? Is it because you ""play"" with your breath? For any other reason?
2. I have no guidance regarding this practice. How should I start praying it? Is there a recommended number of repetitions for beginners? Should I just 'focus' on the words of the prayer? Should I try to 'coordinate' it with my breath at all?
3. How has this prayer brought yourself closer to God?

Greek Orthodox Church,Objective-Tea-2158,1623769643,"I attended liturgy at my home parish for the first time in about a year this past Sunday. I've been away at college, and there is a Greek Orthodox Chapel near my school, so I go there when I can. Last Summer, church was live streamed, so that is why I have not been to my home parish in a while. 

Not much has changed, obviously. There was a good amount of people, most of which not wearing masks. Very refreshing to see life getting back to normal this Summer. There is some drama regarding COVID, obviously. Most people are in agreement about church being mask-optional. The drama mostly has to do with the ""spoon debate"" for communion. My church has not transitioned to the use of multiple spoons, as many churches have. For this reason, many people are still uncomfortable taking communion. I would love to hear some opinions on this.

There is also some COVID-unrelated drama. The church I attend is Greek Orthodox, as am I. It is however, obviously open to all Eastern Orthodox cultural denominations, and all people. Usually the Lord's Prayer is read first in Greek, then in English. Last Sunday, it was read in Greek, then what I recognized to be Romanian, and then Albanian, and then English. There are a wide variety of people other than Greek people who attend liturgy at this church, and probably don't speak Greek like most of us do. I didn't think it was a big deal at all, it was literally 30 seconds of the service. 

Some people were not very happy about this, mostly older, more traditional Greeks. I don't see any real problem with it, unless I'm missing something crucial. I would love to hear of your thoughts on this matter as well.",OrthodoxChristianity

Can someone help me to understand why rejection of God is a rejection of all objective morality?,myboneschoosehanging,1623762283,"I‚Äôve read (very little and probably understood even less) about Nietzsche and his claim that if you reject God you must necessarily reject all claims of objective morality/universals, and it seems to make sense on paper.

Any other Protestant to Orthodox converts?,Outdoorswoman605,1623692320,"Hi all, I'm still very new to learning about Orthodoxy but would love to hear from other converts. Here's the story: I was raised protestant, but I'm pretty familiar with a few different denominations (baptist, wesleyan, and reformed). More recently, my husband and I were attending a reformed church and unfortunately, the RCA is splitting again. This lead me to begin asking a lot of questions and researching more church history. Long story short, I began to see some gaps in protestant theology in general, and began feeling quite lost about 6 months ago. 

This spring, I was visiting a friend in another state for a weekend and was invited to church with them. It was my first time attending an Orthodox liturgy but something about it really stood out to me. It was so beautiful and unlike any modern church service I'd ever experienced. As I kept reading more about it, I became more interested. I found a local parish and have been attending services while also still staying connected to our reformed church as I sort all this out. My main question is, if you were a former protestant turned orthodox, what was the final moment that you knew you wanted to convert? Was there a specific issue or perspective that solidified your position? How did you know when to become a catechumen?

I'd really appreciate your thoughts. This has been a very confusing, yet joyful, and a little bit scary for me over the past several months. I just want to go where God is leading me and to find a spiritual home. Thanks.",OrthodoxChristianity

The Atonement in Orthodoxy,GrillOrBeGrilled,1623676002,"Since first hearing about the Eastern Orthodox Church in high school (wow, that was almost 20 years ago), I'd heard that the Church's perspective on the death and Resurrection of Christ is what's sometimes called the ""Christus Victor"" model.

Looking again now with more age and a little wisdom, I realize that ""The Orthodox Church‚Ñ¢ believes Christus Victor"" might actually be Protestant posturing to legitimize an essentially Protestant theology--latching on to common threads between Orthodox soteriology and Christus Victor to claim that they are entirely in agreement. Case in point, the Wikipedia article on this supposedly ancient teaching begins with Lutherans in the early 1900s and ends with liberalism in the late 1900s. From what else I can tell, it's only gotten more simplistic since then.

Bojan Teodosievic over at ""Bible Illustrated"" did a wonderful video where he mentioned both the Ransom theory and Christus Victor, but without going into excessive detail on either. The video he mentioned creating at the end of that one, which would have been about why Christ had to die, regrettably hasn't dropped yet in the 9 months since.

Holy Orthodoxy always seems to defy the labels that Western Christians try to put on it, and something as important as the Atonement (specifically how it was wrought by the death and resurrection of Christ) is sure to have unfathomable depths of explanation and analogy, each with its own distinctive emphasis. Is there somewhere I could read to get a better handle, even just a high-level one, on how it all actually fits together in Orthodoxy?",OrthodoxChristianity

5  thoughts 

1. It was a lot more peaceful than I thought it would be. I felt tranquility actually, like I could just stand and absorb the orthos/liturgy without super loud annoying noises. 

2. I learned that their is a lot more icons I have to cross too, than I thought. All I did was light the candle and pray. Everyone else though went to icons and did other stuff. Felt kind of dumb. 

3.I was expecting to be preached too. But no in greek/English they didn‚Äôt preach. Or at least it didn‚Äôt feel like preaching. Very refreshing. 

4.My worries about feeling out of place is something I shouldn‚Äôt have been worried about. The Greek folk are real cool and so is the priest. Although everyone was curious why a non-greek was attending a Greek Orthodox Church. Probably because it‚Äôs a pretty rare thing I assume. The only other non Greek was a Filipino dude. 

5. There was a lot more crossing myself than I thought I‚Äôd ever have to do in my life. The whole thing felt very ancient actually.

Moving closer to baptism,flashdoc,1623607342,"I am a catechumen and my catechumate period has been one with geographic moves between states (contractor that travels). OCA jurisdiction. I have settled in well to my new church home (just been here &lt;2 months) and my priest has indicated he feels comfortable to baptize me given my preparations and extended catechism in another state. In one of our email conversations, I shared my desire to continue to meet other parishioners now that COVID precautions allowing for after service fellowship, with hopes of finding a sponsor. In a brief subsequent conversation, he states a sponsor would not technically be absolutely needed, given particulars of my situation. We were not in a situation where we could talk at greater length it yet. This was very surprising, has anyone every heard of this? Sure it is an exception from all I have read. 

Throughout this process, I have strived to follow the lead of God, the Church, my church and the priest without ""overthinking"" things as I am prone to do by personality. In this matter as well, I feel like I should follow the same principle, it *is* a result of ""talk to your priest"" and most of me feels like I am fine without a sponsor at this point (more likely than not, any sponsor I would find would just be a friendly parishioner I happen to meet at coffee hour, have fair rapport with, have the guts to ask and says yes).  To share honestly, and of course one never knows, I don't see myself as someone who would rely heavily on a sponsor, likely quite light actually (quieter type, intraverted, live a bit far from church). I can also certainly see a god parents value and role. Though nothing precludes me from finding fellow parishioners, pious individuals, over time who are sources of spiritual support and guidance.  These are my thoughts written down.  

I am leaning towards just let it unfold under direction of priest and if he is okay with it, I am too.  We will be discussing it further in next weeks.

8 coincidences and my reason of worrying. please help,RupinoSan,1623578114,"Almost a month ago, I was worrying that a man may have vanished. I started worrying that it could have been a glitch in the simulation system (if we are in one).

 I spend about 5-15 minutes trying to find ways/buildings that he may have gone to. I decided to take photos of the place in order to show the place to 2 friends and find ways/buildings that he may have gone to.

There was not any glitch in them. I was not trying to capture any evidence. They were just photos of the place. I was worrying and I took the photos in order to find an other explanation.

What if I angered Gods or the programers of the simulation? What if it counted as exposing, even though I was not trying to expose anything? I do not want to get to more details about the angering.

I have been worrying a lot about this. Some coincidences happened and I worry. what if they are bad signs?

 The coincidences:

-  1) I was going to enter a covid vaccination topic while thinking that I may read some phrases of excitement in the comments because I remembered reading phrases of excitement in an older topic.Indeed, someone wrote one of the phrases that I assumed that I may read in the newer topic. Automatically, this guess-coincidence (though expected) triggered a random thought (that I had many times in the past but for other reasons). That thought was about seeing in the username/signature of the one who posted that phrase, a word related to simulation and that it may be a bad sign from Gods or the programers. I checked the username/signature but there was no relation. I scrolled down a few comments and someone else had posted a link of a video game dlc that had the word ""simulator"" in its title. He/she posted it in order to make fun of people that are getting excited about vaccination. That game's dlc was making fun of covid stuff.

-  2) One other day, I saw in the super market a man that maybe kinda looked like the character from the video game (from the 1st coincidence) Not only that, but both were wearing circular gray hats. The video game character was wearing a typical gray, circular hat and the man in the market was wearing a gray bucket hat.

-  3) One other day, I was thinking about the man in the market a lot and the connectiong between the hats. I started thinking stuff like ""why that man had to wear that hat?(bucket hat), do people wear these hats frequently?"" and some other stuff related to it. Some seconds later, I saw in a non-busy street a man who looked like a cheap traveller, wearing a black circular feathered hat. I think it was the first tiime I was seeing that hat in my city. It was just weird that I saw him randomly in a non-busy street while thinking about a hat.

-  4) One other day, I was thinking a lot about that tourist and his hat. A lot, a lot. Almost all day. Generally, I was thinking about these coincidences very much every day. I was thinking about that tourist and his hat while randomly clicking into a random youtube video. About 5-15 seconds after the click and while thinking about the tourist, there was a quote that was saying ""thats not a good sign"". off all 18 minutes of the video, I randomly clicked to the part that about after 5-15 seconds, it has that quote?!

-  5) One time I was on my bed with my eyes closed. I started losing control of my thoughts but I did not fall asleep. Suddenly, I thought the phrase ""Œ≤œÅŒµ ŒøœÖœÉœÑ œÉœÑŒø Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒøŒªŒø"" (vre oust sto diaolo)which can be translated as ""oh go to devil (hell).hich can be translated as ""oh go to devil (hell).I do not remember why I thought that phrase. Almost a second later, I THINK I heard my brother saying it while playing an online game. I did not clearly heard his words but the melody of them sounded like ""vre oust sto diaolo"".

-  6) Today, I started thinking this coincidnece for some minutes. While thinking about that phrase, I THINK I heard a woman from outside saying something that sounded like ""diaolo"" (devil,hell). I did not hear the word clearly but I heard something like ""bla bla bla bla bla bla -aolo"" The last syllabe sounded like ""diaolo""

-  7) I was thinking about my worry and I was having random thoughts kinda like "" am I one of the unluckied people that I found myself into a situation witnessing something that may or may not be a glitch and that I experience coincidences that are possible signs from Gods?""

-  8) I was on youtube and suddenly started worrying about my problem. Suddenly, I got a random thought (that i often get) and it was kinda like ""what if when I scroll I see something related to my worry?"" and after a few scrolls there was a video that was about a graphica glitch during a weather forecast. That reminded me the reason of my worries. My worries began when I started worrying that there may have been a glitch in the simulation system.

What is the Orthodox Church‚Äôs view on jinn and ruqyahs?,redditperson77,1623562144,"I‚Äôm a Protestant, but after studying other religions I found that reading and listening to the Quran gave my body weird feelings, and I found out that Muslims believe that it is a huge sign of jinn possession.

Intercession of saints,PsychologicalPark227,1623550644,"This is one of the few Orthodox beliefs that I have any trouble with. I get the theology behind it however historically I have my doubts. 

The earliest evidence we have to asking saints for intercessions is roughly 250 ( granted there are a lot of them but still) before that there is zero mention of the practice. There is evidence of the saints being alive and praying for us but this is different then us praying for them. In addition it is not in the New Testament or in the first fathers like Ireneaus or Ignatius even when one would expect it. 

It is just an argument from silence but it‚Äôs a pretty convincing one, there are no indications of early prayers to saints. 

I seem to gravitate more to the Anglican belief that the saints pray for us and that we pray with them but that we shouldn‚Äôt address them directly.

She and her mother are liberal adventists and her father is roman catholic but looks like he's in an unhappy marriage. We watched xena, lord of the rings, the hobbit, 90s nickelodeon shows and spongebob, but they observe the sabbath and don't eat pork. She said to me years before that she doesn't want to move far from her mother and couldn't stay with me if I had a job after college with a home of my own unless we're married. 

First of all she just recently moved 3 and half hours down south of where I live from northern virginia to farmville, I was able to tolerate her religions rules when we were closer after sabbath hours, but having to drive three hours for that I couldn't bare it. 

I have shown her the unpleasant things about the seventh day adventist church has, such as not being allowed to drink alcohol or tea which she does and so does her mom, she was dating a non adventist, watching harry potter and lord of the rings. I have even shown her that the seventh day adventist church believes that instead of going to heaven you just lay on the ground until jesus comes back, she still stays in it.

There are two friend of mine who are together for a few years now and, even if they‚Äôre not engaged yet (because we‚Äôre still students in college) they‚Äôre more and more thinking about getting married later

The thing is, he is orthodox, she‚Äôs not, and both have grown in a catholic country so they don‚Äôt really know all the details of how the orthodox way is, especially for exceptional event like marriage, but they still want to, because, you know, tradition, family‚Ä¶

Recently, has been emitted the possibility I could be their witness (in fact she suggested I would be hers, because in catholic faith, there at least one witness for each, but I later discover on the internet that in the orthodox faith, there only one witness for the couple).
The thing is, I am full pagan: I am atheist, and furthermore I‚Äôm a LGBT person, and the internet told me that I can‚Äôt be witness if I‚Äôm not Christian 

Other thing is, I‚Äôve read that if the witness is in couple, their partner become witness as well 

Oh, and he‚Äôs from Bulgar origin so that would be bulgar orthodox tradition

So here are my questions:
Of all the thing I‚Äôve read, is there some mistake?

Western converts in Orthodoxy,SanctusAnglicus,1623450097,"Hi all,   


First off, apologies if this has already been discussed, I have tried to look to see if it has but I'm not the most adept at reddit and haven't been able to find anything, so sorry if this is an old topic. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I am a western Christian. I grew up Roman Catholic and am currently discerning Orthodoxy. I've read a fair few articles by converts/those who didn't end up becoming Orthodox, and one of the reasons I've seen stated multiple times is ""I am a western Christian, I didn't feel like I fit in with the eastern liturgy as it wasn't a part of my western heritage"".   


I, of course, believe that the worshipping of ones heritage is idolatry; however I can not deny there are many emotions at play when one switches from western to eastern Christianity. People might worry that they will not fit in with the eastern church, will never be accepted as truly Orthodox if you aren't eastern, will always be treated with suspicion as a westerner, feelings of betraying your heritage and ancestors who gave you your religion in the first place. 

Has anybody encountered these feelings themself? If so how did you overcome them? If you have always been Orthodox, what advice would you give to a western Christian who is considering converting, but is worried that they will just be 'larping' (for want of a better word) as an easten Christian?",OrthodoxChristianity

Does Orthodoxinfo really have a lot of schismatic authors?,athumbhat,1623447069,"I have always found orthodoxinfo to be an invaluable resource, far more detailed and thorough in its articles than the average articles on most other orthodox websites. Further, the only articles on orthodoxinfo(that I have seen) which concern the old calenderists explicitly and directly argue against them. 

In addition, I have seen in various other articles on the website not to do with the old calenderists passing negative remarks about certain aspects of schematic communion, for example an article on Saint Augustine mentioned that denial of his sainthood was a common feature of these schematic groups.

The website also does use the new calender, though they explicitly say they don't like it, even still the fact they are willing to use it does seem to prove they don't consider the use of it to place one outside the church, even though they don't like it/how it was implemented.

Now, I admit that I have not looked up the authors of each and every article, but it seems strange to me that schematics would write articles for a website that explicitly speaks out against them. In addition, I have never seen anything on the site whatsoever in favor of these groups.

From their page on the calender controversy

""Showing both calendars on this site's home page is merely **an acknowledgement that both calendars do, unfortunately, exist in the Church today.** It should in no way be seen as a tacit endorsement of the ""New"" Calendar. Many Orthodox Christians who are in New Calendar parishes lament the fact that there are two calendars. Pious Orthodox Christians who understand the effect this change has had on the Church long for the return of the New Calendar churches to the traditional calendar. In the meantime, this site‚Äîwhich has a diverse readership from Orthodox churches all over the world‚Äîwill continue to provide, as a courtesy, the Saints and readings of the day according to both calendars.""

A Brief History of the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Italy,Carter_Weinklause,1623444185,"So my family is from Sicily and Calabria, Italy.   What many of you probably do not know is that a small community of Greeks still reside in those regions, and I happen to be descended from them.   Basically, I am like Tony Bennett (he is Greek-Italian) but not as old (haha).  

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to talk about the history of the Orthodox Church in Italy, it's history and the attempted revival some Greeks are trying to establish there.   

&amp;#x200B;

So we all know that we are descended from the State Church of the Roman Empire, and that Italy was the center of that Empire.   What you might not know is that in Southern Italy, there was a huge Greek Community there at that time because Sicily and Southern Italy were Greek colonies known as Magna Graecia.   This Community was visited by St. Peter and by St. Paul, St. Peter ordained Syracuse's first Bishop, and St. Paul preached there on his way to Rome.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first several hundred years of the Church's history,  the Italo-Greek Church was under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Rome.  In the late eight century, it was transferred to Constantinople's jurisdiction.    

[The Byzantine Empire in 717 AD](https://preview.redd.it/70be5wlu1p471.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4784d0663a3dcb205437b121dbc439cb26c68e62)

[Italy Before the Normans came and Slaughtered Orthodox Christians](https://preview.redd.it/donk8spn1p471.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f579417258d69ed1ec7874f893cf60922cd137c6)

Well, the Pope didn't really much like the fact that Apulia was part of the Byzantine Empire, so he encouraged the Normans to help the Lombard majority in Apulia overthrow the Byzantines.   It is important to note that there is still a pretty significant Greek Community in Apulia of  54,278 people today.   Greeks were just in the minority there, and the Pope made sure Greek Christians were slaughtered and forced to convert to the Roman Church.

&amp;#x200B;

The Norman tactics were to seize or build small fortifications and use it to terrorise the Greeks of Italy.  All of this had the backing of the Pope.   

&amp;#x200B;

However, even after the fall of Italy to the Normans, and then the subsequent Turkish invasion of Anatolia,  the Greek Community survived in Southern Italy, and Orthodoxy was often practiced in secret.

&amp;#x200B;

The ranks of Greeks were refreshed constantly after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 by Greeks fleeing their rule.   They enabled the Greek community there to survive, and there are several Greek villages in Calabria and Apulia, one in Sicily, and enclaves in Sicilian Cities like Messina and cities in Calabria and Apulia.   

&amp;#x200B;

Greek Christians in Southern Italy survived, and today they are experiencing a small revival, with communities of Greeks in Southern Italy such as  Gallician√≤ ( ŒìŒ±·∏ç·∏çŒπ—úŒπŒ±ŒΩœå ) building a small Orthodox Church in the year I was born, 1999.   It was built by renovating a stone house in the upper part of town, and represents the testimony in a renewed ecumenical climate of Orthodox Pilgrims to Greek worship sites in Southern Italy.   Moreover, a small community of Greek Orthodox monks was re-established after centuries.   

&amp;#x200B;

1) The Confession of St. Peter Mogila- literally recommended by 4 out of 5 patriarchs. 

2) The Heavenly Banquet- book designed to thoroughly explain the Divine Liturgy.

3) A Psalter for prayer- Includes instruction for prayer prior to reading the psalms.

4) The small red Antiochian prayer book- small, inexpensive, fits in a pocket.

5) The Rudder- Compilation of Cannons with commentary from St. Nicodemus of the Holy Mountain. 

6) The Ladder of Divine Ascent- Supposedly monks read this every year during lent.

"What are your beliefs on Homosexuality? As a gay man, can I love God?",Carter_Weinklause,1623301220,"So I have wanted to be Orthodox for a long time.   It started in High School when I was researching the Byzantine Empire whose values as the Christian Rome, the true Rome in my mind, spurred endless imagination.   I spent dozens of hours in study hall imagining a World where Constantinople never fell.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to University and my grandmother got her DNA results back and it turns out she is an ethnic Greek.   My family is from Southern Italy, and upon doing research I found out most Italians from Sicily, Calabria, and Apulia are ethnic Greeks, and there is still a Greek community there that speaks Greek.   I also learned that the Orthodox Church is attempting a revival there.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my love affair of Roman history spurred me to embrace that part of me, and for the past 2 years I was Orthodox in thought &amp; practice if not in name.   

&amp;#x200B;

You might find it weird that my path to faith was through history and heritage, not rigorous study in theology.   However, in some ways this makes perfect sense, the Greeks of Southern Italy are mostly Catholic today because of the horrible atrocities that the Latin Church has done to us for the past 800 or so years.   I am reclaiming a part of me that was lost, and a part my ancestors were denied.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I have always been a pretty devout Christian, praying 6-12 times a day since I was in High School, and on a bad day, much more.   I listen to Orthodox music on my walks, and feel devout while doing so.   I try my best every day to be 100% pure of heart because I know that if I do it just to get into the Kingdom of Heaven, I won't get there.   So I try my best to be good, and to be really good, for goodness's sake.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes when I commit a sin or need to reflect on God, I lock myself in a dark room and pray.   Faith is what allowed me to survive High School, faith in Jesus.

&amp;#x200B;

My young adult, teenage and late childhood years were filled with abusive parents, bullies, the fear of death, and constant loneliness.   The one thing that got me through was my faith.  I wore a ring with a cross on it every day to school, to show my faith in God.   I prayed everyday for people who hated me.   I prayed even for my father who was cruel to me because I was born with Autism and he never really wanted me as a son.

&amp;#x200B;

My Dad had abandoned God when I was a kid, he went from someone who at least said he believed, to someone who didn't, because his new wife was an Atheist as well as a wicked person.   I prayed for him and for that he threatened to beat me, but I kept praying for him, and asking God to forgive him.

&amp;#x200B;

My Dad left me with enormous anxiety, which my faith let me handle when I was in University.   I prayed to God and asked him to carry some of the weight, and he did so willingly.   I was grateful, even more so than the time when I wanted to die and I swear to this day he came to me and told me to press on.   

&amp;#x200B;

If I ever had any doubt in my mind that God existed, it vanished that one fateful night when I was 17.   However, it has returned in recent years because like all mortals I am flawed and lack true faith.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to University, at University I prayed often, and was drawn to religious people, while still trying to decide which faith to practice.  I was torn between Anglicanism, Latin Catholicism and Orthodoxy.   We all know in the end, which one I choose.  Whatever Church I choose, it had to at least have Roman elements in it, and claim to be the Universal Church, which all 3 do.

&amp;#x200B;

When I left University for the past two years due to stress, I met fellow Christians online, and we talked about the Bible, God and faith together.   One of my best friend's Rachel, told me that she wasn't sure what she thought about gay people but after talking to me, she was sure it wasn't a sin, for I am more faithful than anyone she has ever met.   To that I say, I try my best.

&amp;#x200B;

So would you condemn me personally, if I joined a Parish that was more accepting of LGBTQ people and tried to live my life in the best Christian way possible?   Would you condemn me if I tried my hardest to stamp out atheism and devil worship in the gay community which I see as the tragic consequence of our interpretations of scripture.

One thing that draws me back to Orthodoxy is that at the end of the day I understand it really to be about about love and healing divisions, and just suspending judgement and extending kindness, and while there are notions of sin, they're about pitfalls towards personal theosis rather than looking to mark anyone else's scorecard. (Given that I'm not gay, for example, I really don't think ""sodomy"" is any of my concern, and I'd rather love my gay brothers and sisters than fixate on what they do or don't do.)

In my journey, I've been trying to educate myself somewhat through online sources, but reflecting on points raised in recent discussions here, I find that a lot of those sources come from ex-Evangelicals who span a spectrum from pretty middle of the road to angry culture warriors, and I worry that I'm feeding myself a diet that is at best overly literal and at worst toxic and likely to lead me to eventually drop the whole thing.

Is a Christian's life difficult?,Tirogalo,1623256946,"


I do not know how a Christian should live. I read from an Orthodox Christian (and I do not think he is the only one) that we need to participate in rituals and sacraments of the church and that many things can be considered a sin. I think he even stated that seeing an ice-cream and wanting to eat is temptation.

That christian also said that we need to have a strict monk  that will guide us and that he needs to insults when we sin in order to be humbled. I think he also said that we need to do what the monk will order us and that if the monk commands suicide we must suicide. He also said that a monk ordered a sinner to commit suicide and he was ready to do it but the monk canceled the command.



I also read about a monk who rejected a gift of bed sheets because they had flowers and he considered them too prideful.

He says that that these are not words of his own but words of fathers of the church.

The commentary is constantly trying to reassure me that the body is good, but it's fallen, and that humans aren't inherently evil, they are just tainted by sin, etc. But this all seems like a giant coping mechanism because if you read what Paul is actually saying without the commentary enabled, it just seems like he hates the body and he hates the flesh. It all seems to support the gnostic ideology at least at the surface level.

I understand why Orthodox (and Catholic) teaching supports the goodness of the body, since it's necessary for our metaphysics to actually make sense, but how do you reconcile it with what Paul was saying?

Issues with the Orthodox Church - an exercise in humility,FVWHAlpha,1623245250,"I'd like to ask everyone here what they think of the state of the Orthodox Church in 2021 and simply ask what do they think the biggest issues are present within the church. This is mainly because I find it's helpful to remind ourselves that we have issues that need sorted and the tendency to bury heads in the sand that the church sometimes is something we should challenge in these especially troubling times for the church. This isn't some kind of personal attack on my own Church of course, this is merely me wishing to be honest with what I see, these things don't actually change my belief that this is the Church that Christ founded. 

My biggest issues:
1. Lack of a proper method of creating universal statements, a council of the primates should be convening at least a 3 times per year to keep the churches working together.
2. A lack of clarification over what the prerogatives of the Ecumenical Patriarch are. Is the EP the head of the church? First among equals? Just a Bishop? What are the specific powers that are invested? Unclear.
3. A lack of a united Catechism of the Orthodox Catholic Church. This may he a controversial opinion to say the least, but we need to be teaching the exact same faith to each Orthodox Christian I feel this is a huge issue and should seriously be sorted soon. Even if we took St Philarets Longer Catechism as made it universally taught that would go a long way to fixing this.
4. Lack of single canonical churches in the West where needed and a lack of a specific council to decide who should set up where etc. This is huge in places like the US and the UK (though to a lesser extent in the UK) and has so many jurisdictions overlapping with Bishops on Bishops when they should be serving elsewhere.
5. Somewhat linked to this last point but Nationalism within the churches. Too often are the Orthodox seen as a host of cultural clubs (mind I don't entirely believe this is the case). There are still issues with this today, such as having a specific Diocese for one Ethnic group (OCA I'm looking at you) etc it only entrenches the church into these lines and harms us as a whole. 
6. This isn't a point, rather just saying that we should all pray for the unity of the church and place ourselves in the trust of God that the fallible men that run the church will be able to see the issues plaguing us.
7. Not enough seminaries just as whole but particularly in the West. The Catholics absolutely have us beat here, one Seminary in a diocese is just an excellent idea and honestly should be how we function period. The US only has I believe 17 in total (including 4 distance based learning ones).

I almost lost my faith completely,Tirogalo,1623241458,"I just want to get it off my chest. I struggle with faith.

So, people without faith are going to suffer in hell eternally for something that it is natural (at least to me) to not have?

That plus there are other religions in which people would claim that theirs is the right one. So, why I have to reject all other religions/traditions and accept Christianity?

I am not rejecting Christianity completely but I am just being honest. I cant have faith. I try to follow Jesus from fear but I am like ""maybe Jesus is real, maybe not""

Message from a Roman Catholic,MinnesotaNice_07,1623219045,"Hello everyone!

While I am not an Orthodox Christian, I just wanted to thank you guys. In some of my experiences with Protestants who declared that Catholics are not Christians, I have had support from some Orthodox Christians. Furthermore, one of the main thinkers that helped bring me back to following Christ was an Orthodox Christian! Dostoevsky, in case anyone was wondering.

Truthfully, I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for my Orthodox brothers and sisters, despite the fact that I don‚Äôt actually know any in person. Truthfully, I would love to meet some and experience an Orthodox service, to see what it‚Äôs like and if there are similarities between it and a Catholic mass.

I don‚Äôt know if this is a controversial thing to say, but I wish that Catholics and Orthodox Christians could reunite again. I see many more similarities with you guys than I do with many Protestants I know, and when I think about it... you guys almost feel like long lost brothers and sisters in the faith, and I wish that we could be one again.

But regardless... God bless you guys! üôÇ",OrthodoxChristianity

This is my first post in this subreddit, and I just had a question regarding popular Christian music &amp; Orthodoxy.

I have a lot of opinions on Christian music as a whole and whether or not it should be used in liturgy (spoiler alert, I take an Orthodox stance on the matter, one of the reasons I fell in love with the Eastern Orthodox and even the Eastern Catholics is because you both use the traditional chants. Not the whole ‚ÄúYes Lord,‚Äù ‚ÄúHere I am Lord,‚Äù etc. stuff) but is the genre primarily sola Protestant or are their Orthodox singers who are renowned in the genre?

So, I am tired of dealing with this sin as you can see in the title. I‚Äôm exhausted and tired of crying to my Father for forgiveness always, only to fall back AGAIN.

I believe God would want me to seek counsel from my brethren on Reddit.

I don‚Äôt know how to stop. I could do my best to think about godly and good things like St. Paul teaches us in Philippians 4 but it‚Äôs hard, and secondly I barely know what to think of.

I only feel bad about them AFTER I‚Äôve sinned, which sucks and is offensive to God, I know. 

I don‚Äôt have thoughts of fornication, because I‚Äôm well grounded in my values and know that fornication/premarital sex is a big no-no. But I imagine married life with her and think about railing her as if we‚Äôre married and stuff. It‚Äôs stupid, I know. Idk if it‚Äôs just my teenage hormones (I‚Äôm 18) or Satan is screwing around with me these days - or maybe it‚Äôs both! I‚Äôm horny at the worst times, and this wasn‚Äôt really an issue 2-3 months ago. This has been bothering me for a month or so now.

Is this divination from God or a deceptive spirit?,AlyAnder4,1623188647,"A few years ago, there was an ""incident"" in my family which changed a lot of peoples' lives. It was extremely unfortunate and upsetting (not disease related)

I slowly started to develop a fear of said thing happening to me in the future. I thought about it a lot and looked online to see if others had experienced the same. After a while, I started asking God to show me signs indicating if said thing would happen or not. I was expecting a positive response, however I got the complete opposite. All of these signs were indicating that I will indeed experience said thing in the future. I fell into a deep depression and my relationship with God worsened. I couldn't believe that He had doomed me to such a terrible fate.

After consulting some people, they came to the conclusion that these signs were not from God as they are not of His character and it is probably the enemy trying to lead me astray.

However, I still have some questions.

If these are truly not from God...
Then how could these signs be so exact and precise? Whenever I asked for God to show me a sign, I did it in my head. How could it be from the enemy if demons do not know how to read minds?

And
If these are truly from God...
1. Why is He doing this to me?
2. Why does He only choose to sometimes give me signs and sometimes not?
3. Why does He not answer my prayers when I ask for confirmation? I have asked God several times to confirm if the signs were from Him, yet to no avail. If He can show me signs, why won't he answer my prayers?

This has been going on for a while and it still causes me great anxiety and dread. I have prayed about it many times yet I have not received a positive answer.

Question about Trinity,radonezh,1623183339,"&gt;(We believe) in one Father, the beginning , and cause of all: begotten of no one: without cause or generation; 

&gt;And in one Son of God, the Only-begotten, our Lord, Jesus Christ: begotten of the Father, before all the ages

&gt;and when we say He was before all the ages we show that His birth is without time or beginning: for the Son of God was not brought into being out of nothing

&gt;For there never was a time when the Father was and the Son was not, but always the Father and always the Son, Who was begotten of Him, existed together. 


And he said:

&gt;The Father is one Father, and without beginning, that is, without cause: for He is not derived from anything. The Son is one Son, but not without beginning, that is, not without cause: for He is derived from the Father. But if you eliminate the idea of a beginning from time, He is also without beginning: for the creator of times cannot be subject to time.

For a property is quite constant. For how could a property persist if it were variable, moveable, and could change into something else? For if the Father is the Son, He is not strictly the Father: for there is strictly one Father. And if the Son is the Father, He is not strictly the Son: for there is strictly one Son and one Holy Spirit.

"I am getting pissed with my luck and myself. If I was 10 seconds later, I probably would not have been worrying so much the last month.",Cauldronix,1623146818,"Almost  a month ago, I started worrying that I may have witnessed a glitch in  the simulation system (if in case we are in one) because it seemed to me  that a man may have vanished. There are more than 2-3 buildins/ways he may have gone to and also he may have gotten into a car.


I spend about 5-15 minutes trying to find out where he may have went.  My OCD was triggered and I was worried. I wanted to find out an other  explanation. So, I took pictures of the place in order to show the place  to 2 friends and find possible ways/buildings he may have gone. They  were just photos of the place and nothing more. There was not any glitch  in them. I was not trying to capture any evidence.


I deleted those photos some time later without showing them, because I  started worrying about a punishment from Gods or the programers. I was  worrying that maybe They/they thought that i was trying to expose  Them/them, even though I was not.


Some coincidences happened and my ocd tells me that these  coincidences may be bad signs from Gods or the programers about the  photos. Here are some of them:


1. I was going to enter a non-related topic that is about  vaccination. I remembered that in an older one, there were some exciting  people who were using phrases of excitement because of the vaccination.  I assumed that I may read some expressions of excitement in the newer  topic too. I was right and someone had wrote a phrase. Automatically, my  ocd was triggered and I got a random thought that I may see something  related to simulation in the username or signature of the one who put  that phrase and that it may be a bad sign. (in the past many times when a  small coincidence would happen, I would get an automatic thought  telling me that I may see something related to my ocd worry). I checked  the username and the signature and there was no relation. A few comments  below someone else had posted a link of a game that had the word  ""simulator"" in its title. The link was put because the game had a dlc  related to covid and it was kinda like a funny game. The link was put in  order to make fun of people who get excited because of the vaccination.


2. I was in my bed with my eyes closed and i was thinking some things  related to my ocd and some non-related. I started losing control of my  thoughts. I ended up thinking a phrase that can be translated as ""go to  hell"". Almost a second passed, and I think I heard my brother from his  room, using the same phrase in order to taunt players in his online  game. I worry because it is a phrase that we never use. I cant remember  what I was thinking before having that thought. I think I was thinking  something unrelated to my ocd but what if I was thinking something  related to my ocd and i randomly got that thought, a second before my  brother using it as a bad sign?Anyway, I have two other explanations.  Either I heard wrongly because I did not clearly heard the words but I  kinda heard the ""melody"" of that phrase. Maybe my brother was saying  something different that sounds like the ""melody"" of ""go to hell"". Or  maybe I was kinda sleeping lightly for some seconds and my brother said  that phrase, waking me up. Instead of sound, I just got the phrase as a  thought of mine (due to sleep). And then, maybe my brother repeated it  again making it look like as if we used the same phrase.


3. I was thinking about an other coincidence a lot. a lot a lot. One  time, while thinking about it, I randomly clicked a random minute of a  youtube video. About 5-10 seconds after the click, there was a quote  that was saying ""thats not a good sign""


4. I was on my bed and was thinking about other things. I think I  managed to focus on other stuff. Ocd kicked in and I started thinking  about my ocd worry. I do not remember why but I randomly got a random  thought that if I scroll down the youtube videos, I may see something  related to my ocd. I scrolled a few videos and one video was about a  graphical glitch during a weather forecast. The glitch is related to  simulation and to my ocd worry.",OrthodoxChristianity

Question about Judas and the near occasion of sin,aveotheotokos,1623123802,"Hello, I am a western rite Roman Catholic, but I also have a deep appreciation for the Eastern Church and it‚Äôs approach to the faith, so I figured I could pose this mental quandary I stumbled upon today.

I was listening to a Catholic Bible in a year podcast, and was listening to the Gospel of John and had an odd thought:  Did Jesus put Judas in the near occasion of sin?

The first moment that came to mind was when He tells Judas to go and do what he was going to do.  I rationalized that at that point, Jesus knew that nothing He would say would change Judas' mind at that point, so He was not tempting him to sin since Judas had already made his decision.

The second moment though I have not yet found a way to explain away this thought.  If Jesus knew that Judas would betray Him, yet chose Him as a disciple anyways, was Jesus putting Judas on the near occasion of sin?  If He had not chosen Judas, Judas would not have been in the position to betray His location and identify Him to authorities.  By still choosing Judas while knowing that doing so would set him on a trajectory to fall into a serious sin, it would appear that Jesus was deliberately acting in a way and making choices that would directly place Judas on a trajectory towards sin.

The Church has so many Saints and great writings that I assume someone has come across this mental quandary before and found a rational explanation, but I have not found anything yet.  I know in my heart that Jesus could not have been doing something wrong here, but yet I feel that there should be a logical and well reasoned explanation for why this idea is incorrect.",OrthodoxChristianity

Orthodox values are most often not a part of Western values, Orthodox peoples are not Western peoples, and so on. You know what I mean.

What do you make of this term, or terms? What is the West? What are Western values? Why are the Orthodox excluded?

Does the term Western civilization make sense the way it is defined? I am asking this because, as I said, the definition of ""the West"" excludes the Orthodox, but very explicitly includes the Jews, Jewish culture, Judaism and so on.

Struggling to understand the soteriological differences between Catholicism and Orthodoxy,AggieMemeLord,1623056863,"Howdy, 

I‚Äôm sure some variation of this question  is given to you all fairly often. Forgive me for that. To give some brief background I am essentially Reformed Protestant (Presbyterian), with a Baptist background. This is important because my soteriological disposition is towards grace more than work first and foremost. 

However, mainly due to great influence from both loving and intelligent Catholics (and one Orthodox who makes his case for the East) I have begun to really drift from my Protestant roots. I have come to a point where I can accept the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the Sacraments more generally, Apostolic succession, icons, ritual prayer (be it the Rosary or the Jesus Prayer), and with some trouble and faith, veneration of the Saints and Mary especially. 

I‚Äôm an academic at heart. I cannot not think. To me Catholicism and its scholasticism is highly appealing, the application of reason to understand God and nature. The synthesis of Aristotle and Plato to Christianity culminating in Aquinas is fascinating. 

Yet, I find Catholicism to be highly penitential. The conception of Purgatory is very difficult to accept as just and good (a Treasury of Merit seems suspect), and the mortal/venial sin distinction seems legalistic. Is God so unjust as to send someone to hell if they make a mistake and fail to confess it? I agree confession is critical, but must I feel like the knife is on my neck when I do it? My Orthodox friend has suggested to me that much of this is a result of scholasticism and Thomism. That Orthodoxy does not make such distinctions because to do so is to attempt to understand the mysteries of God. And that Orthodoxy is about love of God rather than fear of Hell. That sin is less about the law being broken and more about sickness of the heart needing to be tended to.

Is this understanding of Catholicism and Orthodoxy correct? Is the soteriology between the two substantively different or is it a matter of emphasis and form? Do I perhaps cling to sin more than I should? I do not  intend to slander the Catholics in this post, as I understand their arguments and love for God. But I desire an Orthodox perspective to it all.

When atheists or non Christian slander the Catholic Church, I can understand it. But during the years, I noticed a pattern of slander that came from the Orthodox front, specially among converts (from Protestantism I suppose, hence already primed to hate Catholicism). And it grieves me.

Modern, serious historiography has done much to correct many of the worst legends about the Church. But many Orthodox seems to define themselves in opposition to us - ""no, we have nothing to do with Catholics, we are innocent as angels, us, never hurt a fly"". They will talk about the colonization of the American continent, knowing next to nothing about the Papal bulls against the exploit of natives, or the tractates written by Thomists in order to defend the rights of such natives *qua* persons. They will also reiterate many stereotypes against the Crusades, that secular historiography already dispelled: curiously, Steven Runciman was a pioneer in this with his books about the Crusades, and he wasn't an atheist but an Orthodox convert. Lot of words are still written about 1204, but almost next to nothing about the massacres of Latins from the part of Byzantines. And no, the Pope did not approve that act in the slightest.

So on. Yes, the history of our Church is generally bloodier that yours (willingly bypassing Tzarist Russia...) and has many dark aspects, but the Church also built an entire civilization. From the first hospitals and universities, to every kind of charity and an unending flows of saints who spent their lives, it is simply not right to insist only on the faults: again, that is a move that is to be expected from the secular world.",OrthodoxChristianity

And I wonder what is preventing the sharing of these religious places among the various groups?

I don't mean like Catholics and Orthodox having mass together but like, sharing the building each sect getting its chance to use the religious building for its services.

what are the rules the Orthodox have when setting up a site to be a church? do these rules prevent sharing?

Cynicism,Vasilisonofspiro,1623002484,"I am a natural cynic and skeptic. Now I believe in God and Christ‚Äôs resurrection.

"What to do, I wonder (xpost from r/Catholic_Orthodox)",Shabanana_XII,1622995841,"So, I've been making some interesting advances the past month or so on the dogmas of Vatican I, and have seen repeatedly that there is a reason this schism has gone on for a long time, and it's that there are arguments on both sides. And, sometimes, I wonder whether I have made the right choice in choosing my ""side."" I grew up Catholic, so it's particularly relevant for me, since ""ex-Catholics,"" assuming Catholicism is right, are pretty screwed. I find myself wondering whether the feeling in my heart that I'm making a mistake is due to my upbringing (and some minor spiritual trauma that afflicted me for a couple years regarding mortal sin and confession), or the Holy Spirit telling me I'm wrong. My heart says the latter, I admit, but my mind still isn't sure which to believe, and I'm not sure which to trust. I think to myself of Vatican I, and I just can't see myself believing in it... but is it because of genuine grievances, or hardness of heart and rebellion against authority? I can never know, again. I think sometimes that I would, if it were possible, be both Orthodox and Catholic, to hopefully be ""covered"" either way, but it'd be pretty useless if I didn't believe the dogmas anyway. And I don't know if all this is confusion; or if I know it deep down inside me, and am just being prideful for not wanting to be seen as a Catholic after flaunting myself as an Orthodox for the past couple years.

I wish I could just be an agnostic on the subject and continue being Orthodox, but then I think I should be continuing my research, as I have an obligation to follow it where it leads, even if it means stopping being Orthodox. But I'm just not sure what to believe, and this has been pretty consistent for the past couple years, though in vacillating degrees. Behind all this, every word, of course, is the fact that I don't have the strongest desire to go to hell, personally, so I don't want to do the thing that would lead me there, but I just don't know whether that's becoming a ""heretical"" Catholic or remaining a ""schismatic"" Orthodox... or, again, maybe I do know the answer, and am just being prideful and hard of heart. And, yet, despite all that, I keep coming back to this topic, irresistibly so.

Are there any resources for this? I was thinking early saints, which had big life changes (she could relate to). Better if any came from non christian  backgrounds too. I haven't done this stuff in a few years, and it just seems that finding female stuff is more challenging.

I see no right side. It's like choosing one side of the coin over another. Or choosing the left lung over the right lung. Are we not only the one true and whole church when we are together? (Orthodox vs Catholic),Feeling-Meaning,1622985050,"Can anyone help me understand the idea of the ""one true church""? I'm going to sit down and discuss this with my priest soon (I'm also a very new catechumen). But due to his busy schedule and me being out of town for a large amount of time I decided to see what y'all have for me. 

What I see as the ""one true church"" I see the fullness of the faith passed down by the apostles to the rest of the world. When I see the Catholics saying that they're the ""one true church"" and the orthodox saying they're the ""one true church"", all I see is finite worldly bickering between two of Christ's children who are in reality both in Christ and both have apostolic succession. They both have the apostolic traditions and succession and all of their issues seem very surface level in the grand scheme of things to me. I keep reading arguments about filliouque(?)and I don't even understand how it's a problem. They both seem like finite attempts to grasp very infinite concepts and I don't really get why you would completely discommune with someone just because of something so irrelevant. It seems like we're warring over really nothing. 

I feel like with all of the schisms, it's just a shame that they happened. It's like the mirror of the church was shattered into multiple pieces, and the orthodox church is telling me to only choose their shard. The Catholics are at least more open to the unification of this broken mirror of the church than the orthodox. I don't understand why we can not be in communion while still respecting our differences when in reality we seem to be striving for the same or very similar things. Just because we came to different conclusions on certain matters doesn't mean we can't be in communion in my mind. 

Finally, both the Catholic and the orthodox's argument for why they are right and why their church can not be wrong is ""the gates of hell shall not prevail against the church. How do we get ""we can never be doctrinally wrong"" from that passage? It seems obvious to me that the gates of hell will not prevail against the church even if we are wrong on some things. The gates of hell won't prevail against anything in the first place. 

All of that to say I just don't understand why orthodoxy is so prudent that they are the one and only true christian tradition, and why they seem to refuse to unify and commune with the west, when the west seems to be very open and willing to commune. It doesn't seem charitable of orthodoxy to me.",OrthodoxChristianity

Simulation Theory! please help,Forakoldoris,1622978845,"Days ago, it seemed to me that a man may have vanished while I was not seeing him for some seconds. I started worrying that it may have been a glitch in the simulation system (if in case we are in one). I started worrying and I wanted to find an other explanation for where he may have went. After 5-15 minutes, I took photos of the place in order to show the place to a 2 friends of mine and try to find out other ways/buildings that the man may have gone to. Due to anxiety, some time later I deleted those photos without showing them. There was not any glitch in the photos. They were just normal photos of the place and nothing more. I think i was not going to say anything about simulation. I think I was not going to say anything about a glitch. I just wanted to have the photos of the place in order to find an other explanation.

What if Gods/programers heard me thinking about a possible glitch and thought that I knew something or that I was seeing something like an evidence? What if They/they thought that I took photos in order to expose Them/them? What if They/they wanted to punish me for taking photos? I took the photos because I just wanted to find an other explanation and there was not any glitch in the photos. In the end, there are more than 4 ways/buildings that the man may have gone to but still, I worry.

Some coincidences happened that I worry that it may be bad signs from Gods or the programers bout the photos.

Some of the coincidences:

1) I assumed that I will read some expressions of excitement in a covid vaccination topic because I remembered reading such expression in an older topic. So, I assumed that I may read in the newer one too, some expressions of excitement. Indeed, someoone wrote one of the expressions that I assumed I may read. That triggered my automatical intrusive thought and I randomly thought that now, I may see something related to simulation in the username/signature of the one who posted that phrase and it may be a bad sign about my worry. I checked the username/signature and there was no relation. I scrolled a few comments and the last one had a link with a game that had the word ""Simulator"" in its title. I opened the link and there were images of the game that were even more related to my ocd. I asked the one who posted it, why that link was posted and I was told that the link was put in order to make fun of people who get excited about vaccination. The link was a dlc of the game that is about covid. The game dlc was kinda lika a parody.

2) I was in my bed with eyes closed. I was thinking as usual, some stuff about my worries and some non-realted. I started losing control of my thoughts and I cant remember what I was thinking but suddenly I started thinkning vividly the phrase that can be roughly translated as ""go to hell"". Almost a second, I think I heard my brother from his room, taunting players in his online game by saying the same phrase, almost exactly as I said it. I did not hear the words clearly but the ""melody"" sounded like the phrase of ""go to hell"". I cant remember what I was thinking and I ended up thinking that phrase. Its a rare phrase that we never use. Probably, I was thinking something unrelated to my worries about simulation, but what if I was thinking about my worries and then, this coincidence happened? Could it be a sign?


3) I was thinking about an other  coincidence many many times. I was watching a youtube video that was about a video game ""Uncharted"". I randomly clicked in a random minute while I was thinnking about that tourist. and his rare hat, I heard a quote from the video of the video game that was saying ""thats not a good sign"". The video game character said it because he was climbing a wrecked train and suddenly, heard a noise that indicated that the train may fall off the cliff. Thats why he said ""thats not a good"" (the train may fall). What worries me is that from all 18 minutes of the video, I randomly clicked the minute that had that quote while thinking about a coincidence?",OrthodoxChristianity

Still, I worry because I cant confirm it 100%. What if They/they misunderstood me and thought that I was trying to capture evidence, even though I was not?

3) I was in a supermarket and randomly I saw a man that his face was maybe kinda similar to the face of the video game character from the game of the first coincidence. Not only that, but both wear gray hats. The video game
character wears typical gray hat with circular shape and the man in the market was wearing a gray sun hat but circular shape, kinda like those fishing hats. 

4) I was thinking about the man in the market many times (third coincidence). I was analyzing the coincidence again and again. Suddenly, I started focusing on his hat. I was having thoughts like ""why he had to wear a gray circular sun hat? do people wear those hats
often?"" and some other thoughts regarding the hat. Some seconds later, I randomly saw a man that looked like a cheap tourist, wearing a black cappas hat with a feather in an almost empty street. I think it was the first time
I was seeing that hat in my city. Everything was so random. I started worrying that the randomness of that tourist and his rare hat could be a sign because I was thinking about a hat.

5) I was thinking about the tourist with the rare hat (fourth coincidence) many times. I was watching a youtube video that was about a video game ""Uncharted"". I randomly clicked in a random minute while I was thinnking about that tourist.
and his rare hat, I heard a quote from the video of the video game that was saying ""thats not a good sign"". The video game character said it because he was climbing a wrecked train and suddenly, heard a noise that indicated that the

Why would Gods or the programers would want so much to give me bad signs that can be explained as coincidences? I am a mentally ill man and I took photos of the place in order to find other explanation for where the man may have went. 
I took the photos because of my ocd worrying. I needed so much to find an explanation for where he may have gone to. I was not trying to expose anything. I am angry with my luck because if I was 5 seconds later, I probably would not
 have seen that man. I have asked for specific signs from Gods or the programers to know if these coincidences were signs and nothing happened. So, I guess they are just coincidences but what if Gods or the programers give signs

An Update was owed I feel.,DarkestDaysofLight,1622951097,"I feel the need to make a final post to this account, I know sometimes people follow old accounts that talk about suicide in the one sub, but this spans three different subs and this one feels like it is the most appropriate.  
  
If you look my submitted history is very small and consist a lot about my past suicidal state and my depression, this was an alt account to my main because I never wanted my ex-coworkers to know the struggle I had gone through. I will summarize it though, February 7th of 2018 was the first time God saved my life. I attempted suicide that day (sometimes I think back about it and have the thought I did die was it not for God), I had a thought and I have now come to learn this was a thought given to me from God thanks be to Him that I needed to pray the Our Father over and over or I would die. I did this  from the moment I was put into the ambulance till the moment I fell asleep that day in the hospital. After that move forward to May of that year, I struggled continuously with suicidal thoughts and intentions I met a guy named Arznick on Reddit in DMs he over time introduced me to the Coptic Church. Move to June, I met a Coptic Priest Abouna Reweis from that point until my baptism a year later June 28 2019 he helped me through the darkest times of my life. He was a very good teacher and father to me and raised me in the faith instilling values in me that I still look back on and learn from.  
   
In all of that time from 2018-2020 I am sure I put many people at odds with me in the online community and I do ask for forgiveness of that if I wronged anyone, I often was mentally unstable and would take it out on them. Moving from one passion to another, thinking I was an expert in many things, when in reality the only expert I was and expert of was sin. Then came what I see as the Dark Age.  I am sure I am not the only one who struggled through 2020, it was a very dark time for all of us as many of our churches were closed, for me this was as if I was cut off from Life its self as the Holy Body and Holy Blood was my medication for my depression something I still can not to this day rationally explain as I never took medication again for my depression after my suicide attempt for fear I would attempt again. I struggled in my decision of being baptized into the Coptic Church seeking out the Eastern Orthodox Church and forsaking my home, I know this is a primarily Eastern Orthodox sub so I do not want to get into any debates over who is right and who is wrong in the schism, while the churches were closed I attended an Antiochian parish downtown it wasn't the same. I reached out to an OCA priest and even started attending catechism classes after multiple emails between this priest, my own priest, my bishop, and many others I settled in on sticking with the faith I was baptized into. Then what I can only attribute to Gods timing I met another person on Discord, I can only remember his irl name so we shall call him M. M went to the only Coptic church I had visited when I was a catechumen, I told M about my struggles with the faith and the lack of ""attention"" so to say from my own priest in my struggles (I bother my current priest way to much, but this is what I need and this is what helps me) and he told me he knew the perfect person for me. The fact that amazes me the most is this person out of all the people on discord, all the religious servers, out of everything, went to this church I had visited once before truly from God.  
  
Move to 2021, I have been with my new priest, who is my current priest for a few months now (this is early 2021) and although I still struggled in my faith he is gentle with me and guides me exactly how I need, he is truly a saint in my eyes. I also was introduced to a Zoom Orthodox Bible study and a Zoom Book Club both led by the same priest which this was a blessing from the darkness of Covid as the priest Abouna David is all the way in Chicago! Now through all of this I was still a depressed and anxious person, in 2020 my father died from cancer and I was unable to mourn, an Eastern Orthodox Hegumen that I consider a friend helped me deal with my grief in this. In my life I always stuck to myself, I never spoke to anyone and before COVID when I attended Liturgy afterwards at the Bible study one of the priests had to lead me in then would always have me sit next to him at the table with all the priests because if not I would just hang in the back. So with all of that being said during the Great Lent we had Holy Unction, prior to this I had tried to have Holy Unction done for me but something always happened that prevented it. I had this idea in my head that this was the last option for God to cure me if He willed it and if not then I would have to deal with my mental illness and fight the rest of my life not to end my life.  
  
In the months leading up to Holy Unction a trial fell upon me, and I ended up having a decision to make I didn't know what to chose for this decision and I prayed a lot for God to make my choice clear on what I was suppose to do. If I stayed and accepted my trial I would handle it the best I could but I knew with my mental illness I would not be able to and it would ultimately lead to my suicide, if I rejected my trial my future was uncertain but at least I knew I could put my strength to fighting my own demons and keep myself alive in this world pushing the temptation of suicide away. So April 23rd Holy Unction happened, my priest made sure I was there at the service, I prayed the night before, and prayed at the service as well I can't give you a good explanation of what happened only that the broken parts of my soul were mended instantaneously, I was anointed and I could feel the difference. I know this was all from Gods mercy, and I knew this was the answer to my prayers of what I should do in regards to the trial at hand to which I have accepted it.

Since God healed me there have been many times that I normally would fall into depression, but now it is as if the shackles have fallen off of me and I have the armor of God on that I can reject these notions of despair or depression the thoughts that come upon me if something happens that is disappointing I can freely see what lesson God has to teach me in it. I turn to prayer now so much easier. I can't ever express my gratitude for what God has done for me, there is nothing I can do that could convey that at all. I have friends at my parish now, I talk to people easier, I feel normal and able to have normal relationships. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. Take it for what you want to make of it, I don't think I would ever see a therapist again because one I do not have the money for that and two I do not think they could understand what God has done for me (there are no Orthodox therapist as far as I know in my area).  
  
One last thing though, I would change nothing in my life, not a single thing. Because if I changed anything I am afraid I would lose my one passion, my one wish I have, my one continuous thought ""I want to see God when I die, I want to be with Him and hear the words ""I have always loved you""

The Cross You Bear,IrinaSophia,1622927614,"A troubled and burdened man prayed and prayed that God would lift his 	burden. Day after day he prayed that his life would be easier and he begged 	for God's intervention. 
	
One day, Jesus came to the man and asked, ""My child, what troubles you?"" 	The man replied that his life was full of turmoil and that it had become too 	much to bear. He again asked for help stating that he just couldn't continue 	to go on. 
	
Jesus, feeling the man's anguish, decided help was in order. The man was 	so happy that his prayers were about to be answered that his burden already 	felt lighter. 
	
Jesus took the man to a room and stopped in front of the door. When he 	opened the door, what the man saw was amazing. The room was filled with 	crosses; little crosses, big crosses, giant crosses. The man, bewildered, 	looked at Jesus and asked how this would help him. Jesus explained that each 	cross represented a burden that people carry; small burdens, big burdens, 	giant burdens -- and every burden in-between. 
	
At this point, Jesus offered the man the opportunity to choose his 	burden. The man, so excited that he was finally able to have some control 	over his life, looked around the room for just the right cross. He saw a 	tiny little cross way back int he corner. It was the smallest cross in the 	room. After a bit of thought, he pointed to the cross and said, ""That one, 	Lord. I want that one."" Jesus asked, ""Are you sure, my son?"" The man quickly 	replied, ""Oh, yes Lord. Most definitely, yes."" 
	
Jesus turned to the man and replied, ""My child, you have chosen your own 	cross. It is the burden you already carry.""

What is the latest status of the Moscow-Constantinople schism?,Shabanana_XII,1622922270,"It's pretty bad, and as much as I hate Catholic polemics of, ""There is no one Orthodox Church,"" it seems the current situation is not good at all. I read that Moscow forbade awhile ago clergy *and* laity from taking communion in parishes under the EP, so it's not just something affecting the higher-ups. God knows we don't want a second Great Schism, but Bart seems to not be in favor of hosting a council to solve this. Do we just hope, like a bad Pope, Bart or Kirill just drop dead and pray the successors would be better? Again, not into the Catholic polemics like the one mentioned earlier, or, ""This is what happens when you don't have a (Vatican I) Pope,"" but there is some truth that the current situation is precarious, especially given how ""confederate"" Moscow tends to be, which I think is partially why this situation is so problematic (in addition to the stupid move of recognizing the UOC, of course).",OrthodoxChristianity

Question about Olivet Discourse,ShadowAley,1622888021,"Hello friends. I am a Protestant looking into my beliefs and am rediscovering my faith. 

Currently the biggest challenge I‚Äôm facing is this:

When reading the Olivet Discourse, Jesus clearly states ‚Äúthis generation will not pass away..‚Äù you know the rest. I‚Äôve heard the many explanations. The idea that Jesus was referring to a race (in particular the Jews or the Human race) seems far fetched and out of place. 

One line of thinking that I‚Äôve got is that Jesus is referring to the destruction of the temple when he states ‚Äúthis generation‚Äù, and is quite obviously using OT descriptions on judgement for the people (judgement resulting in the destruction of the temple). I like this and would go even further in saying this could be a dual-fulfillment prophecy. 

The problem I am running into is this:

Modern secular scholarship (I know, take them with a grain of salt) likes to stress the fact that the earliest followers expected an imminent second coming of Jesus. This is shown in the later Epistles. They even go so far as to say the letters that temper expectations about the second coming (ie 2 Thessalonians and 2 Peter) are forgeries in order to sustain Christianity when people saw the apostles dying without Jesus returning. I myself see this as an extreme stretch, however I do think there is a point to be made here. It is clear that at least some of the earliest followers did indeed think that the second coming would happen in their lifetime. 

Say you take the Olivet Discourse as Jesus purely referring to the temple and its destruction. Where else does Jesus talk about his return to his disciples? (I may have completely looked over some places so please correct me here).

Considering converting to Orthodoxy,Electronic_Bus_7251,1622836914,"I am baptized as a Catholic and lately I have strongly been considering completing my confirmation.  A couple things are holding me back, so I'm starting to wonder if Orthodoxy might be better for me.  I will keep praying about it and continue doing research, but it would be nice to get some input.  

I can pretty much get on board with everything in Catholicism except I have a lot of hesitancy when it comes to the papacy.  I'm not sure if everyone has heard of the the mass graves discovered at a residential school in British Columbia recently, but that's really been all I can think about lately.  It makes me sick to my stomach to know that the Catholic church was involved.  Also, the fact that Pope Francis won't apologize makes me very skeptical of him.  Learning about this news nearly made me want to turn away from Christianity all together.  Even though I don't know about my ancestry, I know that I have indigenous blood in me as my family comes from Mexico and it's very apparent in my physical features.  It's just left me feeling quite confused and devastated.  At this point, I can't move forward with the Roman Catholic church.

I was thinking maybe Islam would be right for me, but that would mean denying Jesus as the Messiah which I don't think I'd ever be able to do.  I still want a relationship with Jesus because His presence in my life is undeniable.  I remembered that I visited a monastery in Eastern Europe a few years ago which I loved, so I have started looking into Eastern Orthodoxy.   I would like to learn more about it and attend Divine Liturgy.  I'm a bit intimidated because it seems like there's so many types of Orthodoxy.

My Family is Convinced the Biblical End Times are Near,maddiefb,1622782482,"*sorry in advance for the long post or if this isn‚Äôt the right subreddit for this discussion*

My mom and her new husband are great, and they are both devoutly religious. I am a devout Christian as well, but I feel like I am an entirely different kind of Christian than my family. 

My family believes the pandemic and worsening economic/social conditions are a sign of the end times. However, I think throughout the course of human history we have endured and grown from much worse. Personally, I have no real reason to believe the times we are living in are end times. Also it was always my understanding that no one on earth will know when the end times are coming. 

It‚Äôs not that horrible for my family to believe in the end times, but they are becoming incredibly extremist in their views. To the point that it‚Äôs making me question my own faith in God‚Äîwhich is not something I‚Äôm particularly fond of. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that my mom thinks me pursuing my education is a waste of time since the end times are coming so soon. I‚Äôve been spending the last two weeks with my family and they have been making me incredibly anxious. I‚Äôm a somewhat anxious person usually, but their rhetoric is giving me some of the worst anxiety I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs making me feel like there is nothing to live for within 5 years‚Äîor that living will be a brutal existence. 

My mom wasn‚Äôt always this way, but ever since my dad passed away unexpectedly a few years ago she‚Äôs really leaned into revelations. I feel like it‚Äôs partially a coping mechanism, but it‚Äôs upsetting to have someone I trust so much hold such extremist views. Do other people share the same experience with their families? Or do you also think biblical end times are near? If so, what is your rationale? 

I‚Äôm open to any perspectives, I‚Äôm trying to understand where my family is coming from and get a deeper biblical understanding of the times we are living in. It‚Äôs frustrating because my mom and I have a great relationship outside of this, but her beliefs are making me want some distance.",OrthodoxChristianity

Being Gay and Orthodox,Elegant-Main,1622674654,"This is the first time I'm really talking about this openly to anyone other than my priest, so I hope people will be kind and understanding about my struggles and not openly judge or criticize me. 

I'm a catechumen in the Antiochian Orthodox Church since last year, I was due to be chrismated either on Holy Saturday or Pentecost, but due to the pandemic just starting around Lent I couldn't be chrismated at either time. Then a few months later, in August, my Priest asked me if I wanted to go through with my chrismation at the end of the month, initially, I had said yes, however, two weeks before my chrismation was set to happen I started experiencing some doubts due to my sexual orientation, more specifically the fear that I couldn't hold up to the Churches expectation on me being a celibate gay man. As a result, I backed out and told my priest I needed more time to discern these things. A year later I am still a catechumen and still interested in the Orthodox Church, however, my fears are still persistent. I am not sure when my priest will propose a second date for my chrismation, but I really want to be sure that I am making the right decision and not act hastily which I will later regret. For me, my biggest fears are being celibate and not marrying a man, which isn't really something I have to worry about for now since I am still young, but in the future, I can see it becoming a possibility of something I will consider. The other thing that bothers me is that there is a good number of people in the Church online and in real life who say pretty nasty things about gay people saying God will kill them or that homosexuals are impure when in reality there are more gay people in the world than most people think or realize. It worries me that if I become orthodox I will feel tempted to conceal my sexuality to avoid bullying.  My priest has been a great help to me but I still feel confused at times. 

If anyone has any advice I'm all ears and would really love to consider it. From what I've seen people in this page are very kind people.

Critical Race Theory and Orthodoxy,jdsmith2k18,1622672688,"Hi, I hope this doesn't get deleted, it's a serious question I've been struggling with. I am a Lutheran considering converting to Orthodoxy. It's also important to mention(due to topic) that I am a African-American male. I've noticed that liberalism and Marxist ideologies such as Critical Race Theory are wrecking havoc in Protestant denominations in America, and in my denomination. I believe it has no place in the church, that we unity and identity in the Christ, not in the color of our skin. I have several other issues with CRT. Anyways, I was wondering if CRT ideology has impacted the Orthodox church? Maybe I'm just being naive in my hope that the Orthodox church isnt impacted by these ideologies or other secular ideologies.l, and remains United and pure, United in Christ. Because thats what I'm looking for and honestly it would make Orthodox even more attractive. Because protestantism is so shaky, so easily corrupted and shaken by every wind of doctrine. Anyways, I'd like to know what you guys are seeing in your parishes?

Feelings of uncertainty in the ecclesiastical relations of the Church,science_is_life,1622658140,"Lately I've been learning more and more about the so called ""politics"" of the Orthodox Church. Obviously it's not even as close to as bad as the fragmentation of the Protestant churches, but our Church seems to be having a lot of issues ecclesiastically. It's causing me some uncertainty and fear for aoryhodoxy. Don't get me wrong, I am fully convinced of the Orthodox faith, and I think our theology and spiritual way of life are correct. Especially over Protestant and Roman Catholic practices and teachings. 

Now part of me thinks this is a result of the great schism. The Roman Catholic church holds very well together and I think that's because they do have the pope. However their doctrines on papal supremacy have clearly caused overwhelming issues for the church. Whereas the Orthodox Church has correct theology and practices, without the pope as first among equals, our ecclesial relations aren't strong enough to prevent a fracturing Church.

What are some ways to cope with this reality? What are your thoughts on our situation?",OrthodoxChristianity

What about Exodus 20:4?,Michaelo_El_Grando,1622640971,"So, I grew up in a russian orthodox family but I've never been very religious, nor have my parents. However, I've always had these beautiful orthodox icons all over my house so I kind of see it as more of a cultural thing.

Although, recently I've been turning more and more to Christ, praying and reading the Word and learning about Christianity. Now, there were quite a few things that I've noticed that are written in the Bible but tend to clash a little bit with the practices of the orthodox church.. 

Take for example Exodus 20:4 : ""Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth""

God basically commands us not to practice idolatry, and yet I've always had to pray to Icons and kiss them when I went to church with my parents.. I've always kinda felt that something was off and now I'm even left with more questions.. Or am I interpreting something incorrectly?

Can Calvinism Actually Be Orthodox?,axe_enthusiast,1622599845,"To be clear I'm not talking about all the theological opinions of John Calvin or his theological descendants, as is pretty usual I'm referring to just the soteriological aspects of Calvinism. I think this question also can be asked of the more established of the Christian traditions that came out of the Reformation such as Lutheranism.  

I'm sure many bigoted internet dwelling Ortho-bros will dismiss this out of hand, but I think that it because they are ignorant of the nature of this question. You see John Calvin spoke and wrote in French and Latin leading to linguistic misunderstandings between Eastern Orthodox Christians and Calvinists. Eastern Orthodox Christians, being synergists, dismiss Calvanist soteriology as heretical as they are under the mistaken understanding that Calvinism implies monergism, but in reality if you sift through the linguistic misunderstanding you will find that in reality Calvinists are not monergists but instead are more accurately understood as miaergists.  

You see where as synergists believe that salvation involves some sort of cooperation between divine grace and human will, and monergism insists that salvation is only dependent on the will of God. Miaergism on the other hand insists that the will of man, does play a role by being what the grace of God has complete influence over to whatever degree God pleases. You can look at quotes and see that the idea is that man can will for good, but only through the support of God's grace. Therefore we can read quotes like, ""This being admitted will place it beyond all doubt, that man is not possessed of free will for good works, unless he be assisted by grace, and that special grace which is bestowed on the elect alone in regeneration."" and see that there there isn't one simple will, mono, but rather a composition of Gods will and mans, which is being assisted by God's will, which would more properly merit the title of miaergism.  

Further, rather than always being rejected by Orthodox bishops miaergism was seemingly accepted by St. Cyril I Lucaris, who's official glorification took place by decision of the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Alexandria on 6 October 2009, and who's memory is commemorated on 27 June. This can be seen in some of his writing to Roman Catholic and Protestant Christian leaders, which function as sort of primitive joint statements with so called ""monergists."" Miaergism can also be seen in a few places in the third book of three of Saint John of Damascus' On The Orthodox Faith, found in his Fount of Knowledge. Because we know that miaergism is not opposed to the Orthodox understanding of this issue, as I have insisted to and changed the word from monergism to miaergism and it would be bigotted to not take this to mean that I am correct, we can see that this theological pillar of the Orthodox Church himself is in agreement essentially in what he teaches with the acceptability of miaergism with the Orthodox faith.  

With all these things being pointed out I don't see how we can get around that miaergism is an acceptable belief within the Orthodox Church, and that those who hold to it should have the ability to speak freely about it here and that just as the mods filter other slurs such as monophosite and uniate (really miaiates), use of the slur monergist should be removed by moderators and spoken up against by the community.",OrthodoxChristianity
Non-Religious Spouse and Acceptance,A_Gallant_Djentleman,1622598529,"Hi guys, I'd like to throw something out there in hopes of some feedback. I'm sum things up as much as I can....

I was raised in Southern Baptist and Methodist from essentially birth until about 17, but it never resonated with me. I stopped attending church around that time so it's been a good 25 years since I've attended any organized religion service other than funerals. I wouldn't say I was ever a non-believer, but the hypocrisy I witnessed along with the bewildering intertwining of evangelical Christianity and politics basically ended things for me with the church as I knew it. For years I've studied Eastern Orthodox on my own, pray, and am kicking myself for just giving up on organized religion based on the evangelical variety I was raised in (from Deep South)....

My wife was not raised with any religion and is not a Christian, although she believes in God and greatly admires Jesus (doesn't believe he was the son of God, rather a highly moral teacher who was way ahead of his time). She really has had no exposure to Christianity other than myself, and of the 11 years we've been together, most of that time I was fallen away from everything due to the aforementioned experiences, so the topic was rarely broached. Now from what I've gathered, there's no way I would ever be permitted to join the Orthodox Church because my wife is a non-Christian and has never been baptized in any Trinity based church. My main question is would I be welcomed to *attend* an Orthodox church, even considering my being ""unevenly yoked""?

* I'm not going to divorce my wife

* My goal is to bring her to Christ through my actions, testimony, and continued education

Does Eastern Orthodoxy even have a firm doctrine of what it takes to get into the Kingdom?,GoatsandRoses1970,1622595987,"I know that a similar question has been asked below,  but after 2 years of study, I still can't get a coherent answer about ""salvation"" in Eastern Orthodoxy (i.e. what  a person does to get into the kingdom of heaven.)  Some Orthodox writers seem to indicated you can be all right, but if you fall into prelest at the last second of life, you're done for.  Others (from monastic backgrounds) seem to say that a person needs to achieve theosis at least as far as purification of the passions. Thus, only the ""Saints"" go immediately to ""Heaven."" By contrast, others seem to believe that as long as you're walking on the path of life (obedience) to God (no matter how weak you still are)  vs. death (rebellion and sin), you're okay.  Others talk about ""acquiring the Holy Spirit."" Still others say that Jesus has already given the baptized person what's needed salvation, in a sense. You only have to maintain it through repentance, normal church duties, and working with God.   Our priest says that salvation in Orthodoxy isn't about ""morality,"" and yet there's always messages about keeping the commandments of God. 

I realize that ""salvation"" in Orthodoxy is very individualized, and that God is going to judge each of us based on what we were given an what's in our heart.  But are these different views just different ""takes"" on the doctrine of salvation from different theologians/streams of thought in Orthodoxy?

I had a crazy idea last night. Why not start attending church again and participate fulling (including receiving communion) as though I believe even though intellectually I don't believe? After all, who actually believes any of that stuff 100%? It's not like I'm an atheist. I do believe there might be some kind of God, and old habits die hard. It is difficult to seek God without a framework, and I find myself using the Christian framework out of old habit. I was indoctrinated from childhood, so I will never be free of Christian belief entirely.

Receiving communion would be important, because otherwise my mother would suspect that my faith has changed.

&amp;#x200B;

I disagreed and argued with her.   But now my faith has doubts.   How do we know our God is the true God and our religion is right if it has shares much in common with other faiths?   For all we know the religions we were influenced by had it right, or we all had elements of it right.

Recently I have discovered that I have been living with a spirit of fear my entire life. if I look back to my childhood, I would have these very scary instances where it was difficult to sleep alone. I would have very bad nightmares at time, and when my brain was in this elevated state of awareness from fear, even the slightest noise could make it worse. I was then thinking of this verse last night.

 For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.

So I have been thinking to myself again lately, I have been living in fear again once as a child. Last night, I prayed to the Lord in my bed to remove this spirit of fear from me and I fell asleep shortly after. But then I woke up at the 3 hour mark and had this feeling of fear attack me. This is when it feels like guys. I then felt something breathe on me. And then for many hours I had trouble falling asleep, but with saying the Jesus Prayer and communication from God, I felt a sense of warmness and love, and this feeling of fear went away but it was not easy.

Please pray for me guys in the name of Jesus Christ to overcome this spirit of fear. If you are struggling with this, please post here and I will pray for my Brothers and Sisters in Christ. May God Bless you all. Chrst Is Risen!",OrthodoxChristianity
Ashes,Equivalent-Call-7267,1622505490,I do actually have a question my mom wasn't orthodox Christian and  I'm new to orthodoxy. She donated her body to be studied for cancer research and they cremated her. I suppose I have several questions her burial has fallen on me although I just now have the funding to bury her ashes. My older brother said he wanted nothing to do with it. I will say that she was a Christian although baptist she led intercessory prayer and lived her life following readying and applying the scriptures daily in her living there's really no way of me explaining it too much further. She was praying up to the day she passed away for my brothers soul and those around her. She did die of cancer and it still baffles me how she found the strength to pray and read scriptures the last month of her life. I do feel lost in what to do with her ashes and still have no idea as to whether I should ask a priest about what exactly to do I don't believe in cremation I actually know she didn't either but I think she allowed the doctors to study her body after death because she had no money for arrangements. To explain that I was back in college on an extremely tight income and asked her to live with me when she lost everything. Yes this is a slightly hard thing to ask but if you have books or anything you could suggest on handling this I'd appreciate it I've had to keep her ashes for years until I had the financial means to properly take care of the matter. Naturally I was hoping a relative would help me like her sisters or my brother but I'm on my own just as I was when she was ill,OrthodoxChristianity

How are you saved in Eastern Orthodoxy? How is it different from the Roman Catholic perspective?,BrightStudio,1622499388,"In Catholicism, what is necessary for salvation (that I know of) is partaking in the sacraments, staying away from a state of mortal sin (which so far, from what I know is not a thing in Orthodoxy) by attending confession and having your venial sins forgiven when you take the Eucharist.

Deism to Theism,PsychologicalPark227,1622420730,"Of late I've been struggling with faith in God. David Bentley Hart in his "" The Experience of God"" convinced that materialism is irrational and that there is a strong case philosophically for God. I am quite sold on the "" God of the philosophers"" that is the transcendent source of all being which is infinitely beyond being. I have a harder time believing in a personal God. Philosophically construal's of divinity like Aristotles unmoved mover, the Hindu Brahmin and the neoplatonic one make more sense  ,where the ultimate God is so beyond knowing that he doesn't directly intercede with man kind, while one can achieve union with this God one can't pray to him. 

This seems much more in line with the God who is beyond being.

"Is it possible for all the apostolic sees to become corrupt? What would you do?

I am curious about ""patriarchal authority"" in your church and would be interested in your response.

Latin Catholic: The Holy Spirit protects the Pope and his office in particular, so the Vatican organization itself will never destroy the faith or fall into heresy. This is a strong guarantee and it means the Vatican papal organization will always be a vessel for the true faith.

Orthodox Priest: It is possible that every single apostolic see and patriarchate may fall into corruption or heresy, but the faith would not disappear, it can survive underground and also local Bishops have some strong autonomous control and can rebel against heretical patriarchs. We do not have any strong guarantee whatsoever that the physical patriarchal offices are immune to ""gates of hell"" -- they might fall one day!

Orthodox Friend: It is unlikely / not probable that every single apostolic see can fall into corruption since no earthly evil can have the strength to dominate so many different churches in so many different locations. But with Vatican, there's a single point of failure, this makes it easier to be corrupted. So we have a weak guarantee based on earthly checks and balances.

Divine Liturgy cycles,lovetheliturgy,1622355846,"Been inquiring for a bit. As someone raised evangelical at point the Divine Liturgy seems very calming and deep and ancient. But also as an evangelical the structure of the Divine Liturgy can at times make it very difficult to penetrate. 

It‚Äôs hard for me to sing the same songs (Psalms, prokeimenon, trisagion, etc.) with very little variation and not start to lose the feeling that I had my first couple of times, which may have been a feeling of awe due to novelty. 

Having said that, these are my questions: what does change week-to-week in the Divine Liturgy? I know the hymns change during lent, Pentecost, and advent; but what about in the between times? At first glance it looks like it‚Äôs exactly the same week-to-week but in the cycling tones. 

I‚Äôm not intending this to criticize the Divine Liturgy, I know it‚Äôs a personal weakness/lack of understanding on my part and perhaps you could pray for me to be developed in that way.

When I talk about modernism I talk about the package of secularism, philosophical materialism, and materialism as an underlying value of society; the spirit of the era; I encompass both its idolistic individualisms and collectivisms, and their refusal in iconoclastic postmodernism.

---

For personal context, I am a cradle Orthodox schooled in Canada, the embodiment of the newest Western enlightenment society, and up to date with the academic understanding of history &amp; the world. The modernist consensus really seems absolutely unescapable. I am up-to-date with every sin that exists, from those approved by the powers and academia, to those that even they are ashamed of.

I am a neurotic with almost-assured undercurrents of ADHD and autism. I was a studious and precocious child with a hunger for knowledge and truth. I believed it was possible to convince anybody of anything with a sufficiently-developed argument. However, I am an academic at heart and have no real tact for rhetorical or practical skills. My family is loving and well-intentioned, they were once-a-year Christians and I dragged them back to the Church with my religious reawakening in high school. Previously I had adhered to self-developed paganism as a child and then agnosticism, all superficial stuff.

Now, to make an undeserved comparison to an iconic cultural figure, I feel like the desperate protagonist from ""Notes from the Underground""; except I am 100% earnest and motivated to visit pain on the world in return.

I became addicted to depraved niche pornography by age 11 - really niche stuff, not LGBT or anything the reader is likely aware of - barely escaped with my rational thought intact (not an exaggeration), and this was really just the beginning of my exposure to the world's problems. I remember holding to sexual fantasies as a young child, even before that. Christianity became my refuge and my escape from this, and I barely managed to forgive myself for those actions. 

However, I never adjusted to my new country or my brush with its excesses. Long story short, the upshot is that I am prone to visions of self-righteous torture and debauchery whenever I look at innocuous elements of the world. I can look at a bucolic countryside and imagine addiction and demographic collapse, I can look at an urban skyline and see the decaying ideal of Sex-and-the-City, I can look at a happy immigrant family and imagine the parents stuck in hellish senior homes while the children spiral into sexual depravity and esoteric fetishism of a thousand kinds (because this was almost me!), I can look at a hospital and imagine all the futile treatments being administered to obese or depressed self-destructive people who will kill themselves at the public expense. To reiterate, I am really a neurotic. As an example of an everyday event for me, I recently looked at a building's facade while passing in the car, my first thought was of the construction industry then the factory that shaped the concrete bricks then the workers who laid them into place.

---

I see the world is drowning in sin, and the powers ruling the world are doing their best to spread their various brands. Of course that's nothing new, but the powers have never been more powerful, and they have never been able to undermine human institutions with 100% certainty before. With the Internet and widespread smartphone accessibility, they now can. 

I am supposed to be consoled by the fact that there is no ontological difference between sin / sinners today and in the past, that Jesus died for our sins and that we are still redeemed, that anybody who asks earnestly will receive the grace of God and sin is powerless in the face of the Church. 

Well, they won't ask. I might have managed this with my extraordinary sin before, but I am exceptional in many ways, and it was all ultimately worthless since I avoided one self-destruction to fly into the jaws of this overwhelming pessimism. Yet I don't care about what an individual can do, I care about the whole. Considering the defining feature of our times, the Internet, the masses overall dedicate thousands of hours more traffic to brainless entertainment (including porn...), rather than study of anything meaningful let alone religion and science. The world is proportionately more peaceful and lawful than ever - or at least it very recently was - but that doesn't prevent people from labeling it a cruel world and blaming God for troubles they don't even consider on any deeper level, and simply use as an excuse to deny God in this way. In the West particularly, ideologies like antinatalism and philosophical misanthropy are on the rise. People are angry that the world is not a utopia, while no previous society has known mass literacy or abundant food access or on-hand entertainment, to the extent of the West. And the entire world is becoming like the West. They drown in comfort then seek its darkest depths, I was a poor immigrant thrown there and I must face their ridicule for trying to claw my way out.

Even failing that, Russia is a cynical antihuman oligarchy, the Chinese are practically neo-Nazis, Charismatic usurpers are spreading throughout South America, the German Catholics are on the verge of schism over LGBT issues, and Africa is being ""civilized"" in the sense that they too are greedily adopting materialism and their birthrates are dropping. The CIA has declared an intent to pursue and undermine ""far right radicals"" in Eastern Europe which will encompass the Church as well, make no mistake. The modern paradigm does not understand the difference between disapproval and hatred, so we will be targeted for our understanding of marriage first.

Greece is infested by the West's political excesses and the one assured Earthly miracle of the Holy Fire is *practically right there* across the Aegean, but still the politics marches onwards! HOW?!

---

The Christian response based on what I have seen, is to sit on one's hands, and basically do nothing. I see the same arguments from fifty, sixty, seventy years ago, barely altered. The world sees this as the same old discredited crap, we cannot reach the world with honesty, it is gone and cannot be saved. What we needed 5, 50, 500 years ago was an Iran-style revolution. Our children spend most of their lives either in school being taught to tolerate worldly evil, or else they are in direct contact with their friends at all hours and will inevitably fall into ""youth culture"" being the digital wilderness where temptation spreads unchecked. Orthodoxy may offer more mysticism, nuance, living history, etc. than any other denomination nowadays; but this is nothing that the mass-media-whore cannot slander and destroy. I have zero doubt in my mind that we would fare the same as the Protestants did. The users of this forum and certain youtube circles would distance themselves and apostasize due to association of the subject matter with the far-right, the rest would actually radicalize, and we would be divided and ruined. Even if we were killed and martyred, it would be censored, we would be vilified, and nobody would care.

Yes, I am incredibly biased, yet I have always been the first to suffer in every problem that overcomes the modern youth, and I feel practically alone in overcoming any of them at all, or their impact on my life and self image.

I do not doubt God, I seem uncapable of abandoning the Christian cosmology. I am incapable of despair to the point of suicide, I have had vivid visions of self-harm but it doesn't stick. Yet I don't care about my own fate to any extent, I really don't, I only care that the world is falling into wholesale domination by demons, by phenomena and mechanisms that would be considered unthinkable to our ancestors. I had overcome my demons and become normal, then the world ""normal"" became dirty and bigoted and was replaced with myriad political neologisms that have achieved wide acceptance within less than a decade.

We lost with Ockham's nominalism and the development of Late Medieval philosophy, we have been losing ever since, we have witnessed exponential decay in the 20th century, and now the basic institutions of civilization itself are failing since they are obsolete to the totalizing modern economy-state. Growing up an educated Westerner with quaint old values I am surrounded by the walking dead who glorify their death, but spit vitriol when you accuse them of spiritual suicide.

I have heard people say that things will get worse before they get better. I say that if things get much worse, they will never get better. Well, I have had enough. Since this seems certain at this point, I am about to throw in the towel.

Why should I stay Orthodox? Why should I not flat-out join a Theistic Satanist cult? The prerequisite for spiritual success and effective spiritual warfare, is *basic continuing existence*, and these people who take glee in destruction and decay are the obvious victors. Christianity's widest spread occurred when the demonic Roman Empire was baptized, why should I not visit evil so that God can baptize that? If the gates of hell will not prevail against the assault of the Church, then perhaps I should build them up or join the demonic hosts so that the faithful can actually fucking get it together? What must I do to wake up my docile family, or the likes of you? I am painfully aware that I have lost the plot and that I am essentially deranged, but what will it take for an awakening? I am the exact wrong person for this, I am too neurotic to face the enemy, too uncharismatic to evangelize, and I keep to myself in public. Above everything I am spiteful and hateful. It does not matter that I hate evil, my most private hours having been warped by it, I see evil in everyone and I hate them for it as well. I feel like I have incarnated the accuser. Absolutely nothing will stop me from one day paying back the world for what it has done to me, not my own morals, not anything; not my family, not my friends, not any innocent even in the crib. This will not be a shortsighted terrorism, it will be calculated worldly success and institutional intentional evil. Maybe this is what Stalin felt in that seminary?

Again, I have zero interest in my own spiritual health, I am tortured to the point that *I want these powers to get their comeuppance and I want their fall to be complete and I want their tools shattered* and the hapless normal person is just a tool. I want every bona fide anti-Christian, as well as every milquetoast person lost in the modern world, every powerless organ of this blasted existence, to really suffer alike since God is too merciful to provide it to any of them. My relationship with God is whatever you might imagine of a Christian who felt God does not go far enough, but was painfully aware of that.

The average person cannot be so bad if God accepted the pagan and various historical persons opposed to Him, right? No, the modern person chafes under any moral restriction whatsoever if THEY did not choose it, they would be innocents if they did not clearly understand and mock the very idea of truth, for that is the core of our metastasizing postmodernism. Modernity has perverted innocence and the idea of the Garden, Christ trampled the death caused by knowledge of good and evil through death, but through knowledge these powers trample any knowledge while keeping the death. Every modern person understands this state of innocent-sin on a subconscious level. This is incredibly perverse and I cannot tolerate it. They are simultaneously damned in this convoluted fashion, but also well-meaning in their twisted individualistic fashion.

To the universalists I say that you are ignorant morons and your well-meaning attitude will save nobody. I am chief amongst those who do not want Heaven, I know God and I want Hell. I want Hell for us broken failures, and I have felt God's revealed presence already. But modernism has overcome. Your universalism is identical in origin to my sentiment, except I am not a deluded liberal (in any sense of that ever-blasted word, going back to the political sense of the 1600s).",OrthodoxChristianity

A question regarding the canonicity of the UOC-USA.,Chrystophoros,1622329871,"Sorry if with this I bring up some delicate issue in the whole Ukrainian ordeal, but I could find none definite information on this.

I go to a parish of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA(UOC-USA). My bishop was consecrated by ""Patriarch"" Mstyslav  (Skrypynk) of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church(UAOC). It is known that the first hierarchs of the UAOC ""self-consecrated"" themselves. Mstylav, however, was consecrated by metropolitan Polycarp Sikorski, who was made bisho by Met. Dionisius, both of the Polish Church, if I'm not mistaken. Dionisius was made bishop by Patriarch Gregory IV of Antioch. 

I've read, however, this article([https://orthochristian.com/122989.html](https://orthochristian.com/122989.html)) where it says that Mstyslav's consecration was uncanonical, since it was made during Nazi occupation in the territory of another patriarchate(Moscow). It doesn't state for sure wheter that would make Mstylav no bishop at all or not. 

This other article([https://orthochristian.com/116116.html](https://orthochristian.com/116116.html)), recomended by the author of the first one, says that the faithful of the MP should approach the UOC-USA only in case of necessity.

So, would that mean, as the archbishop interviewed in the second article seems to imply, that their reception into the Ecumenical Patriarchate made their ordinations to the episcopacy valid, even if it wasn't in the first place? What about ordination to the priesthood? Mstyslav was ordained both priest and bishop by Polycarp, and so was my archbishop by Mstyslav.

I want to go to the Ukrainian Church in my city, and would like to be received into Orthodoxy there, but can I be sure that they have valid mysteries?

I‚Äôm so grateful for this subreddit. However, I have really bad religious trauma from evangelicalism, in fact I‚Äôm the same guy who posted about it here the other day. But this post is aboit today, I need help. 

Today I was downtown Toronto with my girlfriend to check out my future university campus. As I was walking in a busy area outside the mall I saw these people with signs saying ‚ÄúRepent for your sins or hell‚Äù and there was these not-so-kind (aggressive?) women with microphones and speakers yelling and preaching. They were saying things like:

- ‚ÄúJesus loves you and He is the same yesterday today and forever!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs word does not change and you need to repent or you will burn in hell for eternity‚Äù
- ‚ÄúYou will go to hell!!!‚Äù

Basically fire and brimstone theology. Now, I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with the ‚Äúrepent or hell‚Äù since it‚Äôs in the Bible, specifically Luke 13. I do fully agree the Bible is true, and Jesus loves us, and Jesus died for our sins on the cross. But I do not believe this preaching is helpful, and it does more harm than good - like how it affected me today. Like I said, I used to be a hardcore evangelical Protestant, and I used to preach EXACTLY like this (so it might be hypocritical for me to judge, idk).

But over time I realized how horrendous Evangelical theology is, how toxic and dangerous it is. Over time, it really ruined my mental health, took away my peace, and came in between my relationship with our Lord and our God. As soon as I stepped away from Evangelical Protestantism, I felt free, like chains broke off of me. I‚Äôm thankful that I found peace in the Eastern Orthodox Church, and I can‚Äôt wait to become a catechumen this fall. 

But it seems I was an idiot, and underestimated how bad my religious trauma really is. When I saw the street preachers, I wasn‚Äôt bothered at first. They had people handing out brochures called ‚Äúquestions about God answered‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure if I should give it to my nonbeliever mother or not. But these people were really pushy and overwhelming, and everything I‚Äôm describing about them doesn‚Äôt seem that bad...because it was much more overwhelming and worse in person, trust me. But as soon as I walked away from them, I had HORRIBLE intrusive thoughts.

I started to question my salvation, have thoughts saying ‚ÄúGod hates you and you‚Äôre going to hell‚Äù and I started to feel so condemned, my thoughts were against me and I prayed to God but He didn‚Äôt help me then. And as I was walking away looking for the subway station for an hour, I broke down and cried on the side of the road. I was outside a Chipotle‚Äôs and I was crying because of how much pain I have from Evangelicals and my girlfriend had to calm me down. But ‚Äúboys don‚Äôt cry‚Äù right? I also had thoughts of ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt I just let a streetcar run over me‚Äù because it was that shocking and traumatizing, and I actually considered jumping out into the road and letting a Toronto streetcar run me over. Then my heart screamed. My heart was yearning and crying for church. Now I‚Äôve never been to church before, but I want to, specifically a beautiful parish in a safer area of Toronto. I haven‚Äôt started attending but I‚Äôve spoken with the priest already over discord. But at that moment the desire for church and a safe place was super intense.

Now that I‚Äôm home, I feel God‚Äôs peace again, as if He is saying ‚Äúmy child you are safe at home now‚Äù. Today was a very overwhelming day. But I‚Äôd like some advice please. I‚Äôm going to have to live in downtown Toronto starting September for university. And I know this street preaching crap I‚Äôm gonna see it again. It‚Äôs gonna be hard to avoid. So how do y‚Äôall recommend I get over this and not be so bothered?",OrthodoxChristianity
Is Mater Dei equivalent to Theotokos?

Is it my fault that I feel as if I want to die? Can someone take me seriously?,Frolisk,1622308669,"My worry the last days is about angering Gods of the system or hte programers (if in case we are in a virtual world) by taking photos of a place in which it seemed to me that a man may have vanished. I took the photos 5-15 minutes in order to use the photos like google maps and with the help of 2 friends to find other ways/buildings the man may have went. I was worrying so much that I need to find an other explanation. i was not trying to expose anything. There was not any glitch in the photos. tHEY WERE JUST normal photos of the place.

A coincdence happened that kinda was like as if Gods or the programers may have been sending me a bad sign about the photos.

Last midnight, another coincidence happened. I was on my bed thinking about different things and also about my worry regarding the simulation. After some minutes, I cant remember exactly what I was thinking but I remember thinking a phrase that can be roughly translated as ""go to hell"". Almost 1 second later, my brother who was playing an online game in a diffferent room, said the same phrase (while taunting other players).

I tried to remember what I was thinking before thinking that phrase and I CANT REMEMBER. I remember older thoughts that I was thinking but I cant remember what exactly I was thinking that made me think the phrase ""go to hell"". I think I kinda remember my thoughts being on autopilot because I was tired and had my eyes closed but I was not sleeping. I had conscience that I was awake. Why I cant remember what I was thinking?

What if I was thinking something related to simulation? What if Gods or the programers send me the thought in order for the coincidence to happen in order to give me a bad sign again? That phrase is kinda rare and we never use it. What are the chances of thinking loudly a not so frequent phrase of ""go to hell"" and then almost a second later my brother saying it?",OrthodoxChristianity

Divorce Before Conversion and Vocation,Iago_the_Mando,1622264565,"Hello All!

I totally understand that with the following questions I will need to speak with my priest for a definitive answer, but it is one that has me anxious: If divorced Orthodox Christians are barred from serving the Church as ordained ministers (priests, deacons) what about those who have divorced before their conversion to Orthodoxy? Would they fall under the same restrictions? Would those who divorced before their conversion still require to obtain an Ecclesiastical  Divorce?

Converting to Orthodoxy as an agnostic,BigManNeo,1622258266,"Hi everyone

I've been interested in converting to the Orthodox Church for about half a year now. I grew up agnostic (at least that's what I consider myself to be), with *some* Christian influence in my life but never really practiced it. I do believe God exists and I want to grow closer to him, I want to convert to Orthodoxy because I feel like it's the right path for me and I believe it's the true church of Christ.

Now my problem lies in that there's no Orthodox church/parish nearby and the closest one is a few hours away (outside the city I live). There's also not many of them in my country (Dominican Republic) and about 70% of the country is Roman Catholic.

Is the Monarchy of the Father Orthodox?,thepickledpepper,1622254180,"What are peoples' thoughts on the Monarchy of the Father? Is it heresey? Theologomena? Dogma?

As I understand it, MOF is a doctrine about the Trinity, which says that the Father has an asymetrical relationship with the Son and Holy Spirit. Whereas the Father causes the Son and the Holy Spirit to exist, the converse relationship doesn't hold. Put another way, MOF says that the the Father has a property that the Son and Holy Spirit do not have: He is uncaused.

Since becoming Orthodox, I've come across MOF in conversations and reading, but haven't formed strong opinions about it. The doctrine-- so I'm told -- has a historical pedigree stretching back to the  Fathers, which appears to check out based on my research. But, I'm no historian, and the doctrine's penchant for attracting controversy gives me reason for pause.

The controversy surrounding the doctrine comes in several flavors. Some argue that MOF entails Tritheism. The argument here is that MOF makes the Father distinct from the other members of the Trinity, because MOF says that the Father has at least one essiential property 'uncaused-ness' that the Son and Holy Spirit don't have. In the same way that three distinct persons with a human nature are three separate humans, some argue that the three distinct persons of the Trinity, each possesing a divine nature, become three separate Gods under MOF.  

Another flavor of argument challenges MOF in the opposite direction by levying the charge of Subordinationism. Proponents of this challenge argue that putting the Father on a higher footing than the Son and Holy Spirt makes the Son and the Holy Spirit into less than God. On this view, only the ultimate cause of the universe deserves the name ""God."" Not causing the Father's existence, the Son and the Holy Spirit are robbed of their divine status, and, perhaps, MOF collapses into Arianism. 

A final objection to MOF deals with its incompatibility with the Filioque. Recall that the Filioque says that the Father *and the Son* cause the Holy Spirit, whereas MOF says that the Father alone is the sole cause of the Son and Holy Spirit. I've seen some Orthodox scholars point to MOF as the theological basis for the Great Schism, though I sometimes wonder if they are using it as a wedge issue to distinguish Catholicism from Orthodoxy. 

My thoughts nowadays have turned to [Beau Branson's work](https://beaubranson.com/monarchyofthefather/). Branson is an Orthodox philosopher who has written about MOF. He has replies to the above flavors of objections that are plausible. Basically, where I'm at now is that I am leaning towards the adopting the view, but I want to make sure I'm not crazy for doing so.

What are people's thoughts about MOF? More generally, how would you go about determining for yourself what to believe?",OrthodoxChristianity

So yesterday I went to church after work to talk to the priest who specifically guides my abusive ex. I told him everything what happened. He said it is a difficult situation and that he would need to talk to him. We talked for an hour and he said that they were having a party bc of the families were leaving the state and he asked me if I wanted to join. I said absolutely and we went outside to the bishop house. Well, after a few min I saw my ex. My whole body was just freezing and I couldn‚Äôt talk for a minute. The priest said he didn‚Äôt know about him coming. I and other women went inside the house and 10 min after he came in. There was many people but as soon as I saw him I said I was leaving. It is absolutely non negotiable to me. So I left. It feels like I am hallucinating seeing him in my community. He is an American guy who was NEVER interested in me, my culture, my people, and only said terrible things about all above. I feel absolutely terrible. That he stayed and I left with my child. I will talk to the bishop but if they say that I have to ignore him and move on I will go and get a restraining order. They might think he is remorseful. I don‚Äôt believe he is. He never apologized, only said I deserved everything and he keeps being aggressive towards me outside of the church.

I cant understand why God would allow free will, sinful nature but give rules that make it difficult to make it to heaven and give us the gift to be saved through faith. When it comes to faith, isnt natural for some people not to have faith?

Why someone's soul depends so much in faith when it is difficult (maybe at least for some people) to have faith or maintain it?

If faith gives us many chances to make it to heaven, why Christian God allowed other religions/traditions/theories in the world? There is much deception, fraud in this world. Isnt it natural for some people to be suspicious?

i guess many people believe that their religion is the right one. Why I should reject other religions but accept christianity?

i have learned about the simulation theory and there are people who have theirs beliefs and ideas about the universe. Some probably believe it so much in a same way a Christian does for his/her religion.

The Character of Sin,ValueForm,1622195459,"One of the draws of Orthodoxy to me is that there seems to be a difference in approach to sin. While Catholics and Protestants tend to present a God of judgement, the Orthodox seem to present a doctor-like God, a God that wants to heal us and rescue us from sin. To put it briefly, in orthodoxy, God appears to be truly merciful and truly a saviour. He saves us from sin, which here appears less the transgression of arbitrary rules, but rather something that is detrimental to our lives in and of itself. 

Nevertheless, there are some instances in which the evidence for this is ambiguous. Homosexuality is a sin according to scripture; I haven‚Äôt seen any good evidence to suggest that it isn‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs not clear how it is necessarily detrimental. It seems the most we can do is argue that it‚Äôs detrimental because it jeopardizes salvation, at which point the sinfulness of the sin is circular, and, perhaps worse, we are back to a vengeful judge rather than a merciful saviour. 

So, if something like homosexuality is a sin, what is sin? To me, the only reasonable response is to maintain that homosexuality is somehow detrimental to people, considerations of the afterlife set aside. At the same time, this is difficult position to maintain: statistically, homosexuality doesn‚Äôt seem to lead to major social problems, and when you care about someone who is gay, it‚Äôs incredibly difficult - without some profound ignorance of the gravity of what one is saying - to suggest or think that they should never marry who they love, that they should be celibate their entire lives, etc. 

The crux of the matter is this: if God is not the arbitrary rule enforcer presented in some traditions, what do we make of sins that don‚Äôt seem to be directly harmful to the individual or society at large? It seems at this point, we can only invoke the threat of a bad afterlife, which seems to achieve nothing more than erase the useful distinction between God as arbitrary judge who condemns those who ‚Äúdo not know what they do‚Äù and God as a merciful redeemer who saves us from ourselves. 

I think the only way out of this is to suggest that all sin truly is harmful to us, beyond the threat of hell - but certain sins (like the aforementioned) seemingly challenge this argument. Thoughts?",OrthodoxChristianity
''Controversial'' Saints,Alarmed_Business_962,1622192604,"Hi, I have heard about our ''Fathers''. The Synaxarium describes them as perfect beings, but in reality, they were a bit different.

Saint John Chrysostom: Described the Jews as Pigs who were ''fit for slaughter''. He also refers to Jews as, outsiders, illnesses, idolaters, lewd, and beast-like. His works were frequently used by Nazi-Germany in their Anti-Semitic campaigns. He's remembered as one of the greatest of the Christian fathers to have ever lived.

Saint Cyril of Alexandria: You might remember him from the Council of Ephesus. He exiled Jewish Alexandrians from Alexandria due to an incident between Alexandrian Jews and Christians resulting in many casualties on the Christian sides. The Jews made up a significant part of the Egyptian city and lived there since the Ptolemaic times of Egypt. He also closed Novationist churches and Pagan temples. Furthermore, he canonized a Scythian Monk as a martyr after he threw a stone at the Prefect of Egypt, Orestes who executed the monk. He undid the canonization because of the protests of the Christians. He too is remembered as one of the greatest saints in Orthodox Christianity.

Saint Epiphanius of Salamis: Claimed that Gnostic Christians ate babies and drank their blood during their Eucharist. He too is remembered by many Orthodox Christians.

Saint Helena: Tortured a local Jew to find the Cross.

Becoming Orthodox Help Wanted,AltAccount2432,1622165691,"!!!Warning LONG POST INCOMING!!!
¬†¬†¬† Hey if you are here and need a TL;DR it‚Äôs this ‚ÄúAny helpful information on becoming Greek Orthodox and biggest things that will be different from Mormonism (especially if you have been Mormon or no one closely like through marriage etc.)
¬†¬†¬† ¬† I was just wondering about this as I'm preparing to convert to Greek Orthodoxy. It started at roughly the beginning of quarantine (about a year-and-a-half ago)¬† when I started seeing lots of inconsistencies in the Book of Mormon when I was studying it privately and in seminary¬† (Mormon Seminary is just a high school Bible / Book of Mormon study class)I started praying a lot and looking in two other Christian religions, through my looking I ended up finding Catholicism and most of it made sense outside of a¬†few things. After more praying I ended up looking to my great-grandfather who immigrated to my country from Greece and was Greek Orthodox. The more I looked into it the more Orthodoxy made sense and my faith in it grew. In a few months or so when I'm an adult I plan on beginning attendance at the Greek Orthodox Parish near me. I've done a lot of looking online and a reading of the Greek Orthodox Bible I could find. I was just wondering a couple of main things, namely what to expect during the shift from Mormonism as well as any less obvious things I might not know about Orthodox traditions and what the most literal translation of the Orthodox Bible I can get my hands on for study is ( the closest word for word translation from ancient Greek or Hebrew Bibles). Any help is welcome.

Going to the church with my abuser,outlander4you,1622148761,"Hello all!
I need your advice on my current situation. Briefly, I married a person 3 years ago who turned into an absolutely abusive man. I was abused in every possible way, cheated on etc. I was forced to leave our home and be homeless at the end of my pregnancy. For the last two years I‚Äôve been in individual therapy and is still broken from what has happened and that I ended up being a single parent. I still have strong ptsd and panic attacks if I have to deal with my ex husband. After I left he out of the blue started learning about Russian Orthodox Church. I suspect he liked the idea that a wife must submit to her husband and he interpreted it in his abusive way. 
I started going to church on Sundays when I was able to. Recently I went again and was absolutely shocked seeing him in my church (by saying my I mean I am Russian and I found a Russian church where I went. It is obvious that i feel more comfortable among my own community). That church has also a liturgy for Americans but in a different building. My ex husband knew that I chose to go to that church. (He was going to a different one, American, since he is American). 
I couldn‚Äôt breathe when I saw him. I had a very bad ptsd attack. I felt fear (he threatened me with a physical violence). People in church didn‚Äôt know who he was as he plays a perfect family man. I decided to talk to a priest and tell him who he really is and ask if it‚Äôs possible for him to go to the American liturgy on a different time so I don‚Äôt have to live in fear coming to my church for peace. 
My ex husband already threatened me via email if I go and talk to someone. 
I understand that church is for everyone but it feels like it‚Äôs just too much. My heart is being ripped apart.

I am kinda worried/scared,RudiCaconi,1622146045,"1) I cant understand why Christian God would allow us free will, sinful nature but give us difficult rules that make it impossible to make it to heaven and gives us the gift of faith in order to get to heaven while it is hard (maybe at least for some people) to have faith? When it comes to faith, isnt natural for some people to simply not have faith? 


2) There are other religions, traditions, theories and ideas. I have learned about the simulation theory, I had a'conversation with someone who claimed to have died by suicide and had awaken inside his dream as an inner world I think. I think there many people who have their theories/ideas besides religions. And I think there are people who have much faith in their religion because they may have witnessed a miracle or seemed to them as a miracle. How can these people have faith in Jesus?

Refuting Mark Bonocore?,BrightStudio,1622066099,"I came across this argument. If you guys have any refutations, please reply to this post with it.   


 

&gt;The addition to the Creed in the Latin west doesn‚Äôt contradict the Creed for multiple reasons. The largest reason is because of the difference in meaning of the word proceed in both languages. In Greek, the term ""proceeds"" (ekporeusis) had a specific meaning, which the Latin word didn‚Äôt have. It meant to originate from a single Source, Principal, or Cause, and was used to emphasize the Father‚Äôs monarchy. The fact that the single Source, Principal, or Cause of the Holy Spirit is the Father, both Catholics and Orthodox affirm. However, the Latin word for proceeds(procedit), is a term that, unlike the Greek, does not imply procession from a single source, principal, or cause, and was used to emphasize the Son‚Äôs participation in the Spirit‚Äôs procession, rather than the principle source of the Spirit. This is why the Filioque clause(‚Äúand the Son‚Äù) could be added in the Latin creed(though not Greek), without directly contradicting the original meaning of the creed, but emphasizing a different aspect. ‚ÄúFilioque‚Äù does not deny the Father‚Äôs singular role as the Cause of the Spirit; but merely acknowledges the Son‚Äôs necessary Presence (i.e., participation) for the Spirit‚Äôs eternal procession from the Father to Someone else ‚Äìnamely, to the eternal Son. Father and Son are thus collectively identified as accounting for the Spirit‚Äôs procession. This addition of the Filioque was to emphasize the Son‚Äôs participation in the Spirit‚Äôs procession(rather than emphasizing the Father‚Äôs monarchy like the original Greek creed), to counter the Spanish Arians who denied the Son‚Äôs eternal participation in the Spirit‚Äôs procession. Even apart from the Latin father‚Äôs, among the eastern greek father‚Äôs, the confession existed that the Spirit proceeds from the Father ""through \[or ‚Äòby way of‚Äô\] the Son‚Äù, which is an expression equivalent to the intention of the Filioque clause, ‚Äúand the Son‚Äù.

Lengthy but I need to get this out. Please help. Advice welcome.,Due-Set-9188,1622064221,"I know that slander is morally wrong and from real life experience ongoing it's destruction is surreal you can't take back the damage it leaves on countless people with or without our awareness since deception is brutal and spreads nonstop. 

I'm having a hard time getting help with all I need I've been surviving a toxic mother who's been deceptive all my life and now it's at the worst even when I am out of the family dynamic and on my own. 

People I've grown up knowing and who I try to contact have turned their backs or literally insist I need help I should get committed and I don't even know what for if I am no harm or threat to anyone. I've witnessed something's last year happening to another family member I've been cut off from maliciously and had any chances of trying to help this vulnerable chronically ill person from being exploited in every aspect who can't defend themselves and had a horrible disturbing charge suddenly on him when he's likely close to death and Left lonely and abandoned but still she keeps her legal marriage convenient after all this is happening and has him signed papers barley out of open heart surgery last year? I'm not on any of the papers at all but it's by chance I found them and took pictures because later I was threatened to get out leaving the vulnerable personal with type 1 diabetes, cancer two types and other things I'm really concerned for honestly...I got threatened with nowhere to go after being asked at first help stay with my dad yes I'm talking about my dad that's why this hurts. My mother flies back in town suddenly calls a hotline says what's not accurate ""my daughter is bipolar and valuable things are missing..."" plus I didn't hear all she said but it was trauma of fear and I didn't see my ""mother"" in months but she walked in barely off the plane with a dead cold face mask kept on walked in the house she was intending to leave damaged and trashed like a house in a hoarders episode and locks and doors broke but I was trying to see what I can clean and fix on my own because my dad's health especially who she Left alone with not even toilet working in his room  but she had a van she bought with his recent retirement money secretly parked at her friend's driveway and an expensive vintage she bought in it plus who knows what else is in that van. As my dad frail arrives as the hospital shuttle dropped him off and she gave no look at him once in spite of her public postings leading people to think she's so worried for him going to see how he's doing etc... Totally not the opposite yet I witnessed first hand how she and my sister by Seattle, Washington,  caused him to be hospitalized, by the phone call to my father on speaker phone when I was trying to get him to please end the call. I was saying ""daddy please shut it off right now please this is impacting you..."" He had a stare and a look I can't forget with fear and confusion but said ""they're my family"". I got some of that audio recorded by chance but later that night I had to call the paramedics because this wasn't the usual low blood sugar episode now that he was unresponsive as the medics arrived. I called the hospital next day when I finally got in touch with a doctor he couldn't really put a word on anything yet but was asking a few questions. On the discharge papers I happened to find and take pictures of it mentioned seizures and he's never had that before. Generally there are different reasons that are normal. But... In this situation raised my concerns because of what I was seeing and can't unsee. They deliberately stressed him out on purpose it is clear in that audio I'm heartbroken by this and it worked which not only shows it's not the first time I saw literally tactics of coersion, abandonment abuse, I have screenshots of triangulation tactics to keep him in fear and demeaned, bringing his hopes up to hurt him again emotionally, it goes on and gets worse plus I'm hoping to find answers on what I don't know about some do know the problem but are in on it or it's too much so they go their own way. 

Back to the moment she arrives here in El Paso, Texas. As she called the number I'm waiting to see how my dad's doing that's natural empathy and I was technically the only one in town that's family and helping him I put myself aside gave up my other apartment to stay with my dad but he comes home from the hospital seeing multiple police cars arrive because of her planned phone call and I suddenly had no say no chance to defend myself no ride to go anywhere at all but they arrive telling me I have five minutes to get off the property or come with them. I already have PTSD and them not knowing anything going on from my side of things not giving chance to explain, looking at me like I'm disgusting and staring me down like I'm suspicious of something I don't know what I had no money at this moment because my check went to helping my dad out so where can I stay at zero notice during a pandemic? I don't have a criminal record but I'm treated worse then Anyone and I didn't do anything wrong. In that audio I have still, my dad did try to defend me as frail as he was but in the yelling at him in that emotionally torn voice as they accused me of stealing and having strangers over he did say  ""I walked all around making sure that didn't happen and I never saw anything like that etc"" yet one call my mom made as she barely arrived in town it's just as easy as a lie, an accusation, and the police do what she said and I'm being put through this trauma when I just want to be there for my dad who she's just exploiting financially getting rich off people's sympathy online. Just from his heart attack alone last year her GoFundMe for that made over $10,000 alone.... But now I don't know what led to that heart attack in this exact situation so many questions come to mind...

Fast forward a little I rented somewhere that I found out was a planned setup because one day I wasn't there and I came back EVERYTHING was gone wiped out. Locks changed everything was inside so I lost everything recently except the clothes on my back and the owners outside laughed at my reaction and holding out a phone recording my reaction and *they said* everything is gone it's with your mother... Wow so... I didn't even know how they knew who she was or what is going on but this make more sense but everything is gone and I call police and said what's just happened the landlord took everything it's basically stolen everything inside my medical equipmemt my ID, birth certificate, social security card, any physical memories of my dad, my food, everything just gone, when I wasn't there to defend myself and for that call police arrive but in multiple cars as well again and this time with a couple of units with the psych unit... Like why? They hand me a list of numbers with resources to call for counseling and emotional crisis and whatever. They give me the optometrist to drive me to either a shelter or a psych hospital.  This made no sense. on a call for theft should the mental health units even be there first? This wasn't a melt down or a psychiatric episode of any sort I really did lose everything... The loop hole is that they said I'll have to take this to justice of the peace because it's a ""family matter"" since they claim my ""mother"" had the items and was involved. Yet I don't know that and I was the only one on that lease but this was a loophole and planned. I am not a harm or threat to anyone yet this is a plan VERY similar to last year's trauma. It explained the recent humiliations slanderous posts by the landlord or who I thought was a landlord very similar to my mother's doing basically sabotaging my chances to find elsewhere to live right now and how things circulate online is damaging you can't take it back. Even the police don't take me seriously around here and that's a threat to my safety all because I'm Skapegoated in a planned way to conver someones tracks and I literally witnessed something heart Ramon and it's ongoing to an extreme I don't even know I am not in the loop. Because of the slander and hate my mother spews relentlessly anyone I've tried to contact even I have known them they are not taking me seriously no matter what I say all my support systems have been sabotaged and with a master manipulator so convincing and heartless with zero empathy behind all this, this is just a tactic because it works. It's working so far. She's dangerous and luckily an acquaintance got my foot in the door at a complex in the ghetto but it's a place to live a roof on my head they accepted me with no id so it's my chance now to use this year to sort my situation out and recover a little enough to deal with it. A neighbor, a couple that moved out of state they had to get rid of everything since they didn't want it going to someone who'll just sell online and make money they gave me all their furniture. Complete sets and they're beautiful. They didn't expect anything no money the husband said just be a good person, help people etc. Wow this was sweet and a miracle. I'm on a monthly check with disability so it goes to rent and bills and I still haven't been able to buy clothes yet but I will slowly I feel blessed and the food I'm living on is from nearby pantries who didn't require id when most do after mentioning my situation. I hate sob stories but it's kinda true at the moment. 

Where do I start? Without id at all of any kind my options are limited as much proof as I have and getting ready to print what I can as I gather files. This situation is so complicated any place I've called any legal help I'm trying for here I say a thing or two and no one will help it's suddenly not what they work with and yeah I can't do much without an id upfront so I'm screwed but I can try with legal aid but where do I start? My dad is about to possibly die alone and I don't know what's going on exactly and he'll be in a prison cell for a charge so disturbing so easily planted on a good human being and yet also I noticed anything online with his name is removed and disappeared like he never existed no explained and no one is telling me.

Slander does so much damage in more ways we all know and everyone I go to is automatically assuming I'm sick in the head and need to be committed no matter what I say... This is bad. I can't even expect police to help if I call for anything. My mother has been wanting my disability checks and this loophole she's trying for is planned. I'm not stupid and I guess loopholes and master manipulation isn't anything criminal or charged so it's working. Everyone is somehow convinced I'm crazy because that's her go to.  I post on my social media what is bothering me and someone suddenly says ""who are you who is your doctor etc"" like WOW this is extreme. Someone's trying to make me seem unstable and it's working. 

What happened? Why is everyone so convinced whatever they're told? Is it anyone's business if I see a doctor or not? Well nobody that is slandering is considering they are helping an abuser hurt and destroy and innocent person. Like do they think to themselves is this anything normal about a mother turning people against her child or husband deceptively? She's a monster. I have to be careful who knows my address. 

What exactly happened what did she say to the police department here? Will I get to be with my dad again or at least of honest support? He's dad he's been the reason I am what I Am today and alone in this world now is nothing in comparisons to not being being able to be with my dad. He's done amazing things for people and I have photos of the past in my Facebook of our lives and that's all I have to hold on to.

Are there any evangelists/missionaries in the Orthodox Church?,StationaryLover1,1622060638,"I was reading some posts discussing the ethnocentric nature of modern Orthodoxy and it got me thinking about how I've never heard of a purely missionary Orthodox endeavor. My understanding is that priests come from the old world to the new world to serve their own people, and as a byproduct, the local people get to be ministered to.

The reason behind the question is that I want to know what kind of message the missionaries were spreading to the local people who had never been exposed to Christianity of any type. I was originally thinking of Saint Herman of Alaska, although I had read that there were Russian colonists at the time, which I assume was a major driving force of him traveling there.

Does anyone know what Saint Herman's message was to the Aleuts?

Does anyone have any good maps of Orthodoxy spreading post great schism in 1054?

Veganism and Orthodox values of stewardship,Christopher12340,1622056474,"I know that the Orthodox view is that no food is unclean as discussed in Acts at St. Paul's epistles. However, I also know many monks and laity have chosen to be vegan year around and not just on fasting days. One common reason I have heard for this choice is that one is not against consuming animal products but that the modern condition of factory farming goes against Orthodox values regarding stewardship of animals and the environment because many practices have a negative impact on the environment and treat animals inhumanely. 

In a perfect world, I would make sure that I only consume animal products that are sustainable and ethical but that can be pretty cost and time prohibitive. I always go back to the idea of incorporating more sustainable, plant based foods and then having sustainable and ethical animal products occasionally. I'm just curious if anybody else has gone down that, or similar paths, and how their faith led them to that decision.

"Prayers, please.",gmhelwig,1622053431,"Christ is Risen!

Just had a visit from my parish priest to bless my apartment, and I showed him some things I had done during the pandemic during the times getting to church itself was problematic. (Annoying restrictions but at least no one said I had to burn incense before a golden image.)

To the point, Father Ambrose, my parish priest, has asked me to compile the versions of Reader's Vespers and the Typical Psalms, plus the morning and evening prayers I scanned or typed into my computer, plus pre and post Communion prayers into a booklet we can give to shut-ins and others.

So these would be what I say as morning and evening prayers, after I take out the list of names specific to me. But I had also put in additional details, with his blessing and knowledge, though I'm not entirely sure these changes are appropriate for everyone.

So, please pray that this task will bear fruit for God's glory and the blessings upon the earth.",OrthodoxChristianity
I am just spiritually lost and don‚Äôt where to restart.,Lord_Have_Mercy123,1622050075,"I am just so spiritually lost. Sorry for the fact that this post is going to be a long one.

So when I was a kid I went to church because my family did, I believed the stuff, called me self a Christian etc. Then my family stopped attending, my grandparents decided every orthodox Christian was a hippocrite and hated the clergy. This was around when I was maybe 10-12. At this point I started attending a Protestant youth group because an evangelical friend invited me.

At this youth group (which is really nice, by the way. I have nothing against these people) there was this one pastor who was a liberal Protestant, and he really influenced my theology. I was maybe 12-13 at this point. I believed gay marriage was fine, developed a habit for m*sturbation and even developed a f*tish.

I was maybe fifteen before I even started calling myself an ‚Äúorthodox Christian‚Äù again, but I wasn‚Äôt really one. I called myself that because I was baptized orthodox, because I‚Äôd lived most of my teenagehood as a liberal Protestant even when I became more in my orthodox theology (small ‚ÄúO‚Äù; was more conservative Protestant theology) I lived as if I was a total atheist (still sinning sexually, being selfish, unkind etc). It wasn‚Äôt until after I was sixteen that I really ‚Äúconverted‚Äù to Orthodoxy.

It was summer 2019 that I started attending church with my parents again, went to confession and was really scraping together my mess of a spiritual life. I really struggled with scrupulosity at this time and especially in the first two months or so I had an insanely difficult time conceptualizing faith and works, as my Protestant mind still equated this with legalism. I especially struggled with fasting, following ‚Äúrules‚Äù (for example, I fasted on Thursdays because fasting on Wednesdays is just a silly rule) and the sacraments. I felt I was in over my head and was drowning. I wished that for a few weeks I could just not attend church, figure these theological things out while working out major sins (ie m*sturbation). Well, I got my wish, but not like I expected. 

Covid struck.

I did manage in the first few months of covid to get a grip on these theological things and I even stopped m*sturbating. By maybe last spring I had mostly gotten over these difficulties, but still struggled intensely with scrupulosity. Around last autumn I had mostly gotten over the scrupulosity.

But then the apathy struck.

I was initially very zealous, developed very right wing, theocratic political views, prayed intensely, prayed typika every Sunday since I couldn‚Äôt go to chur, read the whole New Testament etc.

Around maybe winter, the zealousness was gone. 

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs not being able to attend church, but I fell back into m*sturbation, and I haven‚Äôt been to confession in a year. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. The priest at my parish is gone, and I‚Äôm worried the new one will lash out at me in confession (I have some disturbing sexual dreams involving homosexuality and incest that I want to confess even though I am definitely not gay and not incestuous). I also just feel intensely apathetic. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know where to turn. I am almost 18 (less than two weeks) and I‚Äôve basically blown it.

I don‚Äôt think Jesus even wants to save me anymore. I‚Äôve essentially stuck a middle finger in his face. 

What do I do?

Does anyone else here have religious trauma from Evangelicalism?,actuallylinkstrummer,1622042914,"I'm going to be honest here... I have a bit of religious trauma. Before I decided once and for all that I was going to leave the Evangelical Church, I had a strong pulling towards Orthodoxy (February/arch). However, I was stubborn and thought I could settle for Evangelicalism, because I was too lazy to try to convert to Orthodoxy. God helped me through that sin of sloth and now I'm 100% ready to become a catechumen. 

However, I have some trauma that's following me. I had to unfollow many Protestant IG accounts because it brought back memories of the church pain and crap I went through. I had to basically cut off anything that was Protestant or Evangelical-related, because I have so much fear and anger in me towards the Evangelical Church. I barely pray compared to before, because deep down I am scared of Jesus. The Jesus that they preached, was hateful and scary. Their version of Jesus seemed bipolar, like sometimes He was nice and kind and other times He hated sinners. Once I was told the story of the lost sheep but with an Evangelical twist. Goes a little something like this - the shepherd finds the sheep and breaks its leg so it doesn't wander off again. And the whole ""love the sinner hate the sin"" thing has still screwed me up. And I don't even want to be around them until I heal from this, because I despise their ""repent or burn"" preaching so much (I also used to preach this theology). I appreciate the Orthodox view MUCH MORE and it finally feels like I found the full truth, fullness, peace, and the true church of Christianity. There are so many other things that I've grown to hate from Evangelicalism.

Yesterday I was doing some research on clubs for college since I start this fall. I found some Christian clubs and I was curious so I clicked on them. I saw the word ""evangelical"" and my chest tightened and I panicked for a good few seconds. It's stuff like this that's affecting me. And then Satan is attacking my mind saying, *""if you don't join the Christian clubs, you're not a real Christian after all, and God is displeased with that""*. I just generally disassociate with anything Evangelical-related and avoid it like the plague. I've also become quite prideful and arrogant towards Evangelicals, my brain has this attitude like *""Evangelical Christians are lunatics, they don't compare to Orthodox Christians who have it right""* which I think stems from my trauma. Eventually, I want to learn to love them as Jesus loved His enemies and taught us to (Matthew 5:44). I cannot control these thoughts though.

So I was wondering, do any other Orthodox brethren here have a similar problem? Or have ever encountered something like this? Has anyone else on here suffered religious trauma from Evangelicalism?",OrthodoxChristianity

Thoughts on Ethiopian Orthodoxy?,Morglin121,1621960361," 

Greetings orthodox brothers. As an Episcopalian I think Ethiopian Orthodoxy is one of the most fascinating and intense forms of Christianity that exists today.  

Though their soteriology is pretty much in line with standard Catholic-Orthodox soteriology, they do continue to practice many of the dietary and purity laws of the Old Testament, and also circumcision, primarily for ascetic purposes as well as cultural reasons since their nation does have a strong link with the ancient Israelites and they even claim to possesses the lost Ark of the Covenant in one of their churches and the emperors of Ethiopia were believed to be direct descendants of a child that the Queen of Sheba bore to King Solomon. Though they are technically Hamites according to the Bible, as a culture they have close ties with the Semites and the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Ge'ez, is s Semitic language of the southern kind related to other Semitic languages such as Arabic, Akkadian, Aramaic, and of course, Hebrew. 

Their Biblical canon is by far the largest of any Biblical canon their is, containing not only the entirety of the Hebrew canon and the deuterocanonical books of the LXX, but also additional ancient apocrypha like the Book of Jubilees and 1 Enoch that some ancient mystical Jewish sects like the Essenes utilized as scripture. Their New Testament is also unique among Christendom containing eight additional books like the Patristic work the Didascalia and also works thought to have been written by Clement of Rome (though these seem to be Ethiopic pseudepigrapha).

As for their doctrines about God and Christ they stand firmly in line with Nicene-Constantinopolitan definition of God, professing faith in the orthodox doctrine of the holy Trinity (whilst rejecting the Filioque like other Orthodox Christians), and the Trinity plays an especially central role in their Church. As for their beliefs about the nature of Christ they reject the Chalcedonian definition due to the fact that they are one of the autocephalous Churches of the Oriental Orthodox Church, and hence the word ""Tewahedo"" in the offical name of their Church, meaning ""Unification"" emphasizing a sole nature (""physis"") in Christ. However, they reject the label ""monophysite"" as such a term is often associated with Docetism and Eutychianism, doctrines which they vehemently reject, and instead wish to be called ""Miaphysites"". This is actually part of a long ongoing discussion as to what Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians are really professing when they speak about the nature of Christ and it actually seems that the Ethiopian Orthodox, along with the rest of the Oriental Orthodox, actually agree with the Chalcedonians that Christ does in fact posses two natures (a human and divine nature) united by the sole person of the Son/Logos. However, these Churches have historically followed in the tradition of St. Cyril of Alexandria who does at times in the Council of Ephesus speak of Christ possessing a unified ""physis"" (nature) so as to avoid a confusion like Nestorianism, which would separate Christ's human nature and divine nature and would thus render Christ's human nature unworthy of worship, which would be complete heresy. The primary reason for their rejection of Chalcedon was mainly over misunderstandings that it bent too close to Nestorius's teachings and also for decisions concerning the excommunicating and reinstatement of certain clergymen that the Oriental Churches did not agree with.",OrthodoxChristianity

We live in a corrupted world that is filled with frauds and evil. Isn't it natural for people to become suspicious of people? If it is natural for people to get suspicious, why He allows other religions and traditions to spread? 


Why I have to follow what the church says when the church changes opinions and cant prove that what it says is real or valid. So, why I have to follow the difficult path of Christian when it cant be proved that it is the right way?


Everyone claims that their religion is the right one. Many people believe that being a Muslim is the right way. Christians think that they are deluded. What if Muslims are right and Christians are wrong? What if all are wrong?

Anyone familiar with doing confession after taking communion?,bitnil,1621797103,"Hi everyone,

So long story short, I went to church today (I moved parishes due to restrictions and stuff). I called the priest in advance and told him I wanted to have confession an communion.

It turns out he didn't have time to hear my confession before the liturgy, so I decided I wouldn't take communion, and did not approach the communion line. Then the priest called my name across the church, ""Come now"" referring to communion, ""We'll do the confession after the liturgy"".

 It was very weird for me, but I figured the priest knew what we was doing, so I went up and took communion when he called me, and when the Liturgy was over he called me again and we did the confession.

*On a separate a couple years back*, another priest at another parish under the same bishop did the same thing with me - he gave me communion first, and confession after.

Anyone knows how common doing this is? It doesn't seem like a usual practice to me, but again I don't know everything.

Layman Exorcism,HipnotistaDeEsquina,1621783677,"This is both a question and a prayer request.

I have a cousin (8 years old) who has always behaved aggressively and been very disobedient, but lately he's been his mother's sheer terror and misery.

Yes, there are some very mundane reasons for his behaviour. His family situation is pure chaos. He and his brother (5 years old) live with their mother, but their father constantly uses his influence on them to blackmail and humiliate their mother. The younger one is pretty normal, but the older one apparently nurishes a very strong feeling of resent and even hate towards his mom, which his father apparently takes advantage of to torment his ex-wife even more.

To top it off, the mother doesn't seem to impose any authority and respect whatsoever. She'll often accept her own children's abuse and do whatever they want just to have a brief moment of piece. This abuse can take many forms, but today it took to another level. 

The kid just kept throwing things at her and laughing almost demonically. He's here at the house I'm in right now as his mother sent him over because she wasn't being able to control him. It's not even the first time she's done that. He sometimes seems to enjoy her suffering.

Our grandmother has lately been suspecting that he's under some kind of demonic influence. She's told stories of similar situations that happened to acquaintances of hers which were solved through Church rituals. She's a very devout Catholic and is trying to convince her daughter to take her child to see a priest. I didn't believe it at first, but now it's starting to make sense.

Oddly enough, he behaves normally when he's not around his mother. An hour ago, I had him sit on a chair, put my hands over his had and prayed to God for any evil entity that's manipulating him to live him alone. I did the sign of the cross on me and on his forehead and let him go.

That's about as much as I can do with the knowledge I have. I'm not Orthodox (not yet at least) and I don't know what else I can do. There are several reasons why I can't just take the kid to an Orthodox priest. It'll be a Catholic one if he does indeed end up seeing one, which I sure hope he does.

I'm looking for prayers, specific rituals and whatnot which I can do to help him as a lay person. I also urge you to pray for him and everyone else who is currently being possessed. May God bless you all.",OrthodoxChristianity

I've never been much of a pray-er and understand this is one facet I can improve upon using this Orthodox journey. 

Since I've never really done focused prayer before, I need some help here - how do you do your morning and evening prayers? I think I'd like to set up a little corner in my basement as a place I can retreat to for quiet in the morning and evening. If you have a place for prayer, did you adorn it with anything? Icons seem like something I should wait for as a gift (especially if I begin the process of converting) but having one to focus on while praying might be beneficial. I definitely enjoy the incense from the liturgy and would want to add that to my area along with a candle. I feel like I can still smell the incense from the divine liturgy on Friday which is pretty amazing. 

I've also seen a bunch of different morning and evening prayers so not really sure how to 'choose' one.

Bishop Teodosije: Serbian shrines - Serbian wealth,AvailableHearing,1621688715,"Serbian shrines in Kosovo and Metohija are Serbian cultural and religious wealth and will remain so, it is paradoxical that others are appropriating them, said His Eminence Bishop Teodosije of Raska and Prizren.

We are witnesses that today others are appropriating our temples, and they do that only because they do not have their own. They are trying to show the world that they also have culture - Bishop Teodosije pointed out, reacting to Pristina's request that Serbian shrines in Kosovo and Metohija be removed from the list of endangered monasteries and that Serbian religious heritage be inscribed as the cultural heritage of self-proclaimed Kosovo.

The bishop said that the doors of churches and monasteries are open to everyone who wants to pray to God, that Serbs do not adopt them, but that everyone must know that they are Serbian temples.

\- They must know that the Church of St. Nicholas in Pristina, Visoki Decani, Gracanica, the Patriarchate of Peja, Devic and other our churches have a history and their own identity. It is known who erected them and why he erected them - not so that they would be just monuments, so that someone would brag about them, their beauty and greatness, but so that they would be a home of prayer - Bishop Teodosije emphasized.

In a sermon in the Church of St. Nicholas in Pristina, he pointed out that Serbs are not afraid of what someone is saying unfoundedly, because all the writings say and testify that Serbian temples were, are and will remain so.

This morning, the Bishop served on the occasion of the celebration of the Church of St. Nicholas in Pristina - the transfer of the relics of Holy Father Nikolaj, this morning he served with the concelebration of the monks and priests of the Diocese of Raska and Prizren.

This is the first Holy Hierarch's Liturgy served in this temple since the beginning of the outbreak of the coronavirus.

Having previously blessed and congratulated the faithful, Bishop Teodosije pointed out that their presence in large numbers today in all Serbian churches and monasteries in Kosovo and Metohija is a confirmation that Serbs are alive and do not give up their saints and faith, led by saints and their gratitude.

The worship service was also attended by about fifty displaced Serbs from central Serbia and a representative of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, and an increased number was provided by the Kosovo Police Service.",OrthodoxChristianity

Paul on Marriage; What does he mean for love?,FrederikSibbern,1621671226,"Hey friends, I have a somewhat complicated inquiry, but I would appreciate everyone's thoughts on it.  

In the Paul's letter to the Corinthians, he (quite famously, I'd say) remarks: ""Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.""

I find this passage fascinating because it's one of the only situations that I can recall a church practice described as having something fundamentally oppositional in its essence.  Paul is saying here ""The point of marriage is so that you do not burn with passion,"" not ""The point of marriage is to bring you closer to God.""  To me, this framing sounds similar to saying, ""The point of confession is so that you do not go to Hell, not to absolve yourself before God."" I see a difference between these two things; but is there really one?

Wrapped up in all of this is, of course, the modern concept of love as well.  In the context of this passage, it sounds to me like the ""True Love"" that gets thrown around in pop culture and friendly conversation nowadays is just as much of a distraction from God as any other common vice.  Maybe even Miyazaki Hayao's aphorism of the closer depiction of true love being ""mutual inspiration to live"" is simply another temptation. Maybe making everything black and white isn't helpful, though.  

I won't try to write an exegesis on reddit, and I do recognize that taking a biblical quote out of context brings with it certain risks.  Nevertheless, I can't help but feel completely lost when trying to apply these sorts of ideas in my life.  Facing them scares me too¬†‚Äì¬†I can see how they can very easily lead to the sort of dark asceticism that rejects anything non-Orthodox simply because it isn't.  I want to believe that the discovery of ""True Love"" in the modern day is an extension of God's grace to us; I want to believe that marriage is a ""Good"" thing, not just the absence of a bad one.  I just don't know, and realizing that feels about as earth shaking as forgetting how to breathe must be.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear all of your thoughts, though I would like to humbly request anything non-exegetical be presented as inquiry rather than judgement.

Would it be offensive for me to take my family to our local Antiochian Church Mon-Sat (and Sundays we can't make it out of town) in order to embrace the Eastern life fully, throughout the week?  Do you feel it disingenuous or dishonest to participate in the life of the community with having no active interest or intention on converting into Eastern Orthodoxy?

We've been at the parish many times and I've no doubt the community would continue welcoming us.  But we haven't gone in a couple months now, and if we return and Father eventually gets around to asking about our conversion, and I tell him we're not interested anymore, I wouldn't want to cause scandal for anyone.

Also, I hope it goes without saying that we wouln't try to receive Holy Communion at the Orthodox Church (nor would we be permitted to).  

TLDR: Was interested in becoming Orthodox.  My wife wasn't.  Many difficult months of praying and reading and I finally accept that Eastern Catholicism is where my family belongs.  The question boils down to this: Is it bad for an Eastern Catholic who isn't going to become Orthodox, to take his family regularly/daily to an Orthodox Church to particpate in the communal life of the parish (vespers, orthros, occasional Sunday Divine Liturgies, etc)?  Or is it scandalous because we aren't Orthodox and have no intention at the moment of converting?

Alien Sentience and Orthodoxy,ValueForm,1621513923,"I‚Äôve often wondered how the faith would respond to the discovery of sentient life outside of Earth. We know that Christ‚Äôs victory saved the whole cosmos, and that reports of UFOs and the like may simply be cases of demonic interference. But let‚Äôs just imagine that someday, we discover or come into contact with sentient alien life.

If there are sentient aliens, what would that mean for the idea that man is created in the image of God? It seems that this idea lends itself to a certain anthropocentrism. But if aliens were to have their own rich histories, cultures, etc. it would seem suspicious to draw a line and say that only man is created in the image of God. Could we accept that we are not alone in being created in the image of God? Or would this constitute a major problem for the faith?

Now imagine that these aliens have their own religious traditions, or perhaps even a messianic figure in their history. Isn‚Äôt it possible this could challenge the notion of human beings as the ‚Äúprotagonists‚Äù of creation? If their ‚ÄúChrist‚Äù figure appeared very similar to our own, could that suggest that God has revealed Himself to created things other than humanity? On the other hand, if Christ redeemed the whole of the cosmos on Earth, would that suggest that their messianic figures are simply false, redeeming nothing in particular? 

I think it‚Äôs an important question, because if God chose to save the cosmos through humanity‚Äôs history alone, once and for all, that suggests that Earth and mankind remain ‚Äúspecial‚Äù in some way that all other planets and species are not. 

Obviously these are simply speculative questions, as we know of no sentient alien life. But given the vastness of the cosmos, along with our developing knowledge of it, it seems that alien life is a serious potential that we may encounter someday. 
 
Has anybody written on what it would mean for the faith to encounter sentient alien life? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a moot question just because we haven‚Äôt discovered such life yet. We know that God is the creator, but after meeting aliens, could we still consider man the protagonist of His creation? Or would this likely require radical rethinking?",OrthodoxChristianity

My biggest problem with christianity. Christian perspective. Can non christians achieve salvation?,vtf556,1621482697,"Hey, it's me again. :) Now i want to focus on christian exclusivism, belief that only christians who consciously accept Jesus can achieve salvation. If i were an atheist, this would be my biggest problem with christianity for sure. I think a lot of christians don' t understand what this view of salvation implies. More than 5 bilion people who are alive atm will suffer for etetnity, most of them didnt choose their religion bit they were born on different culture or country. What about those who have never heard the gospel, what about other religions, what about people before Jesus,what about atheists who didnt have enough informationma, many pf them didnt reject christian faith but some fundamentalist interpretation of it? Will they all go to hell for eternity? ETERNITY, forever, suffering for eternity, becauss they didnt have enough information. Ask yourself for a moment, if this is true, is God  really just and equivalent for love? In my mind exclusivism seems really really implausible. What about inclusivism or even universalism? Romans 2 teaches(if i understand correctly) that people who didnt have enough information wont be judged by the law but by the information they had. That seems plausible to me, and more in align with God's nature. Also Jesus himself in Matthew 25 31-46 talks about how salvation can be achieved even if you ""didnt know Jesus"" during your earthly life"". Maybe nonchristians can be in a relationship with God when they act like Jesus. That's why Jesus said if you helped my brothers, you helped me, if you fed them, you fed me. Maybe you can be in a relationship with Jesus even if you are not aware of that, like a relationship and conection beetween mother and a baby in mother's womb. Also what about atheists, can they achieve salvation by God's grace. I think this question is more difficult than most people think and simply saying all nonchristians will suffer forvever is not satisfying and not fair.

What happened to the dead who rose with Christ?,Public-Heretic,1621369314,"Matthew 27:50-53:

&gt;And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.¬†Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split,¬†and the graves were opened; *and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;¬†and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.**

Matthew makes a rather bombastic claim - not only Jesus but even other people rose from the dead on Sunday morning. One can guess why only Matthew would record this tradition: after all this would have happened during the feast, and although they ""appeared to many"", in reality Jerusalem was crowded with Jews from all places and so those risen dead wouldn't have necessarily stood out... except for maybe being naked, or wearing unusual clothes, who knows... It's not clear how many rose from the dead either. It seems to be a literal fulfillment of the prophecy of dry bones in Ezekiel, in any case. 

- Who are ""the saints""? The followers of Jesus who died during His ministry? The Old Testament righteous? If the latter, is anyone in particular intended, like certain biblical characters or Jews from a certain era?

- What happened to them afterward? Did they have normal bodies and live as normal people and die again? Did they have spiritual bodies and ascend to the Father with Christ? If the latter, I thought St Mary being the only risen and assumed person so far beside Christ was why she holds such a special status...

- Isn't it a little... big? In 1 Corinthians Paul has to defend that the risen Christ was indeed seen several times, and by many people, and that some who saw Him are still alive to testify for it. But in Matthew we see something even more incredible than the risen Christ - the resurrection of many people.

Confused about confession,SirDoucheFace,1621355557,"What is confession exactly in the orthodox church? Whenever I come to this sub there is always a post relating to confession being very important. But I was raised as an orthodox christian in Serbia and I have never heard about people going to confession not even once, I thought that was only a catholic thing since childhood. The only thing that I have heard people call confession is when you go to liturgy to take rhe eucharist, there is a room inside my church where there is a priest and before you receive the eucharist you go into that room, the priest puts cloth over your head, recites a prayer and then you leave some donation money on the icon infront of you; is this what everyone here is talking about when they mention confession? Because from what I understood people here are talking about it like I have seen in movies where people go in thoae booths with a catholic priest in it and then they confess their sins.

How bad of an idea would it be to get a religious tattoo if my priest is against them? (Orthodox newbie),Feeling-Meaning,1621300095,"Howdy folks, just an inquirer here. I've only been to one service but really liked the experience and intend to follow through with the process of becoming orthodox. I'm very lacking on orthodox etiquette and everything so I'm just wondering about this issue. I know that there is not an official church doctrine on tattoos, and that many people are completely fine with them, and others are very against them. So since it is not an actual doctrinal issue, do I *have* to follow my priests advice on it or is it more of just a recommendation? Or if I went against his recommendation would I possibly get into actual trouble for it even though it's not official doctrine? I know the answer on this sub is more often than not ""ask your priest"" on many issues but I haven't quite gotten to the point of having deep conversations with him yet since I've only met him once, but this has just been on my mind for a while so was wondering about it.

The tattoos that I've really been wanting is the name Lazarus in Greek as well as a Coptic cross on my wrist. I've wanted a Lazarus tattoo pretty much ever since I have started to come back to Christianity. There is a poem by G K Chesterton called ""Lazarus"" where the basic jist of the poem is something along the lines of ""I have seen and heard everything that this world has to offer. All of the twists and turns on the maps made by the wisest men of all the ages. But all of this is dust to me. Because I am Lazarus and I live"". This poem hit me really hard and was virtually the beginning of my homecoming to Christianity. Also, ever since I had heard the creed for the first time I have found the last lines of ""I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come"" super explosive and just really like to think on the idea and all. And for obvious reasons I feel close ties with that line and the story of Lazarus. Plus the first thing that made me love orthodoxy is finding out that Lazarus story *continues* after his fifteen seconds of Fame in the bible. It was just really eye opening to me about the whole history of the church and how the story has continued even though it's not within the pages of the bible (I've been a pretty hardcore Sola scriptura protestant all of my life)

With the Coptic cross, I basically just love the history and the story behind it and would love to feel like a part of it. I just really look up to the individuals who have it and love the history, tradition, and meaning behind it. I think it would be a great constant reminder for me and all of that.

So pretty much, is it an end game thing with tattoos if my priest ends up saying no he doesn't like tattoos? If I really feel that strongly about it, could I possibly just get one or both before I join/start the catechumen process? 

This definitely isn't going to stop me from wanting to join or anything. If everyone says that it's very stupid to go against your priest and is ill of me to try to get it done before I officially join I don't think I would go through with getting them done. I guess I would just like to hear that be said if that's the case so I can just give it up and move on",OrthodoxChristianity

Contraceptive Use,Sedentary_Longjumper,1621273736,"Hello everyone,

I want to start by saying thank you so much, this will most likely be a long post but I would be very grateful if you could help answer my questions. 

My husband and I are new Orthodox converts from Baptist. We are very excited about this change but have very little knowledge of Orthodox teaching. I have been reading online (mainly the OCA website) and watching a LOT of Orthodox media on Youtube, but I still have many questions.

Our concerns about contraceptive use actually come before the start of our Orthodox journey. I've always felt strange taking them, thinking that they were hurting me in some way (physically or mentally) but I could never find scientific evidence supporting any negative effects of long-term hormonal birth control use. And my husband would always ask me from time to time if I felt mentally and physically okay while taking them. 
I've been taking them for so long I honestly have no idea if they actually affect me or if my mental and physical changes are just from maturing.

I've recently learned the Orthodox church condemns the use of contraceptives and preventing birth in any way is condemned except
 ""when the birth of a child will bring danger and hardship"".

My husband and I agreed on using hormonal contraceptives for a few reasons:
We never felt financial stable enough to support a child
We live in a small apartment that we feel would not be a good environment for a child to grow up in
We have both battled bouts of deep depression, anxiety, and much emotional struggle and we do not believe in our current emotional state we could give a child the love and care it deserves

My questions about all of this would be: 
What does ""danger and hardship"" mean? 
How has the church traditionally treated situations where a man and wife would be unable to support a child (mentally or physically)?
Would abstaining from sexual union to prevent a child for a period of time be condemned?

I want to mention that my husband and I do want a child in the future, but we are unsure of when that time would be. 

I appreciate any response, thank you so much for your time.",OrthodoxChristianity

As a child my parents divorced. My father was abusive and despite that my mom tried her hardest to make it work, begging for counseling with the church etc. But it just did not. I went to church pretty regularly until I was 8 or 9. The community at the particular church I was at was a bit judgmental of the divorce and I remember feeling very weird being the only kid without a father around.

Restrictions on already restricted eating ended up badly. I get OCD, I have become more underweight (from about 18.4 even to 16.0; now 17.4), I get even serious anaemia.

Eastern Orthodox priests told me fasting should not be so devastating etc. and they said I should not fast. But it is not easy now to eat a little bit more normally. **It would be better not to start fasting.**

[CW: abusive relationship] Will my priest let me get divorced and someday remarry?,rupiodszj,1621136308,"Hi. Obvs the answer is ""ask your priest."" We have been in close communication this whole time, but I've never outright asked, because I'm afraid of the answer. So I would like to hear it here, to soften the blow if necessary, so I can have the uncomfortable conversation with him soon.

My husband and I have been married 5 years, 3 kids, separated and living apart almost 1 year. We honestly had a rough go of it right from the start. I'm divorced once before, from when I was a 19 year old bride, before I was Orthodox. That marriage was to a good man, but I went through a period of depression and we were unable to see eye to eye. He left it against my wishes and after I had made every effort to keep it together. If it were up to me, we would have stayed married and worked through it. 

**Adultery:** My current estranged husband has gone to massage parlor prostitutes for sexual favors less than a year into our marriage. He admitted to doing this 8 times. He also has an ongoing problem/addiction to pornography and masturbation. I tried to forgive him, but since I found out, things have never been the same. 

**Substance Abuse:** He is well and truly addicted to marijuana and smokes it every day despite my strong opposition, no matter how much debt we have or how little is in the bank. Every year, his New Year's resolution is to quit. He sometimes goes to addiction groups and then smokes afterwards. When we were dating, he had quit and I thought this change would be permanent, but he went back to it as soon as we were married. 

**Financial Abuse:** He has lost about a dozen jobs in the time we've been married, due to no-shows and underperforming. Much of this time he was ditching work to smoke marijuana. He lost a job with good benefits while I was 36 weeks pregnant, losing our health coverage and causing a very stressful last-minute search for a doctor who would accept public health insurance and ""let"" me try a VBAC. He is also constantly investing in expensive online courses that don't pan out, over my objections. When I was a SAHM, he held it over my head that all the money was in his name. 

**Physical Abuse:** There has been violence in our relationship. Admittedly, I've snapped back at him too, but not to the same degree. He was charged with domestic violence for throwing me against a wall while pregnant and pled guilty early in our relationship, after he moved back in after the cheating. He's afraid of jail now, but still would hide or break my things instead of hurting me directly. He's thrown things at me and slapped me in front of the kids. He put his hands around my throat to strangle me but then thought better of it and let go. Shouting crude insults at me or going days refusing to speak to me were also on regular rotation. 

When asked, he'll talk about how I'm so angry and controlling. But I don't think that's my nature. It's more a reaction to what I've been through. I don't know if that matters to the *oikonomia* of the situation.

At this point I don't care if I ever remarry, but I want to know if it will someday be a possibility. If not, OK. I probably don't even want to anyway. More importantly, will I be allowed to make a clean break, or will I have to live in the limbo of legal separation forever?

He's Orthodox too, though I think it's been a very long time since he's confessed or partaken of the Eucharist. We were received as a family two years ago, and that might've been the last time. I'm not privy to the details, but there's something about if he's actively using marijuana, he can't commune. So he chooses the marijuana instead. He wants to go to church as a family even though we're separated and I just can't stand it. I've been going to a different Orthodox church, because he's obviously very broken and I don't want to take him away from the church community he knows if it's something that will help him. It's so awkward being Orthodox, both wanting to go to church, and going through a separation. This is so difficult and I want to be able to envision how it might resolve.",OrthodoxChristianity

Some questions if I may?,Potato-1942,1621046020,"Hello!  I have some questions about the Orthodox Church, and I feel I have reached the limit of what I can research on my own, so I was hoping this sub could lend some clarity on a few things?  

First, my background, as it may be of some help.  I was raised American ""nondenominational"", which at this point I now recognize as it's own branch of protestantism.  A few years back, I decided that I needed to be able to back up my beliefs, and that if I couldn't back them up, I wouldn't hold to them.  This led to some in depth study of scripture, far more in depth than any of the churches I have hereforth visited.  As a result of these in depth studies, I discovered much of what I had been taught didn't align with scripture when taken in context.  

As a result of my aforementioned studies, I began looking for a church that taught scripture in context and with an originalist understanding.  That search has led me to considering the Orthodox Church, as what I have found so far aligns best with my understanding of scripture in an originalist context.  

Now for my remaining questions

1.  I understand that the Orthodox Church considers itself the only church.  Does this mean the Orthodox view is that people who seek after Christ, but never have any interaction with the Orthodox church are not saved?  

A couple examples to make my question clear.  

First, let's say someone in Iran for instance, receives a dream of Christ, and chooses to seek after Him and call Him Lord, faithfully seeking communion with Christ for the remainder of their life, but they die never even meeting another Christian, would  they be granted salvation?  

Second, an individual who grows up in the 19th century American west.  Their only exposure to Christianity their entire life is through a local protestant church.  Would they be saved?  As a twist on this one, what about someone who lives in a modern setting, and is aware of the Orthodox church, but chooses to stay with a protestant church?

2.  Is what many would consider God moving outside the Orthodox church considered an actual action of the Holy Spirit, or are only revelations and conversions within the Orthodox church considered genuine works of the Lord?

3.  If someone seeks the Lord faithfully, but is never baptized, can they receive salvation?  (This loops back to my hypothetical Christian in Iran scenario too)

4.  How important are hierarchalism and ritualism?  Or, I guess what I'm getting at is where is the line between dogma/required beliefs within the Orthodox church, and what is considered more colloquial?  This extends further, as I am also wondering if disagreement with minor points within church decisions or ecumenical councils is considered blasphemous, or merely a disagreement?  

5.  For visiting an Orthodox church, what is a typical standard of dress, and are there any particulars I should be aware of beforehand in order to avoid a faux pas?

"As a Christian, is it okay to sue?",EGYQueen143,1621034834,"Hello all,

Just looking for an honest Christian opinion. I went to this dentist after staying away for a long time and was told I would need two crowns and a root canal and that I needed to pay upfront. I paid her approximately $1200 and she has not completed either crown for me. I went to a different dentist, who stated that I would not need a root canal. Fast-forward 3 months later, I have yet to hear back from the first dentist regarding a refund for at least one of the crowns.

The dilemma I am facing here is I do not know if it is ethical/moral for me to file a claim in court to get my money back for services not rendered. If this was a couple hundred, I would've never thought about it. I have contacted her many times and requested the insurance company take a look but they stated it would take months to even get a response.

David's murdered, Paul murdered, peter cut a guys ear off, the Levites were made Levites because they killed sinners, the list goes on and on. So if that is the case then why could a killer not become clergy in today's time? Also, no matter the sin, aren't we all washed white as snow?

How to have an Orthodox wedding?,Ringbring,1620883344,"Hi there! I've been doing some research on this topic but just thought it would be helpful to hear other peoples' thoughts.

When my fianc√© and I got engaged he was still struggling with whether he wanted to be Catholic or Orthodox (I was raised Catholic, although not very strictly, and he grew up atheist). Because of this we decided to start planning a secular wedding so we could be married in some since of the word and have a celebration with our families, then have the marriage recognized by the faith we decided on. Another fact that contributed to this is that my fianc√© will have to travel for work on and off for the next 6 months to a year and we weren't sure we'd be able to be accepted by a certain church if he can't attend the same one regularly.

Now my fianc√© is certain he wants to be Orthodox, and I agreed to convert as well. We've been planning to have our wedding a year from now. Would we be able to convert and go through any marriage classes we need in that amount of time? Does my fianc√© need to be physically present for any of this or could he do it over the internet when he is out of the state? Lastly, the venue we booked has an outside ceremony space. We picked this because we have some relatives that are deathly afraid of Covid and said they would be more comfortable with an outside wedding. Is there anyway to get an exception and have the wedding at a venue like this or must it be in a church? If this isn't an option, could we have a small religious ceremony in a church then have something like what I'm describing the next day so the rest of our family can participate?

I believe he supports same sex marriage, transgender ideology, stating that Hell isn't real, saying atheists can go to heaven and more. I also think there is a theological issue, but obviously I'm not well versed in the topic to talk about it. I'm just clowned on by everyone and I understand why. How can a Catholic who vowed to support the Pope, not support the Pope? My relationship with God has been super shaky. I was baptized as a baby. I went to church, but not frequently. I started becoming an atheist. I started going to Church more when I was in 8th to 9th grade and stopped after I entered 10th grade because of the distance. During that time, I received communion. Granted I wasn't trying my best in communion class as I had to wake up extra early and I was tired because of the drive. But I think that's acceptable for a 14 or 15 year old kid. So I can't even call myself a real Catholic. I have never read the Bible. The farthest I got was when Abraham left for the promised land. That's like a couple of pages. I just can't find myself to read it. Maybe because I don't want to read it and always push it off to indulge in whatever I want to do. I also don't have ""time"". I'm either studying, doing my homework, or participating in free time. I don't know if I should just give up on denominations and just read the Bible or if I should just stop altogether.

What if I do not fast? I  think there is not a verse in the Bible about commiting a sin if we do not fast Friday and Wednesday.

I think some Christians consider it a sin because the church says so. But some Christians have even more strict rules. For example, a monk rejected a gift of bed sheets because it had flowers on them and considered it too prideful.

Some bg before I ask : last month I had the worst faith crisis of my life. Today I'm doing much better, praise God, literally nothing short of a miracle. But some lingering thoughts still haven't been resolved.

Lots of people (cs Lewis included) have stressed that humanity's desire for Divinity strongly suggests Divinity's existence. But how can we know its not a byproduct of our development? I've heard, a couple times but idk how much truth there is to it, that some elephants have started to worship during certain moon phases. I admit that could be used either way, but it made me uneasy and kinda sparked this thought (indirectly)
I'm familar with people that also stress humanities use of symbolism infer to a general/universal experince with spiritual beings, but it goes back to the same question for me, of how can we know human experiences are reliable and that we aren't simply fooling ourselves because of some odd evolutionary quirk/other developmental influences? Simply flipping this on its head isn't enough for me to dismiss it entirely.

How to identify opportunistic demonic entities?,Iraelia18,1620791798,"This is something that has always interested me. I've had a longstanding rule with the occult that either two things are happening:

1) It's fake and doing it is a waste of time.

2) It's real and you're contacting demons.

From this I've created a hardline rule of staying away from the occult, seances, fortune tellers, reaching out to ""ghosts,"" etc.

But I've never really learned about the ways in which Orthodox Christians have historically identified opportunistic entities and combatted them. I know in the Catholic Church they have lots of complex rules and regulations pertaining to how to identify whether a visitation is holy or demonic in nature. I've always assumed the Orthodox Church mostly rejected these, as the Orthodox Church tends to reject those aspects of Catholicism which are arbitrarily legalistic (see: the Catholic accounting of sin, distinction between mortal or venial sins, etc.). But that raises the question for me: Does the Orthodox Church have ways in which they identify and sort out demonic entities from angelic visitation or potential Marian/saintly apparitions? If so, what are they?

This isn't a practical concern, I'm just curious as to what the Church thinks about this.",OrthodoxChristianity

On the scale, we see vertical lines everywhere. These are exits into eternity. And time is open for a Christian. History is a person's movement from eternity, before his time, his historical time, to eternity after this time. There is a famous expression: 'History is a way from eternity to eternity.' So when man was created, there was no time. Time appeared after the Fall. God gave man time. Time is finiteness. And finiteness is death. So, therefore, speaking about the meaning of life, we cannot do without the meaning of death, and hence, without time. So the gift to mankind was time and death after the Fall.""

I don't think Orthodox Christians should have a problem with Original Sin. Thoughts?,md259,1620701260,"From my understanding, Orthodox Christians reject the Catholic view of Original Sin because it implies that we inherit Adam's guilt. But this is a serious straw man.

Catholics DO NOT believe that we are personally guilty of Adam's sin. Rather, we inherit Adam's fallen state of being: a state deprived of the indwelling of the Holy Trinity. And from this flow death, corruption, darkness, inclination to sin, and susceptibility to demonic influence.

This is the current teaching, found in [Catechism of the Catholic Church](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/405.htm). And the Catholic Church [never taught](https://taylormarshall.com/2011/07/does-original-sin-guilty-babies.html) inherited guilt at any point in the past, even though inaccurate translations of the Council of Trent might give that impression.

My hope is to clear up that misunderstanding. With this clarification, could you accept, or at least not reject, the Catholic view of Original Sin?

Here is an article from an Orthodox perspective saying basically that Orthodoxy should not have a problem with Original Sin, properly understood: [The Ecumenical Stain of Original Sin](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2019/06/05/the-ecumenical-stain-of-original-sin-2/), By Fr Aidan Kimel.

Trinity and Servants,No-Enthusiasm-9657,1620688062,"hiya, i was studying some Trinity stuff the other day and a question came to mind that i havent found an answer for yet so i figured id ask here! please forgive me if this is worded bad, its hard to explain.

in the gospels of st Luke and st Matthew when recounting the faith of the centurion, one says it was the master himself who went to Jesus, and the other says it was the masters friends/servants, ive come to understand this as meaning that in the cultural context the ones who came in the name of the centurion was acting as if they were the centurion.

likewise, i think we see examples of this in the old testament directly in relation to God and His angels, although i admit there's debate there (atleast in the tradition i grew up in) so i wont go into it.

basically my question is, how can we be sure that isn't what Jesus is doing but that Jesus is truly God and God is triune? did the early church fathers have anything to say about this? i realize this is heresy and it isn't a belief i hold, but id really like an answer so it doesnt bother me anymore.. thank you in advance!",OrthodoxChristianity

Bitterness and resentment,Chatechized,1620652575,"Before anything, I know this is an ""ask your priest"" conversation but there are limitations as to why I can't go to my priest just yet. 





I have a few people in my life, but one in particular (my spouse) who has offended, harmed, and wounded me for years such to the point that I have realized I have become deeply bitter, resentful, and greatly dislike her and being around her and at best, can labor to cook, clean, pay for, take care of, and occasionally talk to but we're basically bitter roommates at this point. I've realized much of this is that we are both trying to bring healing to the relationship, but at different times, in different ways, and we reject each other's efforts because of our bitterness which causes us to become more bitter and encourages us to become angry and start new arguments.








We've been going to counseling for almost 2 years now, but had a very long bout of absence during COVID because I lost my job and we couldn't afford it, and then again right before Christmas because we couldn't find time so our first trip back was last week. I can't say we've made a ton of progress but I guess any is better than none.








I've confessed my bitterness to the Lord but since I'm not received into the Church yet - partly because my wife despises Orthodoxy and resents me for even pursuing it (her words) - I have yet to do so to anyone else besides her and my own therapist. As I posted in the general chat a week or so ago, we also have no friends at all in this city. So we're pretty alone.











I pray for her good and wellbeing every day, find things to like and compliment her on, pray that I would no longer be bitter, and ask for the Theotokos and other saints. I pray the Jesus Pray constantly and slowly. And so far, still, it's nothing but more fights and fights and anger and yelling and fights. I can't bring myself to not be angry at being genuinely wounded, especially considering that there are new wounds nearly every day.






To top it all off, there are some people I genuinely hate and despise. People I wish ill on, and pray to never meet. People who I find revolting and despicable, and while I know this is sin and keeping me from being forgiven, I can't get rid of it.







Soon I will ask my priest on his advice but his time is very limited, we don't know anyone else, and I'm not even a member of the Church. Are there any books or prayers or anything at all that can help with this? How does one stop hating and stop being resentful and bitter without becoming a doormat, making up reasons to apologize when there are none, and excusing the real harm others do to you? My wife's father is like this and his marriage is in absolute shambles because he doesn't respect himself and lets his wife walk all over him and show open and active disdain for him in front of others and mock him or degrade him, and he apologizes to her for it. That's *not* how I want my marriage or my life to be. But I don't know how to do that and still reject bitterness and resentment of the evil done to me.

Acceptance by Baptism?,Iraelia18,1620599538,"I'm a catechumen studying to be Orthodox and I have some questions about acceptance by Baptism.

I was baptized in infancy, in the name of the trinity. I was baptized at my Grandfather's old farm house by a pastor who had served our family for my grandfather's entire life. It was a Lutheran baptism, but so far as I understand the form and intent is present, just not the content of a ""perfect"" baptism.

Nevertheless, I don't think I want to be re-baptized. My family's history is special to me and I do think God was present in the ceremony, if not as perfectly had it been conducted in the rituals and manner of the church. Most sources I've heard from on Orthodoxy are fine with this, as all trinitarian baptisms can be accepted (this excludes the Restorationist churches for their Arian heresy).

But I went to an OCA church, different from the one I usually intend, and got a far more conservative response from this priest. He said that the form and intent are recognized, but the importance of the content is essential in salvation, and said he personally only accepts Catholics by Chrism, and everyone else he accepts by Baptism.

Personally, I'm not so worried about ""getting"" accepted by Chrism, my regular priest would be fine with it, but I'm starting to feel concern for the state of my soul. If the content of the Orthodox Baptism is so important that non-Orthodox baptisms don't count, what does that say of my baptism? If I'm accepted by Chrism, will my baptism matter in the eyes of the Lord? What does that entail for the state of my soul?

Can anyone offer any perspectives on this? It's got me kind of worried.",OrthodoxChristianity

"I'm interested in Orthodoxy, but I feel conflicted about something",throwaway89314,1620487473,"**I've already marked this as NSFW. But this is my extra warning because I'm going to delve into a triggering topic that deals with sexuality.**

To put this mildly, I feel like I'm torn between two worlds. I've been interested in the Orthodox Church and religion in general for quite a while now. But the thing that makes me hesitant is my intuition that a lot of religion is hung up on sexuality and the repression of perfectly natural desires. Like, I feel like so much of religion is fueled by fear, especially through sexual shaming and believing that you will burn in hell for eternity if you so much as touch your private area.

But there is something in particular that makes me uneasy about committing to religion. It's that I am, I guess you could say, a little kinky (this is where my warning is most applicable and why I'm using a throwaway account). I don't like hurting people or being hurt, but I've always enjoyed being tied up and tying someone else up for erotic pleasure. I've always felt this way, and it's not linked to any trauma. And I would never, EVER do this without the other party's consent. But if religious people knew this about me, I think they would label me as a perverted degenerate who belongs in the most torturous pits of hell.

For so long I tried to deny this part of me. I felt so ashamed for enjoying bondage. The shame grew even more when I became a Roman Catholic. I just wanted to be ""pure"" and ""clean"". At certain point I became exhausted with putting up a facade of self righteousness and accepted this kinky side of me. I realized that everyone has a way of connecting with the primal, dark side of being human (which is why so many people get into fighting sports and skydiving). When I talked to one of my friends about this, he assured me that my feelings are pretty normal and that a lot of well-adjusted and normal people have the same feelings as me. In other words, I shouldn't feel ashamed. After all, I enjoy it and I'm not hurting anyone.

So if I wanted to be an Orthodox Christian, which is something I've been interested in for a while, I'd have to address this part of me. Because if I'm not mistaken, the Church would consider this type of behavior as unacceptable and sinful, even though I had no choice in having this kink. I can't just give this up or make it disappear. It's not like it defines me: it's only a small, yet intimate, part of my personality. I know I could just attend Liturgy without ever receiving the Eucharist or going to Confession. But would that really make me an Orthodox Christian?

And why would an all-loving God willingly allow people to burn in Hell (a place that He created) just for having sex that is outside of vanilla, procreative sex within the confines of marriage? And if God is able and also desires to save all men (1 Timothy 2:4), but still lets fall into the torments of Hell, is He really all-powerful and all-loving as the Church claims?

Don't get me wrong, I'm still interested in Orthodoxy. Maybe you could call me an inquirer. I have the intuition that the Orthodox Church is the Church that Christ founded, and that it is far more similar to the Church of the first millennium than the Roman Catholic Church. But I wish I didn't have to feel ashamed for this erotic side of me that I didn't choose. After all, it's safe to assume that the eradication of sexual thoughts and feelings is a herculean, nigh impossible, task and only for monks, nuns, and clergy.

I know this is a lot, and I'm glad that you've read it. And I know it's a bit of a serious and uncomfortable topic. But if you could share some advice, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance.",OrthodoxChristianity

Please wear a mask in church.,thephotoman,1620421310,"During Holy Week, my parish became a superspreader event.  We have currently had 4 diagnosed cases of the rona that definitely happened during that time.  

Very few people in my parish bother to wear a mask during service.  While you aren't going to get COVID from the chalice, you *can* get it from standing in church.  You *can* spread it by not wearing a mask in church, or by going to church while symptomatic (or even exposed).  I don't care that it was Holy Week or Easter.  Whomever came and exposed the whole parish to the virus actively showed spite to their fellow man.  

If you won't wear a mask while you're in church, you're *actively endangering* everybody else there, including those whose roles preclude them from wearing masks (the priest, the deacon, and the choir).  You're actively showing your reckless disregard for your fellow man, which is the *opposite* of loving them.  By standing in church without a mask, you reveal that you are more concerned with your personal comfort (or perhaps being seen in church) than you are with the health, safety, and well-being of your fellow parishoners.  

I'll admit that it irks me when we commune people who have been actively and recklessly showing wilful disregard for the safety and well being of those around them for the immediate hour and a half previously.  They clearly *do not* love their fellow man.

If you won't wear a mask in church, then why are you even there?  Don't tell me it's because you love God so much, because that's *clearly* not the case, as you clearly *do not* love your fellow man.  You're not doing even the smallest thing possible to protect your priest, your clergy, or the other members of your church from getting sick.  Claims that masks do nothing or that the whole thing is a hoax are explicitly bad faith beliefs based on an epistemology wholly incompatible with Christian belief or with empirical reality.  And I've yet to be informed of a valid medical condition that prevents someone from covering their face at all.  The most I get is that it's inconvenient and uncomfortable.

Yes, you can still get infected and transmit the virus even if you're fully vaccinated--the vaccine is highly effective at preventing illness (though some still get sick), but it cannot be proven to prevent infection and transmission.  Therefore, even the vaccinated should wear a mask in church.",OrthodoxChristianity

&gt;My point is this: heirs, as long as they are minors, are no better than slaves, though they are the owners of all the property; but they remain under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father. So with us; while we were minors, we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the world. But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, ""Abba! Father!"" So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God. Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods. Now, however, that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits? How can you want to be enslaved to them again? You are observing special days, and months, and seasons, and years. I am afraid that my work for you may have been wasted.

Here he equates literal observance of the Torah with slavery to ""the elemental spirits"" and to ""beings which by nature are not gods"". What is he saying here from an Orthodox perspective? At first glance he seems to be essentially saying that slavery to the Law of Moses is not really slavery to God but slavery to intermediate beings and to worldly elements. This sounds very strange to me - he seems to be saying that obedience to the Law and its physical requirements (not just circumcision but also feasts, etc.) is itself idolatry, not being obedience to God but to lesser ""elemental spirits"" and ""beings which are not gods by nature"". What he says in Galatians 3:19-20 appears to confirm this:

&gt;Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made; and it was ordained through angels by a mediator. Now a mediator involves more than one party; but God is one.

Not only is the Law not attributed to God, but it is attributed to ""angels"" and a ""mediator""! The mediator seems to be Moses from the text, but I remember seeing somewhere the idea that this also refers to a heavenly being such as the angel Gabriel. In Galatians, God seems to only be the author of the Law very, very indirectly - He essentially had nothing to do with it but it is the product of the ""guardians and trustees"", who God let create the Law as a pedagogical tool for the Jews to prepare them for God's real and unadulterated revelation of Himself through Jesus. This is what Paul appears to say in Galatians 3:19-26:

&gt;Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made; and it was ordained through angels by a mediator. Now a mediator involves more than one party; but God is one. Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could make alive, then righteousness would indeed come through the law. But the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin, so that what was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian, for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith.

My observation as a layman is that this is a very strange view for a 1st century Jew to hold, even weirder than the idea of Jesus being divine. At least the latter can be attributed to the ""two powers in heaven"" theory. But here, unlike other NT texts which appear to identify unquestionably YHWH with Jesus, and Jesus as the God Who spoke to Moses, the YHWH of Moses and of the Law is at least partially identified with a group of intermediate angelic beings, with the true God basically speaking to Abraham and remaining with His people until they started to transgress (I assume he means the implied transgression in Ezekiel 20:5-11 that the Hebrews adopted Egyptian idolatry... at least that's the only transgression I can think of that happened before the actual Law was given). And while God permitted or commanded these angelic beings to raise His people to adulthood through the Law, they themselves are not God, and are seemingly trying to win the Jews back to the Law even though the true God has shown up again. In fact, Paul's only positive reference to the Law is in Galatians 5:13-16, and is just a passing mention that Christians are not freed from slavery to the Law and its elemental spirits to live in debauchery but to willingly serve one another with love, something the Law also commands.

I don't need to say it - this view seems far more in line with Gnosticism and its archons.

How do the saints understand Paul's words in Galatians? They seem to go against the rest of the New Testament, which is quite concerned with the proper application of the Law in the new covenant context, even with the proper particulars of material worship (texts like Matthew and 1 Corinthians have pretty much the opposite philosophy of Galatians), or is more ambivalent at least (see Romans, where Paul essentially says ""whether you want to observe feasts or not, don't bicker over it""). It definitely seems to go against later patristic material which is very much concerned with the proper application of the Law, with proper feasts and fasts... (see the Apostolic Canons and the Council of Laodicea for instance) And of course, Paul essentially calling the material observance of feasts idolatry in Galatians goes completely against Orthodoxy's concern for the proper calculation of Easter. Also, the Law of Moses is seen as inferior in the NT and the Fathers because the new covenant, with its new context and new objective and new priesthood, also requires a new Law which us superior, the Law of Christ, not written on tablets of stone but on our hearts by the Spirit. But only in Galatians is the distinction between the Law of the old covenant and that of the new covenant based on where these originate from - the Law of Moses originating from angels, but the Law of Christ originating from God.",OrthodoxChristianity

Why some Christians are so strict?,KonstantinosGyros,1620241487," There is a Christian in an other forum, who pobably is not a troll. I checked some of his posts and he seems to be talking really serious about other things too.

I think he even supported that non-Christians should be punished by the goverment by probably being imprisoned.


Probably according to that guy almost everything is a sin? Is enjoying tasty food a sin? I do not think he is a troll because probably there are many Christians who have similar opinions. I even read about a monk who denied having as a gift bed sheets that had flowers on them because  they were too prideful.


So, are we supposed to feel guilt for everything that brings some delight? Even for the flowers of a bed sheet? 


If that was the way someone shoud live, then why Jesus did not state it clearly? Why there are many opinions about how a Christian shoud live? Why even priests disagee?

So, according to them, someone must live in a misery just because Christianity says it? There is much deception in the world (look at politics) and yet we must all live as Christianity says without looking for evidence? I do not see logic in that.

If Christian God is real, would He really blame people for being suspicious of Christianity when some strict Christians are like "" Live like this, have faith even if it cant be proved and do not search""?

Why is God playing games with my life/Why is God even telling me this? (Long read),AlyAnder4,1620236894,"A while ago, it was revealed that my uncle was gay. He was engaged for a long time, this discovery obviously crushing his fiancee. I felt incredibly sorry for her. Due to my OCD, I started obsessing over this and slowly started to develop a fear of becoming engaged to let alone marrying a gay man.

As soon as my fear had really developed, I started coming across recently published articles of celebrities coming out, videos of gay men coming out to their wives, even a TV show I regularly watched published a new episode where the wife came out as lesbian to her husband of 10 years. I thought this was a coincidence at first, that maybe I was just noticing things that were always there because I was fixated on this one particular topic. However these occurrences became much more frequent and specific as time went by.

At the time I was a loose catholic, I had new age beliefs and I often asked the universe for signs. A lot of the time I would feel the urge to ask for a sign out of the blue, due to my OCD and intrusive thoughts. I would say stuff like ""Show me this number 3 times in a row if my husband will be gay."" Boom. Done. ""Show me this rare bird if my husband will be gay."" Boom. A bird that I have never seen suddenly appears outside my window. ""Show me x,y,x,x,y,x in that exact order if my husband will be gay."" And so it was.

Even after being born again, these occurrences seem to be following me. I volunteer at a charity shop, and yesterday 3 customers came in after each other wearing all white. I jokingly thought to myself ""Please give us a customer who is not wearing white if my husband will not be gay."" A man NOT wearing white walks into the shop. Turns out, my manager knew him. ""Oh, hello Mr WHITE.""

All of these ""signs from God"" have been extremely fuzzy. I have never received anything clear, it's always something silly like the example I gave above. Not once have I received a dream from God, a sign from a saint, or come across a Bible verse specific to my situation, even after praying for confirmation from God with tears in my eyes.

I just don't understand why God is doing this to me. It has only caused me anxiety and dread. I've also contemplated suicide a few times because the thought of this really coming true is so humiliating and horrible. I have even gotten involved with new age practices, e.g tarot readings in order to receive some clarity/try to change my fate. In other words, it has only caused me pain and worsened my relationship with God.

People tell me to comapre the signs to the word of God but there's nothing in the Bible about gay husbands lmao.

I also think it's so unfair. In the Bible, whenever God says that something bad will happen, he tells the prophets to warn the people and tells them how to change their ways in order to prevent said tragic event from happening. Meanwhile here God is just telling me that my marriage will be a lie.

This has been going on for years and tbh it's getting old. Why is God doing this to me? It feels as if he is playing games with my life and is laughing at me.

I've pretty much lost all hope, whenever I bring this up all people can say is ""it's just a coincidence"".",OrthodoxChristianity
"I think I might want to become orthodox, but I feel so lost",Ok-Match-8738,1620234025,"Hello, r/OrthodoxChristianity !  


I am using a throwaway account because my friends at church know of my main reddit account, and I am not ready to tell them that I am having these doubts just yet.  


For about five-ish years I've been considering my faith, and this summer after reading a lot about church history I finally decided to leave my secular past and was confirmed into the catholic church. (Roman Catholic). It was great and I really felt at home. I continued praying, making catholic friends, learning about its theology, history, etc. For the longest time I was convinced, and still am to some extent, about the theology regarding St Peter as the first pope. But as I began reading more and more of the early church fathers, and what they believed, I just wasn't so sure anymore.  


For some time now, I have felt really disconnected from the church and latin rite, so I began attending an eastern catholic parish. For some time that felt good, but on some level I am still having these doubts about what the early church fathers had written. More specifically:  


1. If Peter was God's vicar on earth, why was it not him alone that silenced the council at Jerusalem, but also Barnabas?  

2. If it was Peter that was the first pope, why is one of the earliest accounts of this (namely St Irenaeus) stating that it was Peter and Paul?  

3. Immaculate Conception. This one is just impossible to understand, so I could no doubt just be wrong on this one.   

4. Filioque. As it seems the holy spirit acts outside of Jesus for some time in the old testament and how it is described by early church fathers. But it is also something that I'm lenient towards the catholic teaching, that it proceeds from the son.  


So now I am erring if I should contact my local Orthodox priest to talk about some of these doubts and learn more about orthodox theology, but at the same time it feels like I will be looking like a fool. I just converted to catholicism and told all my friends and family about that, how would it look if I ALREADY am doubting this decision? I'm not sure if the grass just seems greener on the other side or if there is actually something to this. Perhaps God wants me to become Orthodox, but wanted to prepare me through the western church? I'm not entirely leaning in any direction between remaining Catholic or contacting an Orthodox priest, but I have decided to stay catholic for the time being and pray as much as I can. Please pray for me.

Some don't realize the Anti-Christ has a religion with a false god that he honors and he wants all to submit to this god.

Dan 11:38 - Instead, he will honor a god of fortresses  
Dan 11:39 With the help of this foreign god, he will capture the strongest fortresses. Everyone who worships this god will be put in a position of power and rewarded with wealth and land.

This false god is the same as the DRAGON in the book of Revelation. These people in this kingdom do no realize their false god is SATAN/DRAGON, so they worship him for giving his power and authority to the ANTICHRIST.

Revelation 13:4  
and they worshipped the dragon (a false god), because he gave his authority unto the beast

We see this idea portrayed in Islam:  
‚ÄúFor, the authority of a caliph is connected to the authority of Allah‚Äù  
‚Äúthat caliphate is a divine position and Allah‚Äôs representation‚Äù  
‚ÄúAllah‚Äôs caliph in the earth necessitates that he should be appointed by Allah only‚Äù

This is what the Bible describes when it says the Dragon (Allah) gave his authority to the beast (Caliph)  
""And they worshiped the Dragon (Allah) because he gave his authority unto the beast (Caliph)"" -Revelation 13:4

There are 2 entities being worshiped not just 1, THE DRAGON (a false god) which this whole empire of people follows, AND THE BEAST, THE KING OF THAT EMPIRE.

 I worry because in the past I smoked again a few normal cigarettes. Since my ocd is about a specific punishment from Christian God, what if other Gods who maybe accepted the promise, considered that what my ocd fears is a good way to be punished?

 If that fear of punishment had appeared BEFORE the promises, I probably would not have made them. i worry because I have said to Christian God and maybe other Gods heard me if Christian God is not real, to free me from ocd promises.

"Neither convert nor cradle, quite",MachiavellianSwiz,1620078490,"My background:

I was Christened in the Orthodox Church, as was my father and my paternal grandparents; my grandmother's father was actually an Orthodox priest. My mother converted (her family were non-religious) and my parents were married in the Church. However, my parents divorced when I was very young, and I never attended services although I did grow up with the iconography and imagery being ever-present. My father drifted into the Pentacostal sects (which really repulsed me) and my mother married an Anglican.

I gradually became non-religious due to the incompatibility of Western Christianity's rationalism and literalism with my own understanding of the world. I moved towards a kind of naturalistic pantheism eventually because wanted to marry my own literal beliefs with a reverence and mythic resonance.

In the last ten years I've attended a handful of services initially because the single direct exposure I had to the Church was my grandmother's funeral decades earlier, and that left an indelible mark on me. And when I do attend, I feel really loved and welcomed, like a homecoming. But I also feel like a bit of an imposter--it gives me comfort to reconnect with my heritage, which I really haven't had contact with since my grandmother died, but I don't know if I can fully embrace it as a lifestyle and set of firmly held beliefs.

I guess this is almost a crisis of identity, and the fact that I'm halfway between someone born into the Church and an outsider means that I feel a heavier burden to be 100% on board in order to reclaim my status as a member of the Church in a way I might not had I casually continued throughout my life.

My initial questions are, how literally would a member of the Church be expected to take the NT? What is the line between symbolism and historicity? Or perhaps, while there is dogma on paper, what is the practical reality of literal belief for most members?",OrthodoxChristianity

I am so confused,Hypcon93,1620060606,"Christ is risen!

So hi everybody. And sorry about my crappy english. tl;dr: I am not actually orthodox yet. I am lutheran protestant, praying to find the true church.

Story time: I am 27 years old Finnish guy. I was baptized as lutheran as infant, but my parents were not practicing christians: we never attended lutheran church services etc. 

As teenager I became so called ""new atheist"". I was quite interested about religions, but as I had not any christian upbringing, I thought that christianity is completely irrational and harmful superstition. I read a lot Richard Dawkins' books. I thought that they were very good and clever. When I was 18 years, I finally resigned from the church.

However, as years passed by and i grew up I started to think differently. It was mostly because of my philosophy major in university: I started to understand, how limited our rational capacities are - if greatest minds of mankind can not agree on one thing after more than 2000 years of philosophizing, how this generation of ours could find anything really important about the world. I was confused and started to study teachings of different religions. I tought that eastern Asian religions like buddhism or taoism could be more ""philosophical"" and not so ""superstitious"" as christianity. However, I felt that their culture is too distant and I could not have true connection with them. So I abandonded them. And then I started reading the Holy Bible.

After reading the gospels I felt something special. Christianity seemed no longer to be irrational. It was beyond rational. I don't completely understand nor can I explain this change in my thinking, but after that I became much more interested about christianity. And I became much more interested about other people and their worries - and less concerned about my own personal truth seeking. Soon I rejoined lutheran church.

However, I no longer feel connected with protestant christianity. Lutheran church is very ""liberal"", and changes its opinions quite frequently. It has very weak historical tradition, and I am quite sure, that true form of christianity can not be constantly changing shape. So I recently visited orthodox monastery of Valamo. There I felt amazing inner peace. I decided that I must become orthodox, and started reading all kind of orthodox literature. As pandemic continues, I can not attend any services yet.

However, I am worried about some cultural differences. As I have been atheist or protestant nearly my whole life, I have no any deep connections with eastern orthodox culture or faith. In Finland most of orthodoxes also have Karelian (one of Finnish ethnic groups) or Russian heritage - unlike me - so I am worried how I could ""fit in"", altough I highly appreciate their cultural traditions. My wife also has quite religious family, and her family is lutherans, so I am worried how my parents-in-laws would react if I join orthodox church.

So I am asking prayers or any supporting feedback, as I have not courage to change my church yet, altough I know it is the only path I should choose.

The prayer came to me one day roughly a decade ago when I first wrote it down, and since then I haven't shared it publicly for fear that I may receive credit for writing it and be given over to pride.  


Have mercy on me, O God  
For You are infinitely merciful  
And You give your Love to the deserving and undeserving alike.  
The sinner you mercifully chastise, because of Your Love for him,  
And the righteous you firmly establish in wisdom through your encouragement and teaching.  
Therefore, let the righteous continue praising You,  
For You keep them, since they have kept Your ways and made them their ways.  
Thus, through Your Spirit, the righteous shall rejoice, singing in Your Glory, forever.  
But as for me, I have sinned against You, my Lord and God.  
In my heart I have blasphemed Your Son, Jesus, my salvation, and Your Spirit, who is my strength and my protection.  
So knowing this, I beg You, my God, do not take Your life from me.  
Do not give me up as You did with Pharaoh,  
Nor allow my hope to fail as with Judas.  
For Your Love is more desirable than any of man's pursuits,  
And Your Light is more brilliant than the Sun's.  
For in Your Love I am united with all of Your creation,  
And in Your Light is revealed the true face of every man,  
And the true beauty in all of Your creation.  
My Christ, though my spirit is downcast within me,  
And my mind approaches despair,  
I come to you with abundant hope.  
For You deigned, through the obedience of the Virgin Mother of God, Mary the Theotokos, to become man,  
To take on and assume our full human nature and fallen condition,  
And to die by crucifixion unto resurrection for our sakes.  
For it is by participating in Your Sacraments,  
Through Baptism and partaking of Your most precious and life-giving Body and Blood,  
That we are restored to true life and reunited the blessed Trinity eternally.  
By virtue of these things, I see that You did not abandon the sinners before me who trusted in You,

What if I do not want to believe?,CityHunterAgain,1620051742," I lost most of my faith because Christianity is not making sense to me any more. 

 I cant understand faith. I cant understand why we get saved through faith..We are born with selfish desires in a fallen world and yet the rules to get in heaven are impossible, thats why we need faith  to  get to heaven. But having faith means there is not enough evidence to support the belief. So, the only way to get to heaven is to have faith without enough evidence? 

That seems suspicious to me. Probably many people with other religions strongly believe that their religion is the right one in a same way a Christian does for Christianity.


We are being born in a world with selfish desires, where there is much deception (by people, maybe by other religions) and we have to choose the right religion even though there is not enough evidence?

 I think I want Jesus to be real but since Christianity does not make sense to me, at least not in this period, then, what should I do? I cant pretend to believe when Christianity is not making sense to me.",OrthodoxChristianity

I'm hoping I'm not the only one who's been struggling and has been struggling with no fellowship or support from other Orthodox. This past weekend was a crushing reminder of how alone I am. I'm sure I'm being prayed for by others but there is no substitute for human contact - a phone call, email, text, something. I'm disabled but, it seems, not ill enough for the people I once surrounded myself with, including my Spiritual Father. It feels like, once I wasn't able to help myself, spiritually, emotionally or otherwise, everyone disappeared. 

I'm fighting to not feel sorry for myself, wondering why I've been forgotten. i try not to think I'm among the ones Jesus was saying to visit or help. 

The joy of Pascha just makes everything so much more raw.

Forgive me for wasting this space with self-pity. I wish I could be joyous. I am taking baby steps to try to help myself and find health and strength. I have all the medical help one could ask for. Without emotional or spiritual support, it's just a much longer and harder journey.

Advice Orthodox christian in a catholic country,LordIsmyShepherd7,1619991625,"First thing I must say CHRIST IS RISEN!
Ok now to the question:
I'm from a country which is majority christian and after searching for truth since beginning of puberty I have found peace in Orthodoxy. I was baptised in a catholic church and my father is catholic while the rest of the family are atheists, we never go to church on sundays only on major holidays(easter, saints day, christmas) or mass for my grandfather. 

As an orthodox christian I must be baptised in an orthodox church but the problem is the only orthodox chruches in my country are churches of another country, and the language they speak is foreign, also my country-catholic and the other country of which language is spoken in the orthodox church were at war 30 years ago and both churches asociate nationality with being orthodox/catholic (heresy). My family doesn't mind about my religiosity and also one of my grandparents who died 3 years after i was born was from the orthodox country but was atheist, so my surnames are like this:one from catholic and the other from orthodox country, anyways war in this area stopped only two decades ago when i was born(it stopped 30 years ago in my country). So do you guys think if it is okay if I go to catholic church since people from orthodox church(and country) will probably look at me like im an outsider, and i also dont know the language(another lagnuage of same language family but different enough so i cant inderstand it when spoken normaly). Is it okay of if I just go to catholic church. Im already frowned upon by schoolmates for being orthodox and they are catholic and because one of my grandparents was from the orthodox country (with which my/catholic country was at war with)even tho he was atheist.

So is it okay if I start normaly attending catholic church with my grandma since i dont(barely) understand the language of the orthodox church and because of the recent wars 20-30 years ago?",OrthodoxChristianity

My last Pascha as a Catholic,Seeking_Not_Finding,1619982604,"Christ is Risen!

Some of you might recognize me. I frequent this subreddit quite a bit. A little over three years ago, I made this Reddit account to investigate something that had been pressing on my mind. I had begun to research the ancient traditions of the Christian faith and had encountered Apostolic Christianity for the first time: namely, Catholicism. I discovered that the early church was liturgical, sacramental, and reasonable. I read about the ancient heresies, the Ecumenical Councils, and the great Fathers of the Church. I realized that the view of the Bible I had been taught growing up in an evangelical household was not quite all there was to the story. I realized that Christ had founded a Church, and that Church had authority to bind and loose.

And so then becoming Catholic was inevitable in my mind. After all, the reformers were clearly wrong about so many things relating to the Church Fathers and Biblical interpretation, and so why would they be correct about their rejection of Catholic teachings? It was clear to me that the Catholic Church had these apostolic views: they had a sacramental priesthood, they had Ecumenical Councils, they had liturgy (and some Latin Masses on occasion), heck, they even had Divine Liturgy! After 2 or 3 years of studying, I was received into the Catholic Church. That was a little under a year ago now.

So there I was, a Catholic amongst Protestants at my college. There was one Orthodox person at my College I was friends with. And I mean she was literally the only Orthodox person at my college. Ever since she found out I was planning on becoming Catholic 2 years ago, she'd been trying to get me to visit her Church. But then I would have work, or she would be sick, or Coronavirus would happen, and for whatever reason, it always fell through. But after 2 years of attempts, I finally was able to visit just last month.

I had zero intentions of ever leaving Catholicism. I had already gone through the process of conversion, of telling my Protestant family I was making such a life change. But for some reason I couldn't draw myself away from Divine Liturgy. I began going weekly. Maybe I could just go to Mass on Saturday evening and Divine Liturgy on Sundays, that could work. Last week I felt like I needed to have my prayer rope blessed by the priest of this Church. Having it blessed by a Catholic priest just didn't seem right to me. And so I brought it to Father after the service. He remarked, ""Great! I'll give it back to you once you're Orthodox.""

I froze up. I can't remember if he said it half-jokingly or completely serious, but it didn't matter. The words hit me like a brick wall. Part of me wanted to correct him, tell him that I was Catholic and just enjoyed worshipping in the Divine Liturgy. That I had found my spiritual home already. Yet the rest of me was saying the exact opposite.

There was always parts of Catholicism that didn't sit right with me. An indulgence here, an apparition there; and in that moment, every single one of them flew past my mind all at once. The immaculate conception, Papal supremacy, ""immediate and ordinary jurisdiction,"" the appointing of all bishops by the Pope, the immaculate heart of Mary, the sacred heart of Jesus, indulgences, our Lady of Fatima, of La Salette, of Guadalupe, the Brown Scapular, the Sabbatine Privilege‚Äîeven the Rosary. But I had managed to ignore them. 

""Private revelations aren't binding on the Church."" 

""I don't need to pray the Rosary or wear the Scapular to be a good Catholic."" 

""Indulgences make sense because the Pope has the authority to define those doctrines."" 

""The Pope certainly had authority in the first millennium, so ."" 

I needed to be Catholic despite, well, Catholicism. After all, the Catholic Church teaches so many true things. It's apostolic, sacramental, creedal. What choice did I have? Protestants were clearly wrong about all of those issues, so I was left at square one.

Except I wasn't. There I was, in the Parish Hall of an Orthodox Church. But I could never be one of those people who converts to Catholicism only to become Orthodox later. I knew the truth of the Catholic Church. They just wanted the easy way out on divorce and contraception. I would never give in like that.

The Priest asks if I would like to meet up and discuss possibly becoming Orthodox.

And I realized I didn't want anything more. After years of searching, of doubt, of confusion, of hope, of, well, ""seeking\_not\_finding,"" I finally found home.

Christ is risen from the dead, trampling over death by death. And he grabbed me out of my spiritual tomb into life.

I need help understanding an interaction I just had with an orthodox family/gentleman.,Watermelon407,1619915812,"Hello All!

Problem:
My wife and I are having an internal dilemma on the receiving of a dessert gift from an orthodox couple that is clearly meant for their Easter celebration tomorrow in response to us gifting them homemade bread. We are very appreciative of the gift, but we're conflicted on causing them to feel obligated to return the gift, especially with something of clear significance. We're seeking some insight into this as well as potential ways to engage them in that conversation if there may be a different custom tht we should be aware of.

Background:
My wife and I live in the southern midwest of the US. Our neighbors are a forgien middle aged couple (I can't quite place the language they speak to eachother in or their nationality, but I have a hunch they're Turkish). In our limited interactions with them, they are friendly but reserved (we say hi in passing kind of thing), limited english ability.

Anyway, I'm a trained baker (though my day job I work with spreadsheets haha). Originally when we moved into our apartment we made just basic white bread for our neighbors with a little card that had our contact information to say hi. It also had a short message about not being able to break bread together like we normally would like too given COVID. This couple was very appreciative and called me to thank me what seemed like profusely. Anyway, nothing else happened. Until today.

Today, I was baking again and ended up with 2 Amish Friendship Bread loaves more than I planned for (my starter was very active this week). So we put one in a tupperware box with a little note card to tell them what it was and my wife left it on their step.

Not an hour later we get a knock with the gentleman presenting us a massive flaky baked good that I can't identity (hopefully someone on here can) that's topped with raisins and a layer of powdered sugar. He says hi and thanks us again. I asked him what it was an he responded that he's orthodox and it's a traditional dessert for Easter tomorrow, but that's all we could manage before he went on his way.

We obviously graciously accept this, but feel a bit conflicted that this is clearly for a special religious event and my bread is just extra bread haha.

Paschal Sermon of St. John Chrystosom,IrinaSophia,1619893482,"The Sermon of St. John Chrystosom is one of my favorite parts of thecl Paschal Service. Especially toward the end!

If anyone is devout and a lover of God, let him enjoy this beautiful and radiant festival.
If anyone is a wise servant, let him, rejoicing, enter into the joy of his Lord.
If anyone has wearied himself in fasting, let him now receive his recompense.
If anyone has labored from the first hour, let him today receive his just reward. 
If anyone has come at the third hour, with thanksgiving let him keep the feast. 
If anyone has arrived at the sixth hour, let him have no misgivings; for he shall suffer no loss. 
If anyone has delayed until the ninth hour, let him draw near without hesitation. 
If anyone has arrived even at the eleventh hour, let him not fear on account of his delay. 
For the Master is gracious and receives the last, even as the first; he gives rest to him that comes at the eleventh hour, just as to him who has labored from the first. 
He has mercy upon the last and cares for the first; to the one he gives, and to the other he is gracious. He both honors the work and praises the intention.
Enter all of you, therefore, into the joy of our Lord, and, whether first or last, receive your reward. 
O rich and poor, one with another, dance for joy! 
O you ascetics and you negligent, celebrate the day! You that have fasted and you that have disregarded the fast, rejoice today! 
The table is rich-laden; feast royally, all of you! 
The calf is fatted; let no one go forth hungry!
Let all partake of the feast of faith. 
Let all receive the riches of goodness.
Let no one lament his poverty, for the universal kingdom has been revealed.
Let no one mourn his transgressions, for pardon has dawned from the grave.
Let no one fear death, for the Saviour's death has set us free.
He that was taken by death has annihilated it! 
He descended into hades and took hades captive! He embittered it when it tasted his flesh! 
*And anticipating this Isaiah exclaimed, ""Hades was embittered when it encountered thee in the lower regions."" It was embittered, for it was abolished! 
It was embittered, for it was mocked! 
It was embittered, for it was purged! 
It was embittered, for it was despoiled! 
It was embittered, for it was bound in chains!
It took a body and, face to face, met God! 
It took earth and encountered heaven! 
It took what it saw but crumbled before what it had not seen!""O death, where is thy sting? O hades, where is thy victory?""
Christ is risen, and you are overthrown!
Christ is risen, and the demons are fallen!
Christ is risen, and the angels rejoice!
Christ is risen, and life reigns!
Christ is risen, and not one dead remains in a tomb!For Christ, being raised from the dead, has become the First-fruits of them that slept.
To him be glory and might unto ages of ages. Amen.*",OrthodoxChristianity

About original/ancestral sin,HipnotistaDeEsquina,1619890321,"I've always had this weird feeling towards what I've always been taught about Christ's sacrifice and original sin. It just didn't make sense in my head that Jesus died as expiation for our sinful nature. It always seemed to me that this teaching is very similar to ancient religion's sacrificial rituals where people sought to bargain with dieties in order to gain their favor. A primitive way of thinking. 

Also very similar to some rudimentary notions of justice in which a person who had absolutely nothing to do with someone else's transgression was fit to be punished for those same transgressions, which I've always found absurd. It's also absurd in my head the idea that someone who hasn't had the opportunity to receive the benefits of His sacrifice would be eternally damned for a sinful nature that they had absolutely no fault for being born with. 

This never seemed to be like the work of a just God. But even with all this doubt, I grew to accept these teachings over time, even though I was always more inclined to believe in a different, more profound explanation of Jesus's death and resurrection (which I wasn't sure what it was) than in this legalistic one that I told myself we only used for didactic purposes.

So today I had a discussion on Facebook with this Lutheran guy who said that the Eastern Orthodox had strayed from the truth starting with their denial of original sin. So I looked it up and read a bit about the Orthodox view of original (or ancestral) sin and how it focuses on the death of the physical body rather than on the transmission of sin. When I posted a few screenshots of the explanation I had read, he said this:

*"" you can see how synergistic they very blatantly are.*

*They're also very neo-Platonic with their doctrine of Theosis, which also deviates from the Scriptures""*

To which I responded:

*""Were those the original teachings, though? The pro-Orthodox argument is that they preserve the early Church's doctrine and traditions.""*

And then he said:

*""The Arians, Nestorians, and modern Charismatics also make the same claim. If it cannot be backed up from Scripture, it's a worthless claim.*

*In my study of the East in grad school, when researching the Nestorian controversy, I saw just how deviant the East had already become.*

*Lutherans have this bad habit of romanticising the East, when in fact they went rogue before Rome or Alexandria did.""*

So, I have a few questions for you:

\- Is the Orthodox teaching of 'ancestral sin' the same as the early Church's teachings? How can I verify that? 

\- How does that not contradict the Scriptures?

\- When did this legalistic view of original sin and Christ's death on the cross came to be? Was it St. Augustine who came up with it? Was he wrong? Does it have anything to do with the context in which he conceived this idea?",OrthodoxChristianity

The Gospel of Nicodemus &amp; The Harrowing of Hell,feeble_stirrings,1619807418,"[1](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospelnicodemus.html) And while all the saints were rejoicing, behold Satan the prince and chief of death said unto Hell: Make thyself ready to receive Jesus who boasteth himself that he is the Son of God, whereas he is a man that feareth death, and sayeth: My soul is sorrowful even unto death. And he hath been much mine enemy, doing me great hurt, and many that I had made blind, lame, dumb, leprous, and possessed he hath healed with a word: and some whom I have brought unto thee dead, them hath he taken away from thee.
2 Hell answered and said unto Satan the prince: Who is he that is so mighty, if he be a man that feareth death? for all the mighty ones of the earth are held in subjection by my power, even they whom thou hast brought me subdued by thy power. If, then, thou art mighty, what manner of man is this Jesus who, though he fear death, resisteth thy power? If he be so mighty in his manhood, verily I say unto thee he is almighty in his god-head, and no man can withstand his power. And when he saith that he feareth death, he would ensnare thee, and woe shall be unto thee for everlasting ages. But Satan the prince of Tartarus said: Why doubtest thou and fearest to receive this Jesus which is thine adversary and mine? For I tempted him, and have stirred up mine ancient people of the Jews with envy and wrath against him. I have sharpened a spear to thrust him through, gall and vinegar have I mingled to give him to drink, and I have prepared a cross to crucify him and nails to pierce him: and his death is nigh at hand, that I may bring him unto thee to be subject unto thee and me.
3 Hell answered and said: Thou hast told me that it is he that hath taken away dead men from me. For there be many which while they lived on the earth have taken dead men from me, yet not by their own power but by prayer to God, and their almighty God hath taken them from me. Who is this Jesus which by his own word without prayer hath drawn dead men from me? Perchance it is he which by the word of his command did restore to life Lazarus which was four days dead and stank and was corrupt, whom I held here dead. Satan the prince of death answered and said: It is that same Jesus. When Hell heard that he said unto him: I adjure thee by thy strength and mine own that thou bring him not unto me. For at that time I, when I heard the command of his word, did quake and was overwhelmed with fear, and all my ministries with me were troubled. Neither could we keep Lazarus, but he like an eagle shaking himself leaped forth with all agility and swiftness, and departed from us, and the earth also which held the dead body of Lazarus straightway gave him up alive. Wherefore now I know that that man which was able to do these things is a God strong in command and mighty in manhood, and that he is the saviour of mankind. And if thou bring him unto me he will set free all that are here shut up in the hard prison and bound in the chains of their sins that cannot be broken, and will bring them unto the life of his god head for ever.
V (XXI)
1 And as Satan the prince, and Hell, spoke this together, suddenly there came a voice as of thunder and a spiritual cry: Remove, O princes, your gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. When Hell heard that he said unto Satan the prince: Depart from me and go out of mine abode: if thou be a mighty man of war, fight thou against the King of glory. But what hast thou to do with him? And Hell cast Satan forth out of his dwelling. Then said Hell unto his wicked ministers: Shut ye the hard gates of brass and put on them the bars of iron and withstand stoutly, lest we that hold captivity be taken captive.
2 But when all the multitude of the saints heard it, they spake with a voice of rebuking unto Hell: Open thy gates, that the King of glory may come in. And David cried out, saying: Did I not when I was alive upon earth, foretell unto you: Let them give thanks unto the Lord, even his mercies and his wonders unto the children of men; who hath broken the gates of brass and smitten the bars of iron in sunder? he hath taken them out of the way of their iniquity. And thereafter in like manner Esaias said: Did not I when I was alive upon earth foretell unto you: The dead shall arise, and they that are in the tombs shall rise again, and they that are in the earth shall rejoice, for the dew which cometh of the Lord is their healing? And again I said: O death, where is thy sting? O Hell, where is thy victory?
3 When they heard that of Esaias, all the saints said unto Hell: Open thy gates: now shalt thou be overcome and weak and without strength. And there came a great voice as of thunder, saying: Remove, O princes, your gates, and be ye lift up ye doors of hell, and the King of glory shall come in. And when Hell saw that they so cried out twice, he said, as if he knew it not: Who is the King of glory? And David answered Hell and said: The words of this cry do I know, for by his spirit I prophesied the same; and now I say unto thee that which I said before: The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle, he is the King of glory. And: The Lord looked down from heaven that he might hear the groanings of them that are in fetters and deliver the children of them that have been slain. And now, O thou most foul and stinking Hell, open thy gates, that the King of glory may come in. And as David spake thus unto Hell, the Lord of majesty appeared in the form of a man and lightened the eternal darkness and brake the bonds that could not be loosed: and the succour of his everlasting might visited us that sat in the deep darkness of our transgressions and in the shadow of death of our sins.
VI (XXII)
1 When Hell and death and their wicked ministers saw that, they were stricken with fear, they and their cruel officers, at the sight of the brightness of so great light in their own realm, seeing Christ of a sudden in their abode, and they cried out, saying: We are overcome by thee. Who art thou that art sent by the Lord for our confusion? Who art thou that without all damage of corruption, and with the signs (?) of thy majesty unblemished, dost in wrath condemn our power? Who art thou that art so great and so small, both humble and exalted, both soldier and commander, a marvelous warrior in the shape of a bondsman, and a King of glory dead and living, whom the cross bare slain upon it? Thou that didst lie dead in the sepulchre hast come down unto us living and at thy death all creation quaked and all the stars were shaken and thou hast become free among the dead and dost rout our legions. Who art thou that settest free the prisoners that are held bound by original sin and restorest them into their former liberty? Who art thou that sheddest thy divine and bright light upon them that were blinded with the darkness of their sins? After the same manner all the legions of devils were stricken with like fear and cried out all together in the terror of their confusion, saying: Whence art thou, Jesus, a man so mighty and bright in majesty, so excellent without spot and clean from sin? For that world of earth which hath been always subject unto us until now, and did pay tribute to our profit, hath never sent unto us a dead man like thee, nor ever dispatched such a gift unto Hell. Who then art thou that so fearlessly enterest our borders, and not only fearest not our torments, but besides essayest to bear away all men out of our bonds? Peradventure thou art that Jesus, of whom Satan our prince said that by thy death of the cross thou shouldest receive the dominion of the whole world.
2 Then did the King of glory in his majesty trample upon death, and laid hold on Satan the prince and delivered him unto the power of Hell, and drew Adam to him unto his own brightness.

VII (XXIII)
Then Hell, receiving Satan the prince, with sore reproach said unto him: O prince of perdition and chief of destruction, Beelzebub, the scorn of the angels and spitting of the righteous why wouldest thou do this? Thou wouldest crucify the King of glory and at his decease didst promise us great spoils of his death: like a fool thou knewest not what thou didst. For behold now, this Jesus putteth to flight by the brightness of his majesty all the darkness of death, and hath broken the strong depths of the prisons, and let out the prisoners and loosed them that were bound. And all that were sighing in our torments do rejoice against us, and at their prayers our dominions are vanquished and our realms conquered, and now no nation of men feareth us any more. And beside this, the dead which were never wont to be proud triumph over us, and the captives which never could be joyful do threaten us. O prince Satan, father of all the wicked and ungodly and renegades wherefore wouldest thou do this? They that from the beginning until now have despaired of life and salvation-now is none of their wonted roarings heard, neither doth any groan from them sound in our ears, nor is there any sign of tears upon the face of any of them. O prince Satan, holder of the keys of hell, those thy riches which thou hadst gained by the tree of transgression and the losing of paradise, thou hast lost by the tree of the cross, and all thy gladness hath perished. When thou didst hang up Christ Jesus the King of glory thou wroughtest against thyself and against me. Henceforth thou shalt know what eternal torments and infinite pains thou art to suffer in my keeping for ever. O prince Satan, author of death and head of all pride, thou oughtest first to have sought out matter of evil in this Jesus: Wherefore didst thou adventure without cause to crucify him unjustly against whom thou foundest no blame, and to bring into our realm the innocent and righteous one, and to lose the guilty and the ungodly and unrighteous of the whole world? And when Hell had spoken thus unto Satan the prince, then said the King of glory unto Hell: Satan the prince shall be in thy power unto all ages in the stead of Adam and his children, even those that are my righteous ones.
VIII (XXIV)
1 And the Lord stretching forth his hand, said: Come unto me, all ye my saints which bear mine image and my likeness. Ye that by the tree and the devil and death were condemned, behold now the devil and death condemned by the tree. And forthwith all the saints were gathered in one under the hand of the Lord. And the Lord holding the right hand of Adam, said unto him: Peace be unto thee with all thy children that are my righteous ones. But Adam, casting himself at the knees of the Lord entreated him with tears and beseechings, and said with a loud voice: I will magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up and not made my foes to triumph over me: O Lord my God I cried unto thee and thou hast healed me; Lord, thou hast brought my soul out of hell, thou hast delivered me from them that go down to the pit. Sing praises unto the Lord all ye saints of his, and give thanks unto him for the remembrance of his holiness. For there is wrath in his indignation and life is in his good pleasure. In like manner all the saints of God kneeled and cast themselves at the feet of the Lord, saying with one accord: Thou art come, O redeemer of the world: that which thou didst foretell by the law and by thy prophets, that hast thou accomplished in deed. Thou hast redeemed the living by thy cross, and by the death of the cross thou hast come down unto us, that thou mightest save us out of hell and death through thy majesty. O Lord, like as thou hast set the name of thy glory in the heavens and set up thy cross for a token of redemption upon the earth, so, Lord, set thou up the sign of the victory of thy cross in hell, that death may have no more dominion.
2 And the Lord stretched forth his hand and made the sign of the cross over Adam and over all his saints, and he took the right hand of Adam and went up out of hell, and all the saints followed him. Then did holy David cry aloud and say: Sing unto the Lord a new song, for he hath done marvelous things. His right hand hath wrought salvation for him and his holy arm. The Lord hath made known his saving health, before the face of all nations hath he revealed his righteousness. And the whole multitude of the saints answered, saying: Such honour have all his saints. Amen, Alleluia.

3 And thereafter Habacuc the prophet cried out and said: Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people to set free thy chosen. And all the saints answered, saying: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. God is the Lord and hath showed us light. Amen, Alleluia. Likewise after that the prophet Micheas also cried, saying: What God is like thee, O Lord, taking away iniquity and removing sins? and now thou withholdest thy wrath for a testimony that thou art merciful of free will, and thou dost turn away and have mercy on us, thou forgivest all our iniquities and hast sunk all our sins in the depths of the sea, as thou swarest unto our fathers in the days of old. And all the saints answered, saying: This is our God for ever and ever, he shall be our guide, world without end. Amen, Alleluia. And so spake all the prophets, making mention of holy words out of their praises, and all the saints followed the Lord, crying Amen, Alleluia.",OrthodoxChristianity

""The health, wealth, and happiness taught by the prosperity and word of faith movement generally promote that more Christian living, greater funding to the church, or other spiritual actions will lead to a life of less suffering and greater blessing. This is widely pursued and accepted by unbelievers, because it offers what their flesh already wants - health, wealth, and happiness.The suffering that glorifies Christ is suffering in the midst of pursuing and performing the works of Christ. He lived a perfect life and suffered on the earth as fully God yet fully man. In the midst of His sufferings, he never renounced the Father or fell short of what the Law commanded.Since Jesus first was persecuted and suffered while doing the work of the Father, we also should expect to suffer while doing the same works.A faith based on never dealing with suffering would be shallow at best compared to a faith that has been tested and held true through suffering, persecution, and other trials.""

Why is there still a schism,JamoonX,1619430083,"Crossposted on r/Christianity and r/Catholicism, just to get more perspectives on that.

Hello, I am 20, Serbian-Orthodox and quite inexperienced with the deeper doctrines of Christianity, especially when it comes to differences between denominations.

My question, and forgive my lack of knowledge and maybe consideration as well, is why is there still a schism between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Church today?

As far as my superficial research goes, apparently the most dividing factors are the filioque and the primacy of Rome. I somewhat understand the different perspective the churches take on the topics, but they seem so little and (excuse me again) unimportant to me when it comes to belief. I wonder why we have such a big division over something apparently so little, even though I, maybe in my naive lack of understanding, think we have far more in common and should rather work together to give people a sense of responsibility and purpose in life.

It is especially tiring for me since in former Yugoslavia, faith is mostly connected to the country. In the past, people were forcefully assimilated by being converted to other religions in order to escape repercussions and people just don't want to let go of that despise for each other, so it always stays that Roman Catholic = Croatian, Muslim = Bosnian and Orthodox = Serbian. Every discussion about what perspective of the RCC is better than the one of the OC and vice versa mostly develops into a geo-political and historical discussion, while the faith itself is always forgotten.

So, to sum it up, why are the churches still so divided over something that seems unimportant in the great scheme of things?",OrthodoxChristianity

 I was scared. I wanted to ask for another chance, even though probably there was no need to. I was just worried. So, in order to prove to Him that I want another chance. I made a promise about not smoking again. I also asked for a non-specific punishment in case breaking the promise in order to use the fear of punishment whenever I am thinking about smoking.


 I gave up smoking but there were times that I smoked a few normal cigarettes. 

I have almost lost my faith to Christian God and I worry what if other Gods accepted the promise? Was the promise valid on the first place? Can I blame it on my ocd? I have ocd and I made the promise from fear.

encouragement to continue,Nationalist_Republic,1619356786,"(Tldr at the bottom)

This is not a humble brag, this is advice I'm giving due to the fact I've seen others, and myself question why when we grow closer to God the devil attacks us. 

Recently I've been able to listen to prayers and chants for 8+ hours a day while working. Ever since then I've received sexual dreams and have seen evil spirits in them every night. Temptations become stronger and my thoughts become disturbing sometimes. Why does this happen? The answer is simple. The devil attacks those who are striving for Theosis. He doesn't attack satanists or other people who belong to him because they are his, he doesn't need to because if he does they may seek help from Christians and then he loses them to God.

Remember we all have the sinful side of us and we fight against it daily, if not done properly this can lead to despair and the falling away from the church. This is what happened to Martin Lurther. He had several mental disorders like myself, but that wasn't the full problem. While a monk he received a huge amount of penance. During this time of penance there is a choice, to learn from mistakes and grow closer to God, or become cynical and harden yourself. He chose to become cynical, possibly due to his mental disorders as well. 

For all of us, especially those of us with any amount of mental disorders the best thing we can do is ignore all things except God and the saints, and to imitate God and the saints. When we focus on bringing virtue after virtue into our lives our vices will have no place and will leave naturally. The biggest thing is you cannot just give up masturbation, or give up drinking, or whatever it is that plagues you, you MUST fill that void with something else. Workout, go to church every time the door is open, start volunteering, start painting icons, add something else to your life to push out the evil. 

Tldr: Do good so you don't have time to do bad, keep pushing through the devils blocks he gives you, focus on God and the saints.",OrthodoxChristianity

Jesus sending the disciples to find a house for the Last Supper 6 days before Passover?,Public-Heretic,1619299339,"&gt;**Before the six days of the Passover**, Jesus came to Bethany, and His Disciples came to Him and say: O Lord, where wouldest Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Passover? And He sent  them, saying: Go to the town that lieth before ye, and ye shall find a man carrying a jar of water. Follow him, and say to the lord of the house: The Master saith, I shall eat the Passover with My Disciples. 

In the French translation I am reading of the liturgical services for this Sunday, this is rendered as ""Six days before the Passover"", like the passage right before:

&gt;O good Christ, when Thou didst foreshadow for us Thine exalted Resurrection, Thou didst raise  from the tomb by Thine own command Thy breathless friend Lazarus, who had been dead for 
four days, and had become decomposed. Thou didst mount symbolically upon an ass, as one borne upon a chariot, thus indicating the Gentiles. Wherefore, beloved Israel did offer Thee the praise from the mouths of innocent babes and sucklings, having beheld Thee, O Savior, entering into the holy city **six days before the Passover.**

The English translation is from the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese in America's website. 

- Why are these two passages translated differently here, but the same in another translation? Are they the same in Greek and can be interpreted either way, or are they different and the French translation is wrong?

- If they are the same in Greek, then the French translation is possible. Where then does the tradition that Jesus sent the disciples to find a house for the Last Supper 6 days before Passover come from? The gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke explicitly put that scene as happening on ""the first day of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread"" (Matthew), or on ""the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover lamb"" (Mark), or on ""the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover must be killed"" (Luke). Is there a separate tradition that this scene happened 6 days before the Passover, as opposed to one day before? Is this only found in the liturgical texts or is it also found in the Fathers? Or is it just a ""midrashic"" exegesis, as found throughout liturgical texts, since this scene and the Last Supper implicitly happen in Bethany in the gospels of Matthew and Mark (as it is set after the scene of the anointing in Bethany), while liturgically we're celebrating Jesus's resurrection of Lazarus in Bethany and, six days before the Passover, His anointing there according to the gospel of John?",OrthodoxChristianity

Patron saint Anne?,ninagracep,1619132614,"Hi, I'm in the process of choosing a patron saint and I thought of Anna (mother of Mary) because a couple of things are pointing me towards her (I don't feel like ""she chose me"" though but close enough). 

However I have a problem, it says that: ""Saint Anne is patroness of unmarried women, housewives, women in labor or who want to be pregnant, grandmothers, mothers and educators""

As I really want to get married and my worst fear is actually not to get married and not to have children the fact that she is ""patroness of unmarried women"" worries me it's like I would be bringing that upon me.

I am currently deeply under the influence of a philosophy which I invented after hearing what they did to a park in the nearby place much ago. Please help me and tell me whether is anything of this compatible with Orthodoxy and how to escape ones which are not.,Boka_BB,1619095057,"Recently some people decided to demolish a gas station near us and build a new one. They removed a few trees that were nearby together with roots because of the tanks that had to be removed.
Suddenly,my mother told me that that zone was a park (there actually are still some remnants nearby but that is just a few trees without anything special)  with benches for relaxing in the calmness.
Then I went so sad for those trees and was deeply hit so that I made a whole philosophy and literally cursed the pump. Some parts may be compatible with Orthodoxy but some parts likely are not.

Keypoints of what currently strikes me:

1. You will be punished for every sin that you do earlier or later. Maybe for 2 minutes and maybe for quadrillion years but you WILL BE. Maybe on Earth and maybe in the sky but you will.

2. You WILL be punished whatever you try to do to repair things and however you try to repent. You WILL suffer for every your sin and you cannot change that in any way.

3. You must not take any life nor pollute the environment. I literally said that I do not want to heat with wood (As I do.) and that I do not want to use electricity because we get it from burned coal (It is possible that we also use some hydroelectric electricity but it also largely prevents fish from migrating.) . I have to use electricity more or less (I could not tell you this without it!). If I have to suffer for that,I probably should just let it. Suffering is inevitable to me anyway because I kill bugs and microorganisms everyday (Or at least according to this thing that hit me.).

4. Everyone should only get as much as it deserves and if it deserves it and not any more(It is possible that this was due to the fact that I sometimes desperately want something but either prevent me from getting it or someone else prevents me or both happen,or at least partially). 

5. Nobody is an exception but God. 

I am not sure whether everyone but God should get equal treatment in other fields and I sometimes incorporate that into 4. but I am not yet certain.

How to escape this?It is so strong.

Have a good day!

Sorry, another conversion post. I know this might seem at surface level a strange concern. I am deeply attracted to the Orthodox Church and have been seriously considering conversion for about 2 years now. However, I am concerned about the effects of the dominance of Russia within the Church's tradition. I have no problem with Russian culture inherently, and I am sure much of their writings and the saints that have come from that region have produced absolute gold theologically. But I am in the American military, and their recent actions on the geopolitical stage are pretty undefendable. I also seem to see a side of militant Orthodoxy that thinks Russia is the ""new Rome"" and their positions on church unity right now give me pause (as in, all of the other Orthodox patriarchates are wrong). Additionally, I am genuinely concerned about the state of the Russian Church and its relation to the government of Putin...it appears to be essentially a political pawn at least at the highest levels. If I were to convert, does this seem like a stumbling block?

Looking for advice from someone who has knowledge of Buddhist cosmology.,eyeopenedmyeyes,1619032954,"I‚Äôm looking for advice from someone who truly understands Buddhist cosmology because I‚Äôm very drawn to orthodoxy but it seems the closer I get the more questions arise. Now I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the devil or just my own mind distracting me.

It‚Äôs a long concept so I‚Äôm looking for someone to answer this who already has previous knowledge about this. Most Buddhists claim that all prophets who worship this god in the Bible worship him because they can remember existence up until his existence but not there previous lives before he existed. I know a lot of people claim him the be the god of the Old Testament due to his ‚Äújealousy and envy‚Äù. How would you describe Maha Brahma in regards to Christian cosmology assuming that the Buddhist view about this is correct? Or do you completely disregard this cosmology, if so, why? 

I‚Äôm sorry this is kind of scrambled.

The Problem of Evil?,Odd_Noise6872,1619032617,"I have a question regarding the Orthodox view of the origin of evil that I never could get an answer on.  For context: I was raised Greek Orthodox, but left the Church as soon as I was able when I turned 18. I'm still Christian, but non-denominational/Protestant. However, I still have doubts in my faith, and what is commonly referred to as ""The Problem of Evil"" is one of them.

So my question is based on:

I understand how humans fall to temptation and choose evil. The Genesis story indicates Adam and Eve never saw the face of God, and were tempted by Satan, this makes sense to me. It also makes sense how humans on Earth fall, demons are intent on temptation, and none of us have ever seen the face of God either, and we have no ""memory"" of Eden.

But the demons? Who were with God since before the creation of the physical universe, and have seen Him face to face? Why would a being who's seen love and perfection and greatness eye to eye choose to separate itself from that forever? Why would a being who has known loving perfection, choose to reject it for all eternity? If God is really truly as loving, perfect, and great as we are supposed to believe, how is this possible?

The response I seem to always get is ""we can't know for certain the exact reasoning behind the demons did what they did, we have to trust God"". But to me, faith is not the same as blind trust.

Unhappily Converting to Orthodoxy,PomegranateNuke,1618972982,"I want to be excited for becoming Orthodox, but I'm having difficulty with it on an intellectual level. Seems like I'm going from a greater system to a lesser one, and that's very frustrating.

I don't mean that I have doubts about the truth claims or things like that. I grew up Protestant, but converted to Catholicism after finding out that I had believed many lies about it. Happily and enthusiastically converted to a system that had seemed to consider every issue that could be thrown at it.

Then with some more thought over several years, I came to the conclusion that converting to Orthodoxy was the correct thing to do due to their maintaining of the creed and not recognizing the universal jurisdiction of the Pope.

Catholicism has a large scholastic tradition that has seeped down into even popular level books for engineers like me. It feels like I am equipped to answer questions and hold my own when it comes to questions on and challenges against the faith. 

The impression I'm getting from Orthodoxy is that either the philosophy is ignored when it doesn't deal with soteriology or that it's addressed at an academic level and remains at that level. It just seems like a system without interest in engaging the world.

Testemony + Converting to Orthodoxy is hard,brazilianguyinreddit,1618972058,"This will be one of thosw ""i want to become orthodox buuuuuut..."" posts. Sorry if it feels old and tired, but i think i could really use some advice. Also, sorry if the text gets too long, and, specially, sorry if my english is sloppy at times; i speak it well but it's not my first language.

So, giving some context: i'm 18 years old, latin american. I was raised in a family which is basically divided beetween catholicism, protestantism and spiritism; religious differences always caused some tensions within my family ( catholics and protestants, regardless of blood relations, will bicker from time to time; the spiritists don't start fights, but they are often criticized by the christian part of the family ). My immediate family is catholic.

I myself was never quite religious; i stopped going to church as soon as my mother gave me some choice in the matter ( when i was around 15 ), i am baptized but not confirmed, and i was functionally an atheist for most of my short life ( i didn't openly identify as an atheist out of fear of rejection, but i had no faith at all ). But recently, something just changed inside of me. I love History, and i'm going to college to become a historian very soon; and studiying the history of christianity out of curiosity just awoke something inside of me. It was very gradual, very subtle, and i can't pinpoint the exact moment when i became a believer. I just felt a calling, and here i am, more convinced of the truth of Jesus Christ with each day! And all in the timespan of about a full year.

Initially, this represented my return to the Catholic Church, and i currently identify as catholic. But the thing is...i'm really attracted by Orthodox Christianity. I could write an entire text about my reasons alone, but to keep it short: my studies showed me that there's much factual basis to the Church's allegations of apostolic sucession and being the same of faith of the first christians. And of course, i just feel different in relation to Orthodoxy; i feel...good. Specially good! It ressonates with me in a personal level.

Ok, that was the ""i want to become orthodox"" part. Now, let's go to the ""buuuuut..."" part. Faith-wise, there's nothing stopping me from becoming orthodox; but there's a lot of pratical problems that discourage me:

1- Orthodoxy is 100% exotic to my family, and explaining my decision to them would be/will be very, very hard. As i said, the spiritist ""faction"" ( i lack a better word ) of my family is really, really chill, but i can expect some strong opossition from the catholic and protestant ones. Add to this the fact that i'm very young and lack true independency in a lot of aspects of my life, and you get the picture

2- There are very few Orthodox Churches in my state ( and one of them is Oriental Orthodox, not Eastern Orthodox ), so locomotion is a problem on it's own.

3- I feel like orthodox communities in my country are very ethnicity-oriented. I'm not greek, russian, polish or lebanese ( these are the patriarchies active in my country; lebanese-antiochian is the biggest one ).  These immigrant communities are very tight-knit, kinda closed, and even though i doubt the actual priest would object my conversion ( i'm actually pretty certain the priest would help me ), i feel like i would have a hard time getting the community to trust/accept me. For those who live in countries where orthodoxy is a minority/linked to immigration: did you fit right in, or did they treat you like you were an intruder in an immigrant clique ?

So, my path to true conversion will problably be greatly delayed ( maybe in some years even ). I will keep studiying and observing the orthodox faith in the meantime. Until i can actually convery, i'll keep publicy identifiying as catholic and attend catholic mass ( dunno if it's wrong or anything, but i want to still have a christian life until then ).

So, that's it...sorry again! I just needed to talk about this, and this seemed like the right place. I'm aware that it would problably be more helpfull if i wrote this in a orthodox forum of my own country/language, but the thing is, it seems like this forum does not exist.

Question from a Baptist,NathiasCross,1618968008,"I‚Äôm Protestant and attend a Baptist church that‚Äôs part of the Southern Baptist Convention.
Within the past week or so, I‚Äôve wondered more about what Orthodox Christianity is.
As in:

- What are the beliefs of Orthodox Christians that set them apart from other Christians?

- How close are the main beliefs of Orthodox Christianity to the main beliefs of Roman Catholicism?

- Does Orthodox Christians believe that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone?

If anyone has the answer to any of the questions above, please respond if you feel like it. If not, have a great day.

Orthodoxy in my School,tedk170,1618963752,"So there's a Christian discussion group of sorts at my high school and I will be speaking at the next meet. I already have a sermon put together, and I plan on becoming more active there. I'm in an odd situation though. I am being drawn towards the Orthodox Church, but I can't convert, since my parents don't want me to yet. I've been raised in an evangelical protestant church and all of my family is protestant. In addition, pretty much all of the people in this group are protestant or new to Christianity. I am wanting to introduce them to Orthodoxy, but I don't know if I am in the position to be doing this. I have been reading and learning everything I can about the faith, and I've been using a prayer book and a prayer rope for some time now. I've been in the process of learning for almost a year. Though I don't know if I am fit to bring this to other people yet since I am not officially a part of the church. So basically, as someone who isn't Orthodox yet, can I lead others to the church?",OrthodoxChristianity

The more I believe in God the smaller I feel.,Marsmars936,1618950331,"Sorry if this is a longer post. I grew up in an atheist household but began to look into Christianity when I was 18 (20 now) because I felt lost in life. My view on Christianity was veryyyy different then, because I really I just saw it as a book of fables meant to convey morals and help people get through life than an actually divinely inspired book, I saw Jesus as just a philosopher, the holy spirit as the energy of the universe, and I was very agnostic on whether or not there was actually a God the Father, Pretty much due to my upbringing and being told that Christianity was just made up nonsense I was trying to filter it through my brain in a way that at least I could somewhat pretend made sense. Since then however After looking into several arguments for God and explanations  etc. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that there IS a God, there are angels, and that Jesus is the Son of God and God the Son and that the bible is true. It was a pretty long road to getting here but I don‚Äôt want to make this too long so I‚Äôll leave it at that for now.

Ok so with that out of the way here is the problem that I‚Äôm facing, now that I believe in God and his grand plan, I feel so small and this sense of powerlessness, like before I felt overwhelmed by how much was in the world, like life was a giant field with no instructions and nowhere to go, but now its the opposite extreme. This is gonna sound dumb but the best way I can explain it is before felt like playing an open world game where you decide what quests you want to do it what order, and now life feels like a game I‚Äôm playing in campaign mode. Not so much that everything is preplanned, but the feeling of there being an omnipotent force directing the world just fills me with an unexplainable dread. Is this what the bible meant when it said ‚ÄúThe fear of God is the beginning of wisdom‚Äù? Has anyone else ever felt like this?",OrthodoxChristianity
I can't make up my mind,nejld,1618944091,"Raised an atheist, I recently found Christianity and have been doing catechism (orthodox and catholic), questioning, exploring etc. I've been set on entering the church, however I cannot make up my mind between catholicism and orthodoxy. I'm scared I'm never gonna choose a path and being in between chairs is weighing on me. 

I'm really attracted to orthodoxy, it feels more real and meaningful to me, also it's trivial I know I can use icons if I'm a catholic but icons really speak to me. I'm not set on the dogmas like I do prefer the orthodox way but I haven't thought about it enough to have a real opinion. I feel like Orthodox theologians nail it on the head more often than Catholics for some reason. I went to church for catholic pascha and didnt feel anything whereas I've been following mass in a orthodox church and it always resonates with me but I don't want to base my decision on that since it's probably just differences between parishes. I would convert to orthodoxy without hesitation if I was from an orthodox country but being from France it feels like I'm cutting myself from my roots and ancestors. Catholicism feels more mine whereas I feel like maybe I don't belong in the orthodox church like I don't have the legitimacy to be an orthodox in a way, I would be betraying a part of myself and my identity. Maybe part of me would like to be an orthodox over a catholic just bc of so many catholics say stupid things and the drama is more prominent and I guess part of me wouldn't want to be associated with this but I know you can find the same pb in orthodoxy it's a shallow way to choose a religion. Right now I'm in North America where it's easy to attend mass at either church but if I come back to France it might be harder for orthodox services but maybe not.

Don't Look at the Fish Woman!,Pingantu,1618931517,"Every year for many years I‚Äôve volunteered to work in the parking service for our St. George church festival.  Thousands of people come every year over the course of three days to eat falafel, lamb shank and baklava.  A good-natured Ethiopian volunteer works with me every year.  Before there was an Ethiopian church in our city, the Ethiopian community attended our Church and this man tries to give back every year by working in parking at our festival.  We have become good friends and enjoy each other‚Äôs company every year.  

Now, parking can be challenging.  People show up grumpy, hot, tired and hungry. Sometimes they don‚Äôt listen to you.  One year as we stood talking I said something like, ‚ÄúWhat is wrong with these people?  Don‚Äôt they know we are volunteers?‚Äù to which he immediately and effortlessly replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for that‚Äù.  
Later at some point as we stood in the grassy field talking about a wide variety of topics and waving on cars, he told me a story.  An Ethiopian folk story.  It goes like this:

There once was a man in Ethiopia whose village fell upon hard times.  A famine had come to his country and it was so bad, he had to leave his young family to go work in a far-away foreign country so he could send money back to his family to eat.  
Of course, this man was willing to do anything for his family so he worked very hard for many years sending everything he could back to his family.  Year after year he worked tirelessly but alas, after many years, the company he worked for closed when the bosses suddenly took all the money and fled.  
The man was reduced to nothing but at least he did have 30 dollars he had stuffed in his mattress.  Distraught, he headed back for home with his $30.  All the money he had saved for himself was not a lot.  He basically had nothing.  As there was no post service and no cell phones in those days, he didn‚Äôt even know how his family was doing. 

On the way home, he wondered how he would approach his family.  He had nothing to give them beyond what he had sent month after month.  

While on the way, he met an old prophet at the roadside.  
‚ÄúWhat have you to ask?‚Äù asked the prophet.  ‚ÄúIs my family still alive?‚Äù, he replied. 
‚ÄúThat I cannot tell you.  But I can tell you three things necessary to finish your journey successfully. But, it will cost you everything you have.  I surmise you have $30.  Each advice will cost you $10‚Äù.
First, he thought of all the dangers on the way back to his village and how many ways he might die, and how he might starve to death.  But having so little and nothing left to lose, he thought‚Ä¶ why not?  
‚ÄúOk, what is the first secret?‚Äù as he handed over the first $10.
‚ÄúThe first secret, my son, is to never take shortcuts‚Äù.
He didn‚Äôt know what to make of this advice but he was already committed and pulled out another 10 dollars.  
‚ÄúThe second secret, Father?‚Äù, He asked.
‚ÄúThe second secret, my son is to mind your own business‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd the third?‚Äù, he said handing over the last of his lifeline.  
‚ÄúThe third secret: Don‚Äôt rush to judgement.  Do what I say and all will be well, my son‚Äù.  
The prophet disappeared for a moment but caught up to the man presenting him an envelope.  
‚ÄúI charge you, do not open this envelope until you have returned home and all is accomplished‚Äù.
On the journey, he was beset by worries.  He had nothing but thought he must try to get home as quickly as possible in order to survive.  On the road home he asked a fellow traveler directions on how to arrive to his home as quickly as possible.  
‚ÄúThe fastest way to your village is to cross this suspension bridge and return home from there.‚Äù, he said pointing to the bridge.  
The man looked at it.  It looked dangerous but he thought about the fact that he had no food or money and wanted to chance it.  However, he remembered the first advice of the old prophet to never take shortcuts.  After pondering this a while, he decided to take the long way around.  Just then a deer darted onto the suspension bridge only to fall victim as it snapped and fell into the raging river below. 
He continued his journey.  As he progressed, he began to starve.  He arrived into a very strange country with a very strange people.  The people in the village told him they were unable to give him food at the command of the ruler this country.  There was only one person who could give food and that was the ruler of the country.  They said he had great wealth and much food, but that he must be wary, many people who go there never return.
Starving and with not a choice left, he went to see the ruler of the land.  He approached the murderer in humility.  As he entered, all around the throne room were severed heads, body parts, and gory things from other people who came before.  And just next to the ruler sat a half-fish half-woman Queen.
‚ÄúWhy have you come to see me‚Äù, said the ruler.  ‚ÄúI have no food, my lord. I am traveling home to my family who I have not seen for many years and will die soon without food‚Äù.  
‚ÄúWhat do you see?‚Äù, said the ruler eyeing him carefully.  
‚ÄúNothing, my lord.  I only desire food for my journey‚Äù.  
At this, the king was overjoyed and spread a great banquet to feed the man lavishly.  During the feast, the king explained to the man that all of the murdered men hanging all around had immediately asked him about his half-fish, half-woman wife as they entered.  ‚ÄúThey came to me for help and dare to ask me my  business?‚Äù, he said.  After the dinner, the king was so impressed he gave the man half of his wealth.  
Now rich, the man continues the long journey home and finally arrives at his home village.  
As he approached his home from a distance he sees a man with his wife in their house.  Enraged, he starts walking faster toward the house and can‚Äôt believe his wife remarried after he worked for so many years.  But suddenly he remembers the third secret.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt rush to judgement‚Äù. 
Resisting anger he walks off into the bush and beds down for the night.
The next day he decided to calmly deal with the situation.  Upon entering the house he sees the man, who was his oldest son all grown up with his wife who both joyously embraced him.  
He told them all about his adventures and shows them the letter from the old prophet.  He remembered to not open it until he arrived home.  When he opened it, it contained the $30 he had paid for the secrets.   
So‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt look at the fish woman.  Just do your job that you went there to do with neither judgement nor curiosity and continue on the journey home. Otherwise, you can put yourself in great danger",OrthodoxChristianity

Film and cinematography is iconographic,Classic_Result,1618913808,"Take this as a way to explain iconography to your friends and family, take it as an academic insight...

Film, especially movies because they have to compress far more than TV series, is iconographic. What you're looking at isn't a ""real"" or ""realistic"" fight scene, it isn't a ""realistic"" romance, it isn't what would ""really"" happen, it's a compact representation of how things would go.

Icons are often compact. Look at an icon of the Nativity. The Three Wise Men weren't riding their camels around the hill between them and the stable in which Christ was born, shepherds and angels converging on the site, all that the same time, for the iconographer to catch. Neither do people fall in love in an epic dating montage.

When you have the ""happily ever after"" scene in which the hero's family and friends gather around him as he collapses after the climactic running gun battle isn't ""realistic,"" it's iconographic.

When you have those interesting camera angles in which a conversation illuminates what some character in the background is doing, it's iconographic.

Realizing this helped me understand cinematography better, but it works the other way as well. People today will recognize the validity of cinematography but they may not ""get"" how iconography works.

Movies aren't academic arguments, they are depictions of the ""human reality"" including feelings and moral development -- irrespective of how things like that would happen in ""real life."" Icons depict what God has done or accomplished. The icon of the Resurrection doesn't present three proofs for it from an apologist, it shows the theological (and moral, emotional, etc.) meaning of the event.",OrthodoxChristianity

I chose Saint Patrick as my RC patron saint because, at the time, I thought I was going to become a priest and it was my desire to transfer to Ireland and help the dying RC church there.

Curious about Orthodoxy,Yarus43,1618895307," I was raised baptiste by my mother, but when I turned 13 I fell out of the religion. My father was Catholic, as was his father. His side of the family was from northern Italy, specifically Bologna. To be honest, ive thought about going to a catholic church, but I wasn't sure about the idea of the pope being the say all of the church.   
  I know Orthodoxy is typically a more eastern religion in europe, although I am very ignorant to its laws, and principles. All I know about Orthodox is that it bears Constantine's symbol, and was popular in Eastern Rome, and the Kievan Rus. 

  I am very interested in its history, and differences from the Catholic church. My interest is somewhat historically based, but Christianity has been somewhat appealing to me lately on a more personal level. 

  Is it generally abnormal for americans to be orthodox? specifically if they only speak say english? What are the core principles in the worship of Christ, and God?

I am single guy in my mid to late twenties, and I have visited this church in the area about three times now and will not be able to be there any more after Palm Sunday for work purposes (I will have to travel to different churches as I work for a para-ecclesial organization). My first time there, I briefly met this girl who seems to be my age who was there with her mom, dad, and brother.  There was not much other than some of the nice pleasantries typically exchanged when introduced to someone new but she specifically stayed behind to welcome me and say hello which raised my brow in a good way. After a very brief conversation, she commented on the fact that we grew up and live in the same area. We kept making eye contact but never had the chance to really chat more given that fellowship is non existent with COVID. The priest was my classmate in undergrad and a buddy of mine who is filling in at the parish and says that he doesn't know her well since he is new but that she is there every service....

SO my question....would it be totally wrong for me to catch her at the end of service on Sunday, ask if she has a second, and tell her that it was nice to meet her and that I would love to grab a cup a coffee or something after Pascha?

Questions about Orthodox,jacobmarksmith693,1618877654,"There seems to be few resources about Orthodoxy online, and even fewer that come from within the church itself. So I figured here my be the place for some answers. I understand the Orthodox Church is less centralized than the Roman Catholic church so some answers will likely vary by region. Looking up Orthodox Catholic Church often just brings up results primarily based on Roman Catholic Church, or how they are different, and that seems to really only touch the tip of the iceberg of what the Orthodox Church is/believes in. I was looking for individuals experiences and knowledge primarily from the West coast, as that is were I live, but personal knowledge and experience from those outside the region are welcome as well. 
How in line with the Roman Catholic Church are the views of the Orthodox Church on such things as; 
   - Women in the church? Mother, religious leader, subservient to their husbands, etc.?
   - Sterilization, Abortion, Birth control, IVF, and any other medical doctrine?
       (I don't know if there are others I am not aware of that apply to either males or females, feel free to mention them.)
   - Limitations on who they will marry, such as those who can't consummate a marriage.
   - LGBT+ community
   - Animal's souls (a bit silly perhaps, but curious regardless)

Do you pray the rosary? I have seen something that looks like a rosary online that came up when searching Orthodoxy, but it was made of knots instead of beads, why the difference?

What is the significance of the saints in the church, I know they are important, and they can be prayed to, but are they God's missionaries, messengers, just people that God worked through in life to show his presence?

Why can priests get married and not monks? Do priests have to be married before they are ordained, or can they get married after they become priests as well? Can nuns get married? or is there a separate order/class like the monks vs priests that can get married?

Why is the calendar used for holidays for the Roman Catholic church, and Eastern Orthodox Church different? I understand they work on the Gregorian vs Juliun calenders of the year, but why?

The Roman Catholic church had the scandal with the priests abusing children, did the Eastern Orthodox Church have that as well, or a different version of that, and how did it effect the Church, or you as a member of the Church itself?

Those who were born into the faith, how has that effected your life, and those who converted same question, but also how did you come to be a part of the Church?
  
I like the Orthodox Church because of its active practice of faith, it often seems like going to church isn't really worshipping, but reminding  people there is even a God they should worship. The traditions, and active roles that take place during service and reverence for anything that is linked to God, or the saints is something I find refreshing. I didn't actually know anything but a passing acknowledgement of the Orthodox Church, though I live only about 13mins away from one. Doing research into Orthodoxy has proven it quite difficult to find resources, websites that talk about orthodoxy do so mainly through scripture. Which is fine, but it feels like diving into the deep end, I don't entirely understand the significance of everything I am reading and how it relates to me, and God, and the Church. I have order a Orthodox study Bible to hopefully fill in the blanks, and have a deeper understanding. Book suggestions, or online resources for a beginner would be appreciated.

I was once attracted to the Libertarian party because I thought the best we could hope from government was to preserve the freedom of the church from government overreach.

I've since been attracted to the American Solidarity Party because it seems too be better aligned to my personal values.

But now I'm asking myself whether I want the government to ""be the church"" in a way. Do I want the government to coerce people to be moral or ethical, or is it much better to have people voluntarily choose to be so? Would I have the government meet everyone's basic social/economic needs and take over the role of charity in the church?

Should the government encourage monogamy? Enforce it? Or should people be encouraged to have healthy relationships by their local parish/priest/bishop and given freedom to live without harming others as they live outside of the communion of the church?

I'm wondering what I want the government to be. And then I'm wondering if I should even care rather than focusing on my own family and my own spiritual development. Is it my place to decide the rules for the rest of society? Should we make everyone look like us even if they aren't?

Are there good examples of what faithful Christians have done in representative democracies in church history?

Bishops and abbotts have the role of administrator. Organization is something that needs to be done, even by the original deacons. But deacons, abbotts, and bishops are organizing the faithful. They aren't managing people who belong to another (or no) creed.

Should we just stay out of politics or seek after preserving the church's freedom only? Should we seek to shape society in such a way as to minimize suffering (as we see it) even if it also reduces freedom for people who don't share the same values?",OrthodoxChristianity

Reflections on conversion and a question.,Mateep,1618836389,"Hello friends! I am writing this post to share the experience that led to my conversion and also ask some questions. 

First off, I have been baptized Eastern Orthodox in infancy. For most of my life, I have not practiced my faith, although I have been searching many places for meaning. When I was in high school, I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor for which I have had multiple surgeries up to now, that also left me with hypopituitarism and moderate loss of vision. As you can imagine, it was a very devastating experience for me that really made me question a lot of things.

Fast forward to 2021, I‚Äôm 23 years old and, after a period of mental suffering, I have decided to take up prayer again, even beginning to read the Philokalia. About a month ago, I woke up and went to sit on the couch when I was overcome with an intense burning feeling in my heart and also an overflowing love. It moved me to tears, and, in that moment, I just intuitively knew that God exists. Since that moment I can feel that love and burning every time I pray, although to a lesser extent. I have begun going to the Divine Liturgy and I am strongly contemplating the monastic life. Ever since that moment, I have begun losing interest in all things worldly.

My question is: Is it true that God sends diseases as punishment for one‚Äôs sins or the sins of our ancestors?

The relationship of Judaism in the Orthodox Church,Level_End418,1618814231,"I apologize for annoying this sub again with slightly differing phrasing of the same question, it must get tiring to keep responding, but I am writing a very long essay on the relationship between my own faith (Judaism) and the other abrahamic religions and how they have historically interacted with and perceived each other and this question is something I will need a definitive yes or no answer on if I am to continue. Does Christianity in it's apostolic form maintain that Jews observing torah based commandments such as shabbos or kashrus have any merit in the eyes of the Christian conception of G-d? The reason I have kept posing this seemingly obvious question, is that the general sentiment of pre-modern Christians as can be found in the writings and personal habits of Paul, as well as the council of Florence and Nicea, and the popular Christian perception of Judaism at the time, in response to Judaizing heresy seems to be definitively supersessionist in the most explicit way possible; evident through the writings of Thomas Aquinas and other Christian scholars such as Ephrem the Syrian and the forced conversions of Jews in primarily Orthodox nations Nicholas II and various periods through the history of Ethiopia (don't think that I harbor ill will to any of you for this, it's not like you are responsible for what happened).

I was able to conclusively affirm that this was an almost universally held opinion among Christians with this statement from the fifteenth century: ""**It firmly believes, professes and teaches that the legal prescriptions of the old Testament or the Mosaic law, which are divided into ceremonies, holy sacrifices and sacraments, because they were instituted to signify something in the future, although they were adequate for the divine cult of that age, once our lord Jesus Christ who was signified by them had come, came to an end and the sacraments of the new Testament had their beginning. Whoever, after the passion, places his hope in the legal prescriptions and submits himself to them as necessary for salvation and as if faith in Christ without them could not save, sins mortally**. It does not deny that from Christ‚Äôs passion until the promulgation of the gospel they could have been retained, provided they were in no way believed to be necessary for salvation. **But it asserts that after the promulgation of the gospel they cannot be observed without loss of eternal salvation**. **Therefore it denounces all who after that time observe circumcision, the sabbath and other legal prescriptions as strangers to the faith of Christ and unable to share in eternal salvation, unless they recoil at some time from these errors.** **Therefore it strictly orders all who glory in the name of Christian, not to practice circumcision either before or after baptism, since whether or not they place their hope in it, it cannot possibly be observed without loss of eternal salvation.""**

But the current Christian community seems to be actively reforming and dismantling this doctrine as evident in modern Judaizing movements such as Messianic Christianity and the statements of many modern Christian theologians seem to be increasingly receptive to the idea of Mosaic law being applicable to the Jewish people. I have found this to be evident in these statements made by the Vatican which seem to be positively received in both Catholic and non Catholic liberal Christian circles, for example, a speech by John Paul II in 1980 of which relevant quotes I will insert seems to be one affirmative of this theological doctrine: ""The first dimension of this dialogue, that is, the encounter between the people of God of the Old Covenant, never denounced by God (cf. Rom 11:29), and that of the New Covenant, is at the same time a dialogue within the our Church, so to speak between the first and second parts of his Bible. In this regard, the directives for the application of the conciliar declaration ""Nostra Aetate"" say: ""We will try to better understand everything that in the Old Testament retains its own and perpetual value ..., since this value has not been obliterated by the further interpretation of the New Testament, which on the contrary gave the Old its most complete meaning, so that the New reciprocally receives light and explanation from the Old ""(Nostra Aetate, II)"". The famous second Vatican council document Nostra Aetate that he referenced, could also be interpretive as affirmative of the belief in the Mosaic covenants relevancy to Israel. This sentiment also seems to be confirmed by some iterations of the modern Roman Catholic catechism which I cannot find at the moment and Pope Francis's effort at dialogue with the Jewish community and his controversial view that my religion has the ability to be saved.

I have found further evidence of this sentiment in the trends of Protestant Christianity, as rites from my own faith such as the seder or observance of modified forms of shabbos seem to be finding their way in Evangelicalism particularly but also in established churches such as the Anglican Church of England. In case your wondering, I am posting this on an Orthodox sub btw because Orthodoxy at least from the perspective of an outsider seems to be the denomination that has experienced the least doctrinal and liturgical modification, and therefore might be able to opine a perspective that is more aligned to the traditionalist point of view of the earlier church. From your perspective, should Jews keep the mosaic law and not necessarily enter the church as certain forms of Protestant dual covenant theology would indicate, are Jews required to keep the Mosaic law in a modified manner and join the Orthodox Church, or must Jews actively abandon the Mosaic covenant or at most maintain it in the form of tradition as opposed to religious obligation like the Ethiopian Orthodox have done and adopt pure Christianity?

We are asked not to kiss icons and instead bow due to covid and also use QR codes and sit in family bubbles. It just doesn't make sense to me.

Meekness and masculinity,Outrageous-Ad-1100,1618684613,"Hi guys, 

I seem to find it hard in how to be a masculine and meek at the same time. 

It‚Äôs no secret there is a masculinity crisis nowadays in society. 

Men far from God act overly submissive to other man and more so to women. The more sinful they are (due to pornography for example) the more feminized they become. 

On the contrary, when secular men start to live virtuous lifestyle - no sex, narcotics, overeating, greed, start training etc. they become more masculine - positively competitive, initiating social interactions, leading other man, taking charge for the better of the social structure and country. These qualities and lifestyle require strong efforts, give justice to the world and make you a responsible asset of society. Also is something women find attractive.

This is what I actually imagine a strong Old Testament men look like.

However, they don‚Äôt represent meekness which christians are called to. 
When I lead a diligent Christian lifestyle and especially when I receive God‚Äôs Grace, I feel the real presence of God in me and become somewhat focused inwards. I speak with a soft voice, feel I am disrespecting God if I start to dominate conversations, be proactive in social situations. I feel that I am somehow loosing Grace for even trivial things like doing high intensity physical actions. 

I have noticed the Russian priests speak a lot in the regard ‚Äúlet‚Äôs save the family unit and make men strong and chaste women‚Äù which is really a beautiful thing, needed today and is something which a lot of young men and women will leave their promiscuous ways for! However, this is not so much of Christianity. 

Or ... is it? I read Elder Paisos and he says that the Family life is a blessed one if you create an Orthodox one. Also he says that men need masculinity to ‚Äútake care of their business and reign over the woman‚Äù (in a beautiful way of course). 

Also, I read in Matthew 19:12 that the rich person went to Christ and He told him to follow the commandments and love his brothers and will be enough to be saved. But if he wants to be perfect to leave everything and follow Him. I understood this like follow the Old Testament ideal (not to be promiscuous for example) but if you want to become perfect - follow the Beatitudes to receive big reward. Maybe I am not understanding it correctly and He speaks for taking the monastic life.

Also, I take into considerations
 there are nuances - when I decide to focus on big things - not fornicating let‚Äôs say, I feel it‚Äôs not such big issue to be acting a little bit more ‚Äútough‚Äù, not so much Grace is lost from the hearth. Also, it makes sense if you feel God presence in you to be more meek after drinking holy water, the same way you‚Äôll be more careful if a King or high official is present in the room.

Thank you, would love if you help me in this struggle.",OrthodoxChristianity
What are your thoughts on the conversion of Roy Schoeman?,MeringueFriendly8205,1618680463,"For anyone who is not familiar, Roy Schoeman was a Harvard professor, and is now a Jewish convert to Catholicism after having an intense experience of God's presence, followed by a later encounter with the Blessed Virgin Mary in the form of a dream. Previously, he says that he knew next to nothing about Christianity, and had never even touched a New Testament (let alone read one). In [this](https://youtu.be/EMvqKmPpDic?t=2443) interview, he was questioned why he chose to become Catholic over Orthodox, and his answer was, ""If I were Greek or if I were in Russia, I probably would have become Eastern Orthodox,"" and that he ""just took the path of least resistance"" in joining the Catholic Church: ""I wanted Mary and I wanted the Eucharist, and if you live in Massachusetts, you've gotta be Catholic for that."" He also went on to say that Apostolic Christianity, as opposed to just Catholicism, is the fulfillment of Judaism. So obviously, this guy would be pretty open to Orthodoxy being true. However, I've noticed there are some things which he reports the Blessed Virgin telling him which could potentially rub strongly against Orthodox ears.

For one, when he questioned Mary as to what her favorite prayer to her was, he says that she responded in Portuguese; but because he did not know any Portuguese, he had to remember the first few syllables phonetically and write them down when he woke up. Later on, after meeting a Portuguese Catholic woman, identified it as being the prayer written on the Miraculous Medal: ""O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee."" (Although he is not 100% certain that this was the prayer. In [this](https://youtu.be/VXP8rVo4O44?t=1883) interview, he stated, ""I don't want to bet my salvation on it; but my best guess is, that was the prayer."")

Another part of his testimony that might be difficult to fit with Orthodox theology would be Mary's response when he asked her the question, ""What's this business about the Holy Spirit?"" According to him, ""her response was simply to look upwards with an expression melting with love and say, 'He's His gaze,"" which he today believes to be a reference to the Thomistic idea that the Spirit is ""the look of love that passes between the Father and the Son,"" a connection which he makes [here](https://youtu.be/1vnoKr3htss?t=1504).

So my question is, what are some different Orthodox responses to all of this? Do you believe that it is legitimate, or do you think that it is all a hoax? (Personally, after having watched several interviews with him, I have every reason to believe that his experience was genuine.) Do you think there is a chance that he misunderstood this Portuguese prayer for a similar-sounding Russian one, seeing how alike the languages are phonetically? And if you do believe that he is genuine, how do you interpret what he quotes Mary as saying about the Holy Spirit?",OrthodoxChristianity

Reconnecting with my religion,heythereruth,1618665876,"I'm raised Ethiopian orthodox (a little different than the forms practiced in Europe), and I sort of started having doubts a few years after my family moved to Europe.

One of the main reasons why was the way christianity is portrayed here : 

- The catholic church has apparently had tons of allegations of abuse and corruptions of power which everyone in school would use to discredit christianity 

- Many christians had already made very ""showy"" and over the top exclamation of being morally superior than everyone because of their beliefs and their ""deeds"" (something that is Very looked down upon in ethiopian orthodox) which a lot of non-christians people resented (and I agree) 

- The homophobia - which i'm not saying does not exist in orthodoxy, but before moving here I had never heard at church make any comments about it. We usually would just pray for everyone, and not have tons of sermons of interpretations 

Now I'm not bashing christians here for my doubts (lol) but in reaction to the representation of christianity, a lot of my friends would make fun/ and question everything related to it : 
- Like does everyone who doesn't believe in God/ Jesus go to hell?
- why is it fair that the God would punish people for loving who they want 
- Why is it fair that christians get to judge what is deemed inappropriate based on their beliefs 
- the way christianity was 'propagated' through violence

it's a very long story but I've kind of gotten very deep into the LGBT community recently, almost all of my friends are lgbt and I came to realize I was asexual. when i first met most of them I tried to be a good friend and seemingly support them, but over time I saw myself wondering why being lgbt (in any way) is bad. I've slowly come to the conclusion that being asexual (I use the term because I have no other name for it) makes me lgbt, while it was hard to accept at first I've come to terms with the implications the term gives. I've recently gotten into a relationship with a person whom I love, they're atheist but respect my religion which is as much as I can ask for.

the problem:

I'm not sure when or why exactly I started questioning my faith. I've always run scenarios in my head about what if x happened, and some of those scenarios were ""what if one day I die and there is no God?"" it made me feel really scared and alone so I always pushed it aside and thought that I can believe that He is real and that thought that he was made me feel not so alone. like there was always someone there, always someone on my side, which He is. I took comfort in knowing that.

However, the last few years have been hard for me spiritually and emotionally. My original orthodox church, which I joined in 2012, began to change and became something like an odd cross between Judaism and western rite Orthodoxy. I left the church in 2018. I am now at another Orthodox church (greek, eastern rite) which is much better for me. I've made some wonderful friends there and it is helping me thrive spiritually. However, a friend of mine whom I met there died last year, followed by my great uncle. I took these losses hard. I've also struggled with anxiety and my self image, I've started to be online more which has lead me to question my faith. As mentioned above, I've struggled with my sexuality (or lack thereof).

I met my now-best friend, who is trans, and I've inadvertently become surrounded by wonderful people who happen to be lgbt, including my boyfriend. I was always taught that (I don't know if this is true but this is my experience) that all people who act on feeling as though they're lgbt are committing a terrible sin, and I was always taught this automatically means that they will go to Hell. I can't wrap my brain around this thought, my best friend is genuinely the nicest human being I've ever had the blessing to meet and I cannot fathom that he would spend eternity there. It doesn't seem fair that so many of the kindest people I know would, no matter what they do, by acting upon being lgbt be automatically sent there. It's one of the main struggles I'm having, I simply cannot understand why that would happen.

Conclusion:

This whole ordeal makes me feel like such a terrible person. When I have to explain to people that I'm asexual, it comes with a lot of implications that I've learned to identify with, which makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. I really don't know if I am.

Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor's crown. Revelation 2:10

For it is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. 1 Peter 3:17

However this gets lost with a lot Christians since most of them are residing in developed countries where persecution is very unlikely but the Bible is very clear that that is unnatural at least for the Christians at that time.

Nevertheless a lot of Christians do also believe that suffering is used a sanctification process to make you more holy. This is a lot more common in Catholicism. And because of the emphasis for suffering in the Gospel you seen a lot in the early church people seeking martyrdom and purposely making leaders upset to get killed. A long with phrases going around ""the blood of the martyrs are the seeds of the church"". ""Spiritual discipline"" included whipping/harming your to atone for past errors and sins as well.‚Äù

"St. Epiphanius of Salamis and the ""Curtain Incident""",GStuart31,1618572807,"In a letter considered by historians to not be a forgery, unlike actual forgeries of his works produced by Iconoclasts, St Epiphanius wrote to Bishop John II of Jerusalem

&gt;Moreover, I have heard that certain persons have this grievance against me: When I accompanied you to the holy place called Bethel, there to join you in celebrating the Collect, after the use of the Church, I came to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there. Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ‚Äôs church contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort‚Äîopposed as they are to our religion‚Äîshall not be hung up in any church of Christ. A man of your uprightness should be careful to remove an occasion of offence unworthy alike of the Church of Christ and of those Christians who are committed to your charge. Beware of Palladius of Galatia‚Äîa man once dear to me, but who now sorely needs God's pity‚Äîfor he preaches and teaches the heresy of Origen; and see to it that he does not seduce any of those who are intrusted to your keeping into the perverse ways of his erroneous doctrine. I pray that you may fare well in the Lord.

Converting for marriage,Mrboatpaint,1618527739,"Hello excuse the title it is only half relevant here. My girlfriend is baptised orthodox and would like a church wedding. I was brought up in a Protestant culture but don't ascribe to any denomination. Until meeting her I knew little about orthodoxy and have been reading up on it. I've struggled back and forth on my beliefs in God and Jesus and can solidly say I believe in them. But, pardon the cliche, I remain skeptical of churches due to the weakness of man, who run the church so to speak.

We were discussing marriage and she informed me in her country a church marriage is not recognised unless both are orthodox, now I'm not saying I will get baptised as a formality for marriage as in my eyes it's a HUGE commitment. 

 I'm quite happy for our future children to be baptised as well. She is the love of my life and I would do anything for her and have been reading intros to orthodoxy the passed few nights to educate myself. Recently learnt about how praying to saints is not idolatry as you are simply asking them to pray on your behalf like you would any person. If I were to get baptised I'd take it very seriously and research as much as I could before taking such a decision as it's not about marriage or keeping my future wife happy it's about my eternal soul.

I was wondering if you guys can help me out in soothing this skepticism regarding the orthodox church, as (in my view) all denominations have some degree of corruption and I can't reconcile this with the ""true church of God"" so to speak because shouldn't the true church be free of corruption?

I hope none of this seems insensitive because as I said I wouldn't commit to orthodoxy just for marriage only if it felt right for me and if so apologies excuse my ignorance.",OrthodoxChristianity

I have a question about the prayer of St. Philaret of Moscow,booooimaghost,1618520882,"Specifically the line that says ‚ÄúIn unforeseen events, let me not forget that all are sent by You‚Äù.

Is this supposed to mean that everyone we interact with is sent into our lives by God?  What about those people who are doing the devils work?  And what about free will?

Now that I think about it a bit more and put it into writing, I think the following is now how I interpret it...

I think it could mean to remind us that it can be anyone or anything that serves as a sign or interaction with God or his messengers and those He does His will through.

The ‚Äúall are sent by Him‚Äù, means not that everybody you meet is directly sent by him necessarily, but that all types of people are those that God may use

I do really love this prayer it‚Äôs one of my favorites and in my morning routine.  This quote confused me, but through this post I think I have worked it out myself and understand it better.  I will still post this though for any other feedback or input anyone may have on the topic.

A different set of questions about Orthodoxy and Macro-Evolution,Penniless-Theologian,1618512246,"(Current) Protestant here, though I had a couple of questions about Orthodoxy that I don‚Äôt see asked anywhere else. More specifically, this is for those Orthodox Christians who believe that a belief in Macro-Evolution is compatible with Orthodoxy. 
To avoid the ‚Äúdead horse‚Äù warning in the FAQ, I want to make clear that this isn‚Äôt about what the Church teaches, but how specific aspects of it‚Äôs teaching relate to Macro-Evolution.

1. I realize that there is no dogmatic position on Macro-Evolution in the Orthodox Church, but how does one reconcile the theory with the teachings of the Orthodox Saints since the 19th century who opposed it? Could they all have just been wrong?

2. I have also heard that there was a declaration at one of the Ecumenical Church councils stating that there was no death before the fall, so then how could an Orthodox Christian believe in Macro-Evolution if it required death for 500 million years before the fall?

I am asking this because although I have been very disenchanted with Protestantism and seem to find that Orthodoxy makes sense, I am also a theistic evolutionist (former ardent young earth creationist), and could not bring myself to ever consider becoming Orthodox if I would have to close my eyes to evolutionary theory and just disregard all the evidence for it. My logic is that God has given us special revelation through the scriptures (and other things if Orthodoxy is true), but He has also given us the natural world to find Him. But if the natural world which God gave us is overwhelmingly telling me one story, and Orthodox Saints and Councils would tell me to believe another, I would have a hard time plugging my ears and closing my eyes and just ignoring what I think is obvious in God‚Äôs revelation of the natural world, that is the fossil record and Macro-Evolution.

I do believe in a historical Adam and Eve. I do not believe that Macro-Evolution was a blind process. I am aware from other pages asking questions like this, that most Orthodox seem to believe that there is no conflict between Orthodoxy and Macro-Evolution because Science is about the ‚Äúhow‚Äù and Christianity is about the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. That is why I limited my questions to the two listed above, in order to get some answers regarding specific instances when the Saints and Church Councils did seem to address the ‚Äúhow‚Äù, and how that could ever be reconciled with what I am overwhelmingly convinced is true from observations of the natural world. 

All responses are appreciated, thank you and God Bless. (And please don‚Äôt remove this post because I don‚Äôt know where else I could get answers to these questions lol)",OrthodoxChristianity

Abortion and the Covid 19 Vaccine: what should I do?,Lord_Have_Mercy123,1618001250,"I haven‚Äôt been making many posts recently because I mostly have my scrupulosity under control, but man is this giving me major anxiety.

I will start with what is obvious: (1) Murder is a terrible sin, (2) I am fiercely pro life and (3) abortion is morally justifiable UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES.

I am not saying that abortion is ok when I say this, but I really cannot think of any reason why the major Covid 19 vaccines available are morally or ethically problematic. All the research I have done seems to indicate the use a of a cell line derived from an abortion literally half a century ago. What happened to that PERSON was terrible, but shouldn‚Äôt we at least take the vaccine to minimize death and suffering *given we have no other option* and that this is comparable to *a medical student learning surgery on a murder victim*? A medical student who learns surgery on a murder victim isn‚Äôt committing murder and we aren‚Äôt sinning by proxy by allowing them to use their newfound medical knowledge on us or on others to save lives. We are using a tragic event to save lives. Of course, the desecration of the body is also sin, but that isn‚Äôt exactly on par with murder and I don‚Äôt see the ‚Äúplandemic‚Äù crowd saying we should also oppose the countless other activities that result in the desecration of corpses.

But the people saying the vaccine is the mark of the beast, everyone who gets it goes to hell, that any hiearchs supporting the use of the vaccine are ‚Äúatheists in vestments‚Äù and so on are causing my scupulosity to boil up and over again. What‚Äôs more, I might not even have a choice as to whether I get the vaccine since I still live with parents (I will be barely 18 by the time I‚Äôm vaccinated).

The Sinai Pantocrator Icon: Black tunic?,LuapOivasLamrin,1617976456,"This is related to my [other recent question](https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/mnh8tv/colour_of_clothing_of_the_mother_of_god_in_coptic/), because I have been reading about icons quite a bit in recent days.

I have read in several sources that in icons red represents divinity and blue humanity and so Christ is often shown in a red tunic and blue robes to show that he is God who has taken to Himself a human nature. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, in images of the Sinai Pantocrator icon (e.g., [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Pantocrator_(Sinai))) Christ seems to be dressed completely in black. Also, in several contemporary reproductions of the Pantocrator icon (e.g. [1](https://www.alexandraicons.gr/portfolio-item/christ-pantocrator-of-sinai-096/), [2](https://catalog.obitel-minsk.com/christ-the-pantocrator-imp-08015.html)) Christ is shown in black tunic and blue robe or in a purple-ish robe, though I did also find some contemporary reproductions of the Pantocrator icon where Christ is shown in red tunic and blue robe (E.g. [1](https://www.alexandraicons.gr/shop/christ-pantocrator-sku0050/), [2](https://skete.com/product/christ-pantocrator-patmos-j76/) ). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I was wondering if perhaps the original Sinai Pantocrator icon did depict Christ in a red tunic and blue robes, but the colours have faded over the centuries?",OrthodoxChristianity

Colour of clothing of the Mother of God in Coptic icons of the Nativity,LuapOivasLamrin,1617975053,"I have read in several places, including in some books in icons and in online articles like these ([1](https://russianicon.com/garments-meaning-orthodox-icons-mother-god/), [2](https://reinkat.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/red-mary-blue-mary/), [3](https://iconreader.wordpress.com/2010/07/07/icons-of-the-mother-of-god/)) that it is the norm for the Mother of God to be shown in a blue tunic and red outer robe.

However in several Coptic icons of the Nativity ([Here](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c6/4d/cd/c64dcd679bd691e0f5e44ba3c10c4d1a.jpg) is an example, but you can see others with the same colours by simply doing a Google Image search for terms like ""Coptic Nativity Icon"") the colour scheme seems to be reversed with the Mother of God depicted in red tunic and blue robe.

Giving to the homeless,Theobat,1617972811,"I copied and pasted this post from another sub because cross posting isn‚Äôt allowed here and I thought it has some valuable info, especially given that there was a question here not long ago discussing how to most effectively give to the homeless we encounter.  There are a lot of good ideas here that are small items we could keep with us, I even have a small collection of freebie sewing kits I‚Äôve saved over the years.  I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of giving them to the homeless.  Thanks to this post I would like to try keeping a pack of socks in the car to share with the folks I sometimes encounter at stop lights.  It seems easy and inexpensive.  But there are lots of options below for you to consider.  Have a lovely day.


‚ÄúYSK that i work with those experiencing home insecurity/homelessness and we curated a list of affordable products that double as invaluable donations

why ysk: hey, mental health counselor and social worker here! my city is especially struggling with destabilized housing and shelter. people start to become unsure about the needs of this demographic and will ask me ""what should i donate? toys? blankets? seasonal items?""

the long answer, yes. of course. but if you are asking for a list of items that you are certain will be 1. equitable, 2. convenient and 3. accessible then here is a list of items that have been approved by both those working as community aid and those who are part of the destabilized community itself:

\- socks. socks are SO important. the quickest infections can happen at the feet when people are elderly, mentally ill, in active addiction, unable to control dry conditions. it is really convenient if you wrap them in pairs, flat, in baggies. these baggies can be used again, and it keeps their next pair clean and dry and portable. i will buy mens (10ish usually) because they size down for womens shoes and they size up with a stretch for larger sizes. i don't recommend investing too much into these because socks in homelessness last only a few days (ideally). also: crew socks, not ankle socks.

\- pet food. a lot of these folks, more than you'd ever think to consider, have a pet sidekick that is their family. i have been told ""i can eat pizza crust out of the garbage can, but my buddy deserves better."" small cans of wet pet food are very much welcomed in the community. there is also the reality that some people would prefer to fill their bag with pet food and eat it themselves if it means their animal is nourished - and companionship is never shunned in this community, so please be inclusive to these precious friends. no one loves a homeless dog quite like a person who is homeless.

\- collapsible bowls. good for washing face, brushing teeth, eating food, etc. and they can be used for pets as well. collapsible bowls are marketed for a variety of things - i usually buy mine online in packs of varying sizes for food storage, and then i split them into individual gifting. ""we eat a lot of packs of food, and nothing will make you crazier than food without a bowl. i wouldn't trade my bowl for anything. i can't believe i made it so long without a bowl.""

\- first aid kids, or first aid materials, particularly gauze wraps and hydrogen peroxide or some sort of hand/wound sanitizer. bandaids don't tend to do much with the conditions and then elements. stretchy bandage wraps are pretty universal, can be used without scissors, and are resilient. i DO NOT recommend rubbing alcohol or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. this is dangerous to consume but is very often consumed when a person is alcohol dependent.

\- sewing kits and shoelaces. a lot of people don't consider this, but their clothes and shoes get a lot more wear than is normally expected. it is much easier to sew a button back on than expect a whole item of clothing to get replaced. shoelaces break a lot, and they can be used for other things (hair ties, folding tents, etc.). i have been told that mending clothes with sewing is therapeutic, ""because the jacket wasn't wanted but with a little care, it can be needed - like me.""

\- tampons/pads. remember that feminine hygiene products are necessary but not free.

\- coconut oil - note, i WILL buy this in bigger containers because the cost different is HUGE. less waste, i can distribute more, and i have leftover cash to buy reusable flat jars and some printer labels to distinguish a new seal. this can be used as chapstick, moisturizer, and also hair grease. natural hair gets especially neglected in homelessness and hair grease is a sought-after product. bonus: it's food-grade for cooking as well.

\- antibacterial wet wipes (not just baby wipes). they can be used to wash hands, they can be used to wash the body, and they are sanitizing vs. just cleansing. i wish there was something i could suggest that was better for the environment but this is the most effective, sanitary, portable and convenient option for most that eliminates ethanol alcohol.

\- deodorant. i usually just provide something like speedstick or whatever is at the dollar store. honestly i feel like the process of putting on deodorant is more emotionally valuable than a preference for feminine scents or it being antiperspirant. it's a ritual of self care. stick deodorant is the most preferred because it lasts a long time and it's familiar.

\- a mirror and a comb i have also been told that having access to these two things provides a better sense of self worth because ""i can watch me take care of myself, and that reminds me that i'm worth more than i think i am."" i buy small compact mirrors and pick combs (can be used on all hair types, including natural hair types that otherwise don't handle small combs).

\- baking soda toothpaste and a toothbrush. i will usually tie these two things together with a hair tie, which i always pack too. if they need it, they have a hair tie. if not, it can keep their two products together. these are preferred to be full size because it doesn't make a difference and one of my clients said ""the small toothbrushes just make me feel small too."" baking soda tried and true.

\- peanut butter. PEANUT BUTTER. so high in fat, so high in protein, you can get this sugar free and no one cares and it's more accessible. it lasts forever, it's a great snack, it's quick. ""it really helps me with anxiety when i start wondering when i'll eat again."" yes, some people are allergic. this helps a jazillion more people than it could ever harm in this community.

\- reusable bottles that have a good seal and can hook. these don't have to be expensive, they sell them at the dollar store and walmart etc. but the more the merrier because you can fill them when you see a source and just hook them outside your bag - no space requirement. i discourage single-use bottles of water and feel this is a more sustainable and practical alternative. try to be mindful of how hard it could be to clean (straw, nozzle) because perishable liquids are often kept in these and mold/bacteria can be a factor in these bottles. don't get tempted by the fancy spouts.

\- powdered hydrators or sports drinks. ""these are a life saver. i don't have to carry bottles of sports drinks and i get excited to try new flavors and kinds.""

\- condoms. seriously. just because there isn't a bedroom does't mean they aren't sexually active, because they are people too! encourage safety, not shame.

\- trident/dental gum. a lot of dental problems are from dry mouth/gum disease. antipsychotics are infamous for causing dry-mouth, and stimulants especially can dry the mouth by reducing thirst. dental gum is great to freshen breath, keep the mouth hygienic, and i was told that it can help mentally: ""time doesn't mean anything when you're going nowhere and wearing the same clothes. chewing gum reminds me of being a kid and it makes me feel normal again.""",OrthodoxChristianity

The elder monk came to prostitute and said, here, take this coin, soon a young man will come after me, do what i tell you and refuse him. The prostitute agreed. When the elder came out of brothel, he told the young monk - now you go. The young monk came before the prostitute, and before anything happened, the prostitute said - wait, there are rules even here. We must both do 50 prostrations, and then we may proceed. Both the young monk and the prostitute started prostrating, when they reached about 20 or 30, the young monk said - I cannot worship before the sin. And the young monk rushed out. The two monks returned to their monastery, and God had removed the lust from the young monk. Do the prostrations before the sin, and the demons shall flee.    (Source Unknown)",OrthodoxChristianity

Is there such a thing as a mortal sin in Orthodoxy? How does confession work?,osteo5511,1617902902,"I am a Catholic and enjoy Orthodox music, artwork, and liturgy. 

I am wondering if there is such a thing as a mortal sin in Orthodoxy. In Catholicism, a mortal sin will send you straight to Hell if you die with it being unconfessed. It essentially cuts you off from God.

You are also unable to take the Eucharist because this would be considered sacrilege. The logic is, you would be taking the Eucharist unworthily because you have an unconfessed mortal sin on your soul. This is backed up by scripture, specifically Corinthians.

[SUPPORT] People of Mount Athos - Documentary Film Trailer (Andrei Oprescu),YioUio,1617888150,"Trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hku4ULuOatc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hku4ULuOatc)

  
Filmmaker Andrei Oprescu ‚Äúhas spent an extensive amount of time living together with the monks \[of Mt. Athos\], gaining their trust in order to be able to reveal a perspective that was never captured on camera before.‚Äù

The fruit of his labor is the documentary, ‚ÄúPeople of Mt. Athos,‚Äù for which he has already shot more than 100 hours of footage.

The trailer for the documentary was released on March 11:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hku4ULuOatc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hku4ULuOatc)

Oprescu writes on the [official film website](https://www.andreioprescu.com/mount-athos-documentary) that he began making it with his own budget, but is now in need of financial assistance to continue filming and complete the documentary. He is the head of an award-winning [video production company in London](https://www.andreioprescu.com/mount-athos-documentary) that has worked with a wide range of companies over the past 10 years.

The filmmaker writes about Mt. Athos:

Mount Athos is perhaps one of the most fascinating places on Earth yet little is known about it and the monastic community living there.

Some could arguably say Mount Athos is a living museum, filled with medieval fortress-like churches, artefacts and fully inhabited by a men-only society who lives by ancient traditions. Never being a place of interest for the mass tourism and barely ever having any attention in the press, does not come as a surprise. The truth be told this was well premeditated for centuries. It is this secrecy that helped Mount Athos preserve a micro society that lives by medieval rules to this day.

Having all ties with the outside world cut for centuries made the unstoppable marching of time have a different tempo in Athos. From the large stone walls of the buildings, the way the inhabitants dress, speak, work and act, even the food recipes and the means of transportation are something that a modern person will consider of the past.

Today, and it has always been this way, Mount Athos is inhabited by a community of monks living by the strictest rules of Orthodox Christianity. For them everything they do seems utterly normal. For someone from the outside, it is a completely fascinating world, different in so many ways to what we perceive as normal. However, few were those who have witnessed these wonders.

A few incursions have been made during the last few decades, however those were superficial. Some of the most fundamental principles of a monk are to run away from the outside world, to live in obscurity. Therefore any attempt at making a documentary in Mount Athos has been in a direct conflict with those principles. A lot is known about the history of the place but very little about the monks themselves and their way of life.

Finding faith after my daughter's death,heresyoursigns,1617886885,"Hello everyone. In my history you will find my reasons for joining reddit and looking for solace after my baby passed away this Winter. My husband is Orthodox, my children have been baptized as Orthodox, and while I always admired the Church I never felt any faith in God or had belief in my heart. When she died in my hands I saw it as a sign of my complete and utter loneliness, of the absurd and malicious universe we are trapped in. Since then, I have had many conversations that have changed my perspective. When she died I thought she was in agony and looked like she was being crucified. I've since learned that she was likely having seizure-like episodes that looked far more horrific than they likely felt to her. I wonder now if my daughter was a different sort of sign, if there was mercy when I saw none, if I've been called to have faith.

I was in a discussion with someone about the difference between ""magic"" and Divine action, and part of the distinction I made between the two is that ""magic"" implies composition whereas Divine action is not composite. But then I wondered if this would match the Orthodox understanding of God. 

I mean obviously no Orthodox would ever say that God uses magic (that would be blasphemous), but would it be correct to say that God is not composite? I admit that I don't know very much about the distinction between Divine essence and energies, but I wasn't sure if the distinction is meant to imply that there is some composition. Like, God is made up of both essence and energies and those form the composite elements of God. I don't think that's the case, but I don't want to misrepresent the Orthodox teaching.

Questions from a potential convert from Germany,Max2340,1617840802,"Helly everyone!

I'm technically a catholic but I didn't go to confirmation yet because I wanna be absolutely sure I will stay in the church I swear an oath to. I live in Germany but I have a local russian orthodox church here. I do prefer the catholic mass here because I love the church organ and the gregorian music of your local cathedral, but I won't choose my religion based merely on aesthetics. So don't worry, I won't choose my church based on prefered aesthetic. I think it's pretty fair to say the Schism was a issue of both sides and is something in need of mending, but it has become quite clear to me that the Catholic churches teaching of papal infallibility makes less and less sense the more I look at it. 

1. Did the Orthodox church ever struggle with changes in Dogma ( like the death penalty for romans ) like Catholics do? The roman catholics had several heretical popes now, but what exactly does protect the orthodox teaching from being corrupted from heretical bishops or patriarchs? What for example, will happen if all current patriarchs are heretical? Do you simply say this won't happen because the holy spirit protects them?
2. As a German the only church of orthodoxy available to me is a small russian orthodox church, of course it's hard for me to go there because it will always feel quite foreign to me, the latin church feels much more closer to my national Tradition but sadly I don't got any western rite orthodox near me. Is it okay if I continue to pray in catholic churches outside of masses and lit candles to the marian altars there? 
3. The papacy claims that the pope can make infallible statements when speaking ex cathedra. Don't the orthodox claim something very similar by saying councils made up of several patriarchs can make infallible decisions? So isn't it essentially the same teaching split up onto several ""popes"" instead of one singular head? If so, wouldn't the same potential errors that plague rome apply to orthodoxy?

Sexual abuse and Confession,bonitabandita,1617811039,"I'm a catechumen at my local Orthodox Church, and my priest explained Confession to me and told me to write down things I feel I need to confess and talk with him about it before I go to Confession.

As I was writing stuff down, I know one of the main things I want to confess is my bad masturbation habit that I struggle with. I then got reminded of sexual abuse that occurred in my childhood for a few years by a parent. I obviously will not talk about others or their sins during my Confession, but I was wondered if I should include this in my Confession as simply ‚Äúfornication‚Äù that occurred?¬†

I don‚Äôt think it belongs in Confession as it was nonconsensual, but I don‚Äôt want to accidentally omit something important either.

i think I almost lost my faith because....,MentalityWarrior,1617704167,"I have many doubts about Christianity and maybe about religions generally.

There are some things in CHristianity that I cant understand.

But when it comes to faith, isn't a little like gambling? Isn't it natural for some people not to believe without evidence? I think I have a friend who probably lost his faith.

The more I learn about my faith the more anxious I feel (long wall of text warning),Bronkth,1617679464,"Sorry for the long wall of text!

Hi all, so I was baptized in the Eastern Orthodox Church and definitely observed a lot of practices but I never really examined my faith. I was always fearful of God but it's becoming all-consuming for me now.  After confessing several weeks ago and admitting that I'm a lukewarm Christian who doesn't know that much about their faith, the priest advised me to learn more about Orthodoxy, so I am trying to now.  Connecting with God makes me happy, but when I get into details about what's allowed and what's not and what is really The Church, I feel really scared. It feels like the prevailing teaching is that everything outside of The Church--meaning the Orthodox Church- is not sound and almost like it doesn't count as following Jesus? it made me think of my friends who are devout Christians of different denominations, such as Catholicism and how knowledgeable and good and devout they are, and I would consider them ""better"" (though I know it's not a competition) Christians than myself. And thinking that their devotion doesn't count because they're not Orthodox makes me sad. 

  I also  want to connect with fellow christians to talk about theology and life but I'm scared to get 'bad' advice on the teachings because if it comes from non-orthodox christians then it might not be sound and I don't know if I should follow it. Should I not talk to non-orthodox christians about faith if I'm a beginner who can't decipher what's orthodox?

I feel like an idiot for commiting the same sins that I repented for and a little hopeless. If I repent I shouldn't do it anymore. But we are also taught (I think??) that we as humans are prone to commiting sin. So what do you do? Is the goal to reach being sinless, but is that even possible? Does my confession and repentance not count if I messed up again? Will there be a point where God gives up on me?

I'm also confused about why our sins count against us and that we should repent if Jesus died for our sins? I know sin is bad and absolutely feel guilt and remorse but I'm trying to understand our faith better. Do we get saved through faith or, good works and faith? Did Jesus die to cleanse us of original sin or all sin that we commit?

If I don't have a sudden change of heart does that mean I'm doing something wrong? I am slowly moving towards not justifying my transgressions but I see youtube videos where some people do a complete 180 and I wonder if I should be like them, or if everyone has their time.

However, I found it to be an odd singularity that pretty much only the abrahamic religions adhere to the opinion that they are the only way to be saved.

Revalations says will be able to buy or sell without the mark of the beast. With the vaccine slowly starting to become mandatory to work, travel, etc. once its made available to the vast majority of the public, what if it really does become a requirement for trade? 

Regardless of whether or not the vaccine is the mark of the beast, there is no question in my mind that this world is not being ruled by people who have our best interests in mind.

Which Easter Day is more correct?

Questions from an inquirer,Handelaerus,1617576255,"Greetings, I am a Protestant who currently tends towards Orthodox Christianity and I have a few questions about it.  


Well first of all I currently want to convert to Orthodox Christianity, I live in Dordrecht, the Netherlands. A city that has no Orthodox churches at all, unfortunately. What should I do? Well there are some churches in nearby cities but I am not a very rich person and I do not always have the possibility to travel.   


My next question is why there is so much symbolism in Orthodox churches, the decorations. Because I think this is not what Jesus stands for, I could be wrong ofcourse but I am just wondering.

History of Icons in Christianity,Jattack33,1617563514,"I came across [this](https://twitter.com/PatristicsFan/status/1374808641279307778?s=20) twitter thread earlier where it is stated that early Christianity was Aniconic, opposed to religious imagery. The Protestant historian Phillip Schaaf said on the matter 

&gt;Yet previous to the time of Constantine we find no trace of an image of Christ properly speaking except among the Gnostic Carpocratians and in the case of the heathen emperor Alexander Severus who adorned his domestic chapel as a sort of pantheistic Pantheon with representatives of all religions. The above mentioned idea of the uncomely personal appearance of Jesus the entire silence of the Gospels about it and the Old Testament prohibition of images restrained the church from making either pictures or statues of Christ until the Nicene age when a great reaction in this respect took place though not without energetic and long continued opposition. 

And it seems this does seemingly fit quite well with Patristic quotes and decisions of Councils. The non-ecumenical 305AD Synod of Elvira said

&gt;Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration 

Eusebius of Caesarea wrote

&gt;To depict purely the human form of Christ before its transformation, on the other hand, is to break the commandment of God and to fall into pagan error

What are we to think of the repeating miracle of the Holy Fire?,Pilgrim_of_Antioch,1617508979,"I have read earlier today, over on r/catholicism, that the miracle of the Holy Fire today is a fraud.  A user claimed that the miracle was authentic and accepted universally as such but at one point it ceased when it was sacked by the muslims?  They claimed that the miracle has never returned and cited Orthodox Patriarchs throughout history who have made claims to support that view.  Now I am very new to Orthodoxy and am still learning the ins and outs, and I understand individual opinions of clergy, even Patriarchs, do not carry the same weight as say, a Roman Catholic Pope to his flock, or perhaps even a protestant pastor to his/her flock.  So that leaves me with the question, what ""are"" we to think of it?  

I found no reason to deny it, as I've seen videos of the fire not burning papers/books/beards (in true Orthodox fashion), etc.  But someone was claiming that that can be imitated by using a certain chemical (something phosphorus if I remembered what I read clearly) that has a delayed self ignition that could be used to replicate the miracle, and that while these chemicals were active, they wouldn't burn hot enough to burn anything for a time.  

I'm not shaken by the claims of the Catholic or even the scientific theory to imitate the miracle, as I find I can dismiss those easily enough.

The quality quantity and diversity of the icons is incredible. There were Ethiopian icons, Byzantine icons, an early iconostasis from Constantinople, Russian icons, a giant copy ( from the 16th century ) of St Rublevs holy trinity.

How to answer this objection to Christianity,Stove-Jebs,1617393406,"I saw this online today and don‚Äôt really know how to answer it. What is your take on it?

‚ÄúThe Paradoxically Murdered God

The crucifixion and death of Jesus are fraught with theological problems for Christianity. According to orthodox theology, Jesus is God and man as one person, not one being containing both a God person and a human person. But when we read the Gospels and other scriptures, we are faced with so many questions.

How can a God who is supposedly impassible suffer? When Jesus died, did God die too? If only the man Jesus suffered and died, then we have the heresy of Docetism. If we say Jesus suffered and died as the full Godman, then God suffered and died too.

Jesus asks ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"" How can one who is God be forsaken by God in any sense?

Jesus is said to have descended to hell. If only the soul of the man Jesus descended into hell, but not God, then we have again split the nature of Jesus into three parts: body, soul, and Son, which is an odd sort of Nestorian heresy at best.

Great theologians have struggled with this for centuries, but from where I stand, the easier answer is that later theologians crafted intricate doctrine, but trying to read it into the Bible only creates questions and paradoxes. This reveals that our Christian orthodoxy is a purely human creation, not present in the early texts or Christianity at all and not a divine revelation or truth.‚Äù",OrthodoxChristianity

Help me with 40 day memorial maths,velvetneenrabbit,1617348664,"Note: I'm in Australia and Greek Orthodox

I'm planning my dads 40 day memorial with everything happening quite suddenly. I'm consulting with the parish but I have inquisitive relatives who are confusing me. 

Is the 40 days counted from the death or from the funeral? The parish asked for date of funeral and given the 40 days falls in holy week they said the earliest date prior to Easter would be 18 April (24 days after funeral) or after Easter on 18 May (55 odd days after funeral and currently booked).

Family are saying under no circumstance can the memorial occur after the 40 days. Is this right? I'll be calling the church back to reconfirm the counting and the dates but given that's the date they suggested my thinking is that it's OK seeing as Easter is in the middle.

Analysis Of Sister Taylor Of West Reading's Talk On Dialogues Between The Roman Catholic And Eastern Orthodox Churches,axe_enthusiast,1617336164,"&gt;I remember when we broke up the first time  

This seemingly refers to the well known schism of 1054, which acts as a good date for the schism between the Eastern and Western churches, but really isn't the final say on the then developing schism.  


&gt;Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,""  
This seems to capture the initial energy of the early stages of the schism, were delegates of the pope seemingly worked outside of their orders out of some intense feelings of dissatisfaction with the Eastern Church and feeling that they had simply seen enough.  

&gt;'cause like
&gt;We hadn't seen each other in a month
&gt;When you said you needed space. (What?)  

This seemingly refers to later reunion dialogues that more so than anything established that there would be a permanent schism as had already been established de facto, but because of ongoing confusing developments hadn't been established more than temporarily de jure. This is as opposed to just a temporary one as had happened many times in the early Church, but were mended over time.  

&gt;Then you come around again and say
&gt;""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me.""  &gt;Remember how that lasted for a day?

This could refer to recent activities by popes more open to ecumenical dialogue who have worked with the Orthodox Church to establish common ground, but then gone on to do the same with other churches in such a way as to bring to question how serious they were being, along with how they haven't changed their practices to fit what they say, for instance allowing for there to be Eastern Catholics, but not doing anything to fix the ongoing problems of the order of the administration of sacraments in the Roman Catholic Church and their not communing their children.  

&gt;I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you.""  

This captures how sometimes the Orthodox Church, though right in it's theology and truly successors to the apostles, acts rashly in regards to the Roman Catholic Church, while they on the other hand struggle with meaningless statements that seem to give rise to good will , but without the end result of any actual progress.  

&gt;Ooh, we called it off again last night
&gt;But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
&gt;We are never ever ever getting back together x2  

This addresses the many attempts at reunion and how they have all been fruitless, to the point of there being no point in attempting to build up to reunion as at this point it simply will never happen, a notion so powerful that it is repeated.  

&gt;You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
&gt;But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
&gt;Like, ever...  

This probably refers to the Roman Catholic Churches attempts, in a way successful to sign many common declarations of faith with various other Christian churches. They can and do talk to their friends, the Protestants that came from them, and our friends, the Oriental Orthodox and Church of the East, and to us, but despite this we still will never be getting back together.  

&gt;I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
&gt;And me falling for it screaming that I'm right  

This could be in reference to the political pressure put on Orthodox Churches who in response to this ended up reuniting with Rome. Though even these Eastern Catholics stated beliefs seemingly uphold the Orthodox Churches position, causing us to want to scream about how right we are. As annoying as these false unions are it's almost detrimental for our case for them to stop as they only show all the more the invalidity of the Roman Catholic position.

&gt;And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
&gt;With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

This possibly refers to how the Roman Catholic Church seems to go back and forth between flirting with the traditional Christian churches and flirting with liberal Christians and those of other religions, doing whichever benefits them more at the moment depending on what they are taking more heat for.  

Some previous statements are then restated to drive home the importance of earlier observations.  

&gt;I used to think that we were forever ever
&gt;And I used to say, ""Never say never..."" 

This likely refers to how the early Christian Fathers placed great trust in Rome and made many statements that commended thier seeming unwavering Orthodoxy, little did they know that these quotes would later be misused to arguing for heresies they themselves would have argued against.  

&gt;Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you,""
&gt;And I'm like... ""I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
&gt;We are never getting back together. Like, ever""
&gt;No!
This conclussion of sort captures the moment many of us have had when we finally realize that there never will be a reunion between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. Though many of us have ourselves at one point argued for the utility or likelihood of this reunion we eventually realize after enough study that there is simply too much built up against this reunion and we need to acknowledge that it simply will never happen.

Again she restates some of her earlier statements, this time following her final statement of complete exhaustion with ongoing dialogues, driving home the perpetual inevitability of any attempt at reunion between the Eastern and Western Churches not being fruitful.",OrthodoxChristianity
Need help in responding to a traditional Catholic's attacks against Orthodoxy. Argument copy/pasted below.,OrthodoxInTraining,1617331723,"We traditional Catholics should never be swerved by anti-Papal polemicists. They do great harm to the Rock on which Christ Jesus built His Holy Church.  


The Council of Chalcedon is the best refutation of all anti-Papal schismatics. True it is that many are ignorant of the Papacy in good faith, however, obstinate attackers of the Papacy can hardly be presumed to be in invincible ignorance anymore. Their ignorance becomes culpable the more they are aware. Attacking the Papacy is a sin against God.  


From: [http://www.biblicalcatholic.com/apologetics/a35.htm](http://www.biblicalcatholic.com/apologetics/a35.htm)  


Similarly, the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, speak of Leo, saying...  


&gt;**Quote:**""**Wherefore the most holy and blessed Leo, archbishop of the great and elder Rome, through us, and through this present most holy synod together with the thrice-blessed and all-glorious Peter the Apostle, who is the Rock and foundation of the Catholic Church, and the foundation of the orthodox faith**, hath stripped him (Dioscorus, Bishop of Alexandria) of his episcopate, and hath alienated from him all hieratic worthiness."" -- Acts of Chalcedon, Session 3

In the same way, upon concluding their synod, the Council fathers write to Pope Leo, saying...  


&gt;**Quote:You are set as an interpreter to all of the voice of blessed Peter**, and to all you impart the blessings of that Faith. -- Chalcedon to Pope Leo, Ep 98  
For if where two or three are gathered together in His name He has said that there He is in the midst of them, must He not have been much more particularly present with 520 priests, who preferred the spread of knowledge concerning Him ...**Of whom you were Chief, as Head to the members**, showing your good will. -- Chalcedon to Pope Leo (Repletum est Gaudio), November 451  
Besides all this, he (Dioscorus) extended his fury even against him¬†**who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the Savior. We refer to Your Holiness**. -- Chalcedon to Pope Leo, Ep 98  
You have often extended your Apostolic radiance even to the Church of Constantinople. -- Chalcedon to Pope Leo, Ep 98  
Knowing that every success of the children rebounds to the parents, we therefore beg you to honor our decision by your assent,¬†**and as we have yielded agreement to the Head in noble things, so may the Head also fulfill what is fitting for the children**. -- Chalcedon to Pope Leo, Ep 98

So, the Council of Chalcedon clearly recognized Pope Leo¬†**as the successor of Peter and the Head of the Church**. However, the Council did have one problem. One of its canons, Canon 28, had given Constantinople primacy in the East. The Canon read:  


&gt;**Quote:**""...we do also enact and decree the same things concerning the privileges of the most holy Church of Constantinople, which is New Rome. For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of old Rome, because it was the royal city. And the one hundred fifty most religious Bishops gave equal privileges to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city is honored with the Sovereignty and the Senate and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome...."" (Canon 28, Chalcedon)

However, Pope Leo refused to agree to this canon; and employing a kind of ""line item veto,"" ordered it struck from the Council documents. In this, Bishop Anatolius of Constantinople writes to Pope Leo, apologizing and explaining how the canon came to be, saying ...  


&gt;**Quote:**As for those things which the universal Council of Chalcedon recently ordained in favor of the church of Constantinople, let Your Holiness be sure that there was no fault in me, who from my youth have always loved peace and quiet, keeping myself in humility. It was the most reverend clergy of the church of Constantinople who were eager about it, and they were equally supported by the most reverend priests of those parts, who agreed about it. Even so, the whole force of confirmation of the acts was reserved for the authority of Your Blessedness. Therefore, let Your Holiness know for certain that I did nothing to further the matter, knowing always that I held myself bound to avoid the lusts of pride and covetousness. -- Patriarch Anatolius of Constantinople to Pope Leo, Ep 132 (on the subject of canon 28 of Chalcedon).

So, the matter was settled; and, for the next 6 centuries, all Eastern churches speak of only 27 canons of Chalcedon -- the 28th Canon being rendered null and void by Rome's ""line item veto."" This is supported by all the Greek historians, such as Theodore the Lector (writing in 551 AD), John Skolastikas (writing in 550 AD), Dionysius Exegius (also around 550 AD); and by Roman Popes like Pope St. Gelasius (c. 495) and Pope Symmachus (c. 500) -- all of whom speak of only 27 Canons of Chalcedon.""",OrthodoxChristianity
Question concerning the Jesus Prayer and Visualization as presented in The Way of a Pilgrim,BazDim2,1617326828,"Hello all,

First I‚Äôd like to say a quick thank you and God bless to everyone who responded so kindly to my post the other day, and offered me heartfelt and genuine compassion and sympathy. Truly heartwarming.

Okay so- I first read The Way of a Pilgrim some years ago, and haven‚Äôt read it since. I‚Äôve recently found myself recommending it to a few friends, and thought ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm recommending it so much, I really ought to give it a second read through‚Äù.

First, it really is such a wonderful book - such simple beauty. If you haven‚Äôt read it already, I can‚Äôt recommend it enough; if the desire to pray unceasingly can be called a *burning desire*, then this book is truly kindling.

However, I encountered towards the end spent if that struck me as something of a contradiction, one that I had not previously identified or recalled.

Spoilers ahead:

In the Fourth Narrative, the pilgrim is instructed his blind companion on how to achieve prayer of the heart. He instructs him to ‚Äúvisualize your heart with your mind. Focus your eyes as if you were looking at it, right through the wall of your chest cavity. Try to visualize it as vividly as possible...‚Äù

However, I had always read that the Jesus Prayer should be utterly apophatic and devoid of visualizations, and indeed even in the very next page the pilgrim advices ‚ÄúHowever, as you do all this, guard against mental imaginings and any sort of visions. Reject everything your imagination produces, for the holy Fathers strictly teach that interior prayer must be a visionless exercise, lest one fall into delusion‚Äù.

So, how do we reconcile the advice to visualize the heart with the advice to avoid visualizations?

In anticipation of being told to ‚Äúask your priest‚Äù, I fully intend to, but I was curious if anyone had any insight beforehand.

Thank you and God bless",OrthodoxChristianity

"Attacked by an Atheist (former) friend of mine. (Very long, tl;dr at end)",Olav_The_Destroyer,1617285484,"This happened on Facebook a few days ago. I posted something pretty harmless, which was just a picture of Jimmy Carter saying something about how his faith enjoins him to help as many people as he can while he has time. Something like that. But this post is not about Jimmy Carter.

What happened then was something I actually did not expect: a Facebook friend of mine, who I had visited in Denmark ten years ago when I was in Europe, started going off about how altruism is antithetical to Abrahamic religion. He claimed that good deeds, for their own sake, were invented by the secular humanists. I told him to read his Bible if he truly believed that. He asserted that he already had read it, multiple times, and took college classes about religion, and his dad was a vicar, and ‚Äúcomparative theology was the usual dinner table discussion.‚Äù This guy was a prime candidate for r/iamverysmart. He always has been, but we never talked about religion.

The claims he was making definitely made it seem like he hadn‚Äôt read the gospels. He asserted that Jesus never told us to do good deeds (‚ÄúLet your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father in heaven‚Äù) or the be altruistic (‚ÄúLove one another as I have loved you‚Äù). There‚Äôs so much there, in all of the gospels and in the Johannine epistles about loving your brothers, and there‚Äôs plenty in the book of James about the necessity of good works (which, being Danish, his homeboy, Martin Luther, despised because it refuted his idea about salvation through faith alone). I told him all this. I usually don‚Äôt argue with people, but since he was a friend, I decided to take him up on the discussion.  
 

But it soon became clear he was not participating in good faith. When I cited the Bible, he said the Bible is just a translation of a translation of a translation of a translation, therefore nothing in it was at all like the original and it wasn‚Äôt reliable. I am aware of the perils of translation, having been a language major in college, but what you end up with is not so different from the original that it would totally invalidate the target text. He also said there was no evidence that anything that happened in the Bible actually happened. It‚Äôs all lies.  
 

Just wait, it gets better. He said, ‚ÄúJesus said any sin can be forgiven if you believe, but if you don‚Äôt believe, you‚Äôre in for eternal damnation, and no amount of good deeds can change that. That‚Äôs literally what the gospel says.‚Äù He said Jesus had said that. Jesus did say that by believing, we would have access to eternal life, but I think this guy‚Äôs eternal eternal damnation idea is based on nothing much. Yes, Romans 8-11 but that was Paul, not Jesus, and it is very easy to misinterpret. Jesus talks about Gehenna and the outer darkness and hades, but in all of those cases he seems to be telling parables about people who are not nice to the poor and who are hypocrites. Which is dependent on their actions. Not predestination. I told him many Christians would disagree with the idea of double predestination, and we shouldn‚Äôt all be painted with the same brush (he said he had been attacked by a fundamentalist online who told him he was damned for not believing, an assertion I never made or would make). I told him about Orthodoxy (I‚Äôve been Orthodox for 4 years) and how I use it as the standard against which all other Christian theologies must be measured. He wasn‚Äôt having any of it. He thinks even Orthodoxy is lies because it was made up thousands of years ago just for the sake of controlling people through fear. I find this to be a standard assertion by many Atheists. Everything that‚Äôs wrong with the world was caused by the Church. We need to ‚Äúliberate‚Äù ourselves by allowing all of our passions to completely enslave us, and being servile to our worldly desires (sex, money, food, attention).

Then, he said he had never heard a convincing argument for why there should be a God, and asked to hear mine. And at that point, I said, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre asking me to convince you there‚Äôs a God, I can‚Äôt. Sounds like you‚Äôve already got your mind made up. God does not force anyone to believe. You‚Äôve got your free will.‚Äù

He proceeded to send me a couple of pretty sarcastic gifs, so I blocked him. Him and his wife. It became clear he was not interested in discussion or learning; he already knew everything, he was just picking an argument with me because he had an axe to grind and he thought he could win. It was unfortunate, because when I visited him and his wife they were very kind to me. But I guess that kindness was conditional on believing what he believes. He seems a lot like the kind of Christian he hates.

I didn‚Äôt even mention how if his church was Lutheran, he was learning some wrong things at church as a kid. I didn‚Äôt tell him how unless his college was a seminary, he was learning about God from a secular viewpoint that was very skewed, and his professors were probably greatly opposed to God and the Church, that is, if his professors were anything like mine when I was in school. They would find every opportunity to talk about how much they hated God, even though it was not a religion class. It seems, many Atheists want you to know exactly how angry they are, exactly how much of an axe they have to grind, and how you‚Äôre a stupid sillyhead if you believe in anything beyond what‚Äôs right in front of you.

There was a time, when I was in high school in college, when I was very much in the world, where I was pretty much a nonbeliever. I could never go full Atheist, because at the end of the day I found it pretty presumptuous to be able to say with certainty either there is or there isn‚Äôt a God. My idea was, I don‚Äôt know. Now I believe, I have more knowledge, and I think there is much good that can come from religion. I don‚Äôt see it as a moral cudgel to beat people over the head with, I see it as a living relationship between me, others, and my higher power, the Holy Trinity.  I see it as a path to repentance and reconciliation.

I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised. Jesus met opposition. The apostles met opposition. There‚Äôs plenty in the epistles about meeting opposition for your faith. I was reading *The Ladder of Divine Ascent* this morning, and steps 1 and 2 mention that kind of opposition. So clearly this is nothing new. But I just felt it was so unwarranted. I‚Äôve never said a thing to him about religion since my conversion. He just fully went on the attack for no reason, and I hadn‚Äôt even said anything that would offend modern secular sensibilities, such as that I‚Äôm against polyamory. It was all about him and his need to be right, but not even having his facts straight about the religion he seeks to discredit.

This morning, reading step 2 of *The Ladder*, in talking about detachment, John Climacus cites Jesus saying, ‚ÄúLet the dead bury their own dead.‚Äù This morning, that really resonated with me. This guy, I wish him well, I pray that he will find whatever it is he‚Äôs looking for, and that he will get whatever he needs, and that his family will prosper. At the same time, I will no longer be in contact with him, and he may continue worshiping his own intellect over the One who created him.

My question for Atheists would be this: you often attack unprovoked.  If you're attacking, you're feeling threatened.  And if all this religion stuff is supposedly not true, why are you so afraid of it?

Ever Virgin,IrinaSophia,1617218564,"Beliefs about Mary are some of the most controversial among Christian denominations. For those who adhere to Solo Scriptura, Orthodox beliefs are problematic to say the least. The main argument is that they're not in the Bible, and for the most part they're right. Or as one person told me, ""What an absolute load of nonBiblical rubbish.""
The beliefs that are the most troublesome for others are: 

When Mary became impure she had to leave the temple, but had no one to take her in. Joseph is referred to as ""the betrothed"" which means they didn't have the actual wedding, although betrothal was sufficient. (Okay, I'm unclear on the betrothal thing). 

Joseph was an much older man who had been widowed and had children of his own. 

Mary and Joseph never had children and never had sex. 

Mary was always a virgin, even after the birth of Christ.

Every day the death toll number scrolls along the bottom of the screen, and every day I say a little prayer to myself for the repose of their souls, and every day my prayers seem increasingly... small? How many deaths and shattered families there must be by now. How can my little silent prayer matter in the face of such loss.

I normally am able to contain this a little better and exercise some measure of emotional control and *apatheia*, but I guess I‚Äôm just feeling a little overwhelmed today.

Is St. John of Damascus‚Äô ‚ÄúProof that there is a God‚Äù an early variation of the contingency argument?,Lord_Have_Mercy123,1617209757,"&gt; All things, that exist, are either created or uncreated. If, then, things are created, it follows that they are also wholly mutable. For things, whose existence originated in change, must also be subject to change, whether it be that they perish or that they become other than they are by act of will. But if things are uncreated they must in all consistency be also wholly immutable. For things which are opposed in the nature of their existence must also be opposed in the mode of their existence, that is to say, must have opposite properties: who, then, will refuse to grant that all existing things, not only such as come within the province of the senses, but even the very angels, are subject to change and transformation and movement of various kinds? For the things appertaining to the rational world, I mean angels and spirits and demons, are subject to changes of will, whether it is a progression or a retrogression in goodness, whether a struggle or a surrender; while the others suffer changes of generation and destruction, of increase and decrease, of quality and of movement in space. Things then that are mutable are also wholly created. But things that are created must be the work of some maker, and the maker cannot have been created. For if he had been created, he also must surely have been created by some one, and so on till we arrive at something uncreated. The Creator, then, being uncreated, is also wholly immutable. And what could this be other than Deity?

I find this argument really interesting because it is from the patristic period before medieval scholastic philosophy. It seems like ‚Äúmutable‚Äù and ‚Äúimmutable‚Äù would correspond to what we would call ‚Äúcontingent‚Äùand ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù today, while ‚ÄúThings then that are mutable are also wholly created‚Äù seems to be a variation of the PSR to put it into contemporary terms. The creator, being immutable, creator couldn‚Äôt be subject to change (and thus couldn‚Äôt be material). Pretty interesting. 

So would this be a variation of the argument from contingency?",OrthodoxChristianity

Y-DNA &amp; mtDNA haplogroups show that Homo Sapiens came from Western Africa and that the first haplogroup is Haplogroup A00. How could the bible narrative of all humans dispersing from Babel be true, if the common ancestor of all human paternal lines are located in Western Africa?

I'd like creationists to try to explain how Noah's original paternal ancestry is ""preserved"" in Western Africa, but nowhere else, and why the haplogroups of populations the further you go outside of Africa are younger and have more mutations. If we all came from the Tower of Babel wouldn't that be where the oldest common origin of haplogroups be located?

sin and God's will,ElsaTheSnowQueenx,1617202147,"So the bible is clear that God doesn't cause us to sin but isn't there instances where sin is in his will? For example Jesus said many times he MUST suffer and be killed

""And he said, ""The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.""

In fact Jesus even prays not to go through any of this but ultimately does

""Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.""

Now when Jesus is dying he says

""Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."" And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.""

This implies that what the people are doing to Jesus is wrong or at the very least isn't the right thing to do and finally

You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this. By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see. ""Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer. Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord""

This definitely implies that they were wrong for killing Jesus. Words like ""out of ignorance"" and ""repent"" are used as well.

I guess my main question is how does God will and sin play a part in our lives and did the people really sin by killing Jesus if it was in God's will?",OrthodoxChristianity
How do I stop hating Greeks?,GigachadMonkeMode,1617192341,"Every single time I read about something bad coming from Orthodoxy, it always has to do with Greeks and/or Greek hierarchy and the like. Like 99% of cases of phyletism/racism, ecumenism, or liberalism are almost always from a Greek source. Reading about the history of Orthodoxy in America or other anglo countries doesn't help either. Literally every single other Orthodox group made some outreach towards English speaking Americans, except for the Greeks of course. Back when Orthodox Christians were unifying under the Russian mission, the Greeks ignored or resisted it. Almost all future attempts at unity after the Bolsheviks shattered the Russian mission were shot down by the Ecumenical Patriarchate. 

Every single action by Bartholomew or Elpidophoros sure doesn't help. Seems like they live and breathe phyletism and ecumenism with every single footstep they take.

Individual cases of Orthodox parishioners sure doesn't help. Every single case of liberalism, phyletism/racism, and ecumenism seems to come from Greeks. I almost feel intimidated to ever walk into a GOARCH parish. 

The Greeks have an enormous problem seeing the Church as an ethnic club and nothing more. And such, they always succumb to phyletism/racism, ecumenism, liberalism, etc.

I legitimately don't want the Hagia Sophia to be returned in this day and age because that means liberal &amp; racist Greeks will have control over it. And of course it'll only inflate their enormous egos and their racism... ""Haha look we got back this great GREEK building (idc about Orthodoxy all I know is GREEK and GREECE!)!""

Western Elites and Christianity,ValueForm,1617172897,"One thing that strikes me is how virulently anti-Christian much of popular culture is in the West. Christians are generally depicted as crazy at best, bigoted and hateful at worst. Certainly there are many hateful Christians, but I‚Äôve met far more that are loving and forgiving. Regardless, it seems there are precious few positive depictions of Christianity in ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù media. 

At the same time, it seems clear that a significant portion of the upper echelons of the upper classes is morally bankrupt in an extraordinary way. This has become particularly evident in the wake of the Epstein revelations. That there seems to have existed an organized pedophile ring involving many of the world‚Äôs most powerful people might tell us something about those who arguably have the greatest influence on our media (and thereby culture). 

Of course, sin exists in every layer of society, but there is something particularly concerning about the fact that significant sections of the Western world‚Äôs elite display behaviour we would rightly consider beyond the threshold of ‚Äúordinary‚Äù evil. 

To me, it seems there exists some sort of link between the dramatic anti-Christianity of popular media and the interests or desires of the upper rungs of the upper classes. I have a friend who is convinced that there is a lot of Satan-worship going on in this stratum. I wouldn‚Äôt claim as much, as I haven‚Äôt seen enough evidence from credible sources. At the same time, the Epstein saga further evinces the strange proclivity that many elites seem to have for the occult and ‚Äúscience‚Äù that verges on playing God.

To clarify, I am not trying to peddle conspiracy theory. The latter often devolves into antisemitism, which has zero explanatory value. Rather, I am interested in hearing your reflections on the manifest behaviour of many Western elites and the anti-Christian sentiment which dominates the media. 

Further, I don‚Äôt believe that elite hatred/suspicion of Christianity can fully explain the culture‚Äôs ongoing anti-Christian bend. There are clearly other factors and actors involved.

Struggles with doubt after reading about early Christian histories,soulsilver_goldheart,1617115305,"So, I'm struggling with strong feelings of doubt atm. It seems like a consensus among Biblical scholars that Christ's disciples believed in His imminent return to bring a Kingdom of Peace in the First Century, and it was only after this didn't happen that the nascent Great Church and Bishops stepped in to reinterpret those beliefs. I even heard it being compared to Q's ""prophecies"" and Jehovah's Witness prophecies that turned out untrue, then were reinterpreted. Then I got to thinking. I took for granted for a long time that the Christian movement had to be based on a historical resurrection, because no one would have fallen down and worshipped Christ as God (or died for Him) had they not seen the proof with their own eyes.

But, take for example, Rastafari. That faith (in my understanding) still views the late Haile Selassie as God in spite of his very well-documented 20th century life where he appears to be a totally fallible human being and politician, and actively denied being God himself (as he himself was Ethiopian Orthodox).

Obviously I don't hate anyone who is LGBT. Heck, I've gone to church with people who are LGBT.

Hilarion, the sayings of the desert fathers, the teachings of Frater Seraphim Rose, as well as listen to recorded lectures by priests, recorded advices from monks, etc. Everything resonating more and more inside me.

However, I started attending an orthodox parish and its liturgy and its just... not for me? I don't know, I think it's mechanical, my spirituality is very inner and intimate; I also can't feel part of the community... and moreover here in Brazil the orthodox church is an ethnic church, that is, mostly composed of descendants of immigrants preserving their roots, as well as priests and bishops are often outsiders...

Nothing against the parish itself and its community, because it's me that don't fit anywhere at all. I'm kind of autistic and have always been lonesome. I also find it more easily to concentrate on my heart and pray devoutly when I'm utterly alone. Everything else distracts me: people, movements, any 'exterior' thing. The liturgy itself distracts me, the details, images, sounds, movements.

Since the whole pandemic started people have been super anxious regarding the end times, many people who are going to the church think that whatever is happening at the moment is a sign that the end is near since never ever churches were closed, or that the vaccine has the dreaded chip which supposed to be the mark of the beast since many people quote St. Paisios.
As far as I know churches were closed during other pandemics as well, people were far more persecuted, especially during interbelic and postbelic periods of the last world war (everytime I read about the persecutions of Christians during those times it makes me feel sick) and there have been so many other vaccines since St. Paisios gave that prophecy so why do people nowadays think that specifically this vaccine is it? Churches are open now and the services are being held so basically everything was closes just for the first months though in eastern European countries churches were open very shortly after the first lockdown and now you don't even have to wear a mask there if you don't want to.

I figured it was weird and just a dream, but I talked to some of my friends who are Orthodox, and they believed that there might be something to it, but also warned me to be careful of dreams because the devil can use them to deceive people.

Are certain communication patterns representative of Orthodox Christianity or is this spill-over from american evangelicalism,kniebuiging,1616963091,"I grew up somewhat involved in German lutheran* (more specifically the local merger of reformed and lutheran churches) church. Never was a firm believer tbh. I have over the last months read a lot on this subreddit and a bit about OC overall. One thing that definitely resonates with me is the overall deemphasis of 'legalism' that was somewhat prelevant in my religious education (which focused a lot on Martin Luther's struggle with the catholic church, purgatory and the Solas (scriptura, fide, gratia, etc.).

I must maybe add that I lived for a time in the US and Canada, where I got exposed to what American evangelism is like and I even then found it fairly off-putting. Prayers seemed a bit like casting of magic spells, everything maybe a bit of exaggerated.

Now for my question, I hope I am able to phrase this right. There are moments reading on this subreddit or from other sources, where I just get the feeling with certain passages, paragraphs, etc. That feeling is the 'sound' of a southern baptist preaching/lecturing. It feels a bit like sometimes, probably involuntarily, bring in their religious background into the orthodox communities**. I wonder if it makes sense whether I list examples now because then inevitably focus will be on these examples rather than on what interests me: Does anyone else have a similar impression? Is this more of a symptom maybe of large numbers of converts online.

It was just a show to find some relief! It was such a bad mistake!,ErudinamFtwGr,1616934105,"I was resisting/fighting my ocd compulsions by making rushed promises to God that I wont do the compulsions and asking for punishment in case I break the promise by doing the compulsions, in order to use the fear of the punishment to force myself not to do the compulsions and stop worrying. I never wanted to make those promises and I never meant them. They were fake promises in order to trick my ocd so it can shut up. I explained to God that I do not want to make promises and that I am making them because of my ocd. I explained that a real promise would count only under specific conditions and that the promise would need to be validated it with a specific way in order to count as a real promise.

One night, ocd started telling me to do a specific compulsion because of a specific circumstance. I tried to make a fake promise to God about not doing the compulsion but the trick did not work and ocd kept bugging me.I was dizzy from anxiety and I was forced, without wanting, to try and make a real promise. I started saying the promise aloud and a punishment was asked in case breaking the promise. The punishment was the punishment of what I fear.(somehow generic).I tried to validate the promise but I think before finishing the validation, I canceled the promise and explained to God that I did not want to make it and that was my ocd's fault. What if the promise was not canceled? What if other Gods accepted it if Christian God is not real? My ocd is telling me that 1,5 years later MAYBE I did something that it is partially maybe similar to the compulsion of the promise but with a different circumstance.

The punishment that was asked in case breaking the promise, was somehow generic. The punishment of what I fear. As days passed, I was analyzing my problem/my fear/the punishment on reddit. The more I was analyzing/thinking/describing it, the worse my fear of punishment was becoming.Due to anxiety, I was forced to describe and analyze my fear on reddit. By analyzing/writting about it, more ideas of punishment/fear started bugging me. What if Gods read these specific examples/ideas of punishment on reddit? What if They thought that this was the punishment which was asked in that promise, even though my words were more generic when I tried to make the promise?

I will give you an example to understand. Someone makes a promise and in case breaking the prpomise, he asks to be punished with his fear. At that moment/period, his fear was getting fired from his love job. As time passed and the promise was being kept, he started having more fears. In the beginning, his fear was losing his love job. Then, his fear was about losing his love job and being poor forever. Then, his fear was about losing his love job, being poor forever and getting cancer. His fear was not so specific when he made the promise. Since his words about the punishment were about his fear, he wonder how he will be punishe if he breaks the promise. Will he be punished just by losing his love job, since that was his fear when he tried to make the promise, or by losing his job, being poor and getting cancer, since his fear became worse and started analyzing it and describing on reddit?",OrthodoxChristianity

Converting without spouse?,AnonymousInquirer737,1616900443,"Hi, all!

So, I'm sure this question has been asked here before so I apologize if it's redundant. 

I've been drawn to Orthodoxy since about 2016. I've been doing research and praying about it since then, and even attend a local Orhodox church occasionally. My background - I was baptized/raised Episcoplalian, drifted away from God for a while, and then had an intense salvation in 2011 and got baptized in an Evangelical church. I then met my wonderful husband who is also from a similar (Evangelical) background. 

When I discovered Orthodoxy in 2016, I brought it up to my husband but he was very against it (in a kind way, out of concern). We've had long debates and discussions about it ever since. I respect his strong convictions and concern for me, but I can't deny this pull I feel. I've discussed this with a priest which has been helpful. He's kinda letting me go at my own pace and has offered to meet with my husband and me together, but my husband just isn't interested and gets uncomfortable whenever I bring it up. I've decided to stop arguing about it for now and just slow down to pray, discern, and wait. I feel like I should mention we have a great relationship and he's a good man, but this one issue is a struggle for us. 

Does anyone here have a similar experience with their spouse? Any advice? I don't want to go on this journey alone but we're in different places spiritually, it seems.",OrthodoxChristianity
Philosophical critique of modalism,Vasilisonofspiro,1616897331,"Hello brothers and sisters I was wondering if one could point me towards a philosophical critique of modalism ideally one issued by the church fathers. I admire that modalism is incompatible with Christianity going against the words and actions of Christ ( like how He speaks to His Father how the Holy Spirit descends upon Him. Clearly Father and Son are not interchangeable words) It clearly goes against scripture, the fathers and the councils. 

That being said the fathers combatted Arianism not by generating quote mines but rather showing how it is ultimately illogical and destroys the message of Christianity. Yet when it comes to the equally deadly beast of modalism I can find no philosophical arguments by the Fathers. It is usually swept aside in a sentence or two. I find this quite odd as it is much more coherent of a heresy than Arianism. 

If anyone has any philosophical arguments from the fathers, from modern theologians or just your own musings it will be greatly appreciated.",OrthodoxChristianity

Question on Icons/Exodus 20:4 &amp; Veneration/Worship,BrightStudio,1616886657,"Doesn't Exodus 20:4 ban Icons?  Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness *of any thing* that *is* in heaven above, or that *is* in the earth beneath, or that *is* in the water under the earth  


And finally, I'm honestly confused on Veneration &amp; Worship. I mean.. it doesn't look like they are so different at all. Isn't kissing an Icon basically worship? The definition of Worship is ''the feeling or expression of **reverence** and adoration for a deity.'' and the definition of Veneration is ''great respect; **reverence**.''  


When Cornelius attempted to adore Peter by falling down at his feet, wouldn't that also be veneration &amp; worship? I just honestly don't see the difference. And same when John kneeled to an angel, the angel denied him and told him to worship God instead.   


So what exactly is veneration how isn't it worship? The bible doesn't tell us to show veneration or worship to anyone but God. If someone can clear my mind up on this, thank you.",OrthodoxChristianity

I recently started catechism classes. I'm trying to keep an open mind and not let secular passions influence this process. Certain statements by the priest have really bothered me.

Personally, I'm a bit of an anti-zionist. There are very few things about me that are unchangeable and that's one of them. I've learned to keep my opinions to myself and be respectful. However this priest makes anti-Israel statements that even I find inappropriate (and that's saying a lot). 

He also said women shouldn't work outside the home. I'm a working mother and have my dream career.
This is an American priest, either an older millennial or Gen X. In our first meeting he assured me that the parish would accept me as an unwed mother, but by the second meeting he was making judgmental statements about women working. Not sure if it's dogma or his own beliefs, but I don't feel comfortable being taught by someone who inserts their own opinions. I want to learn about the Church and be baptized.

American Orthodox Church?,StJohnMaximovitch,1615863066,"Do you think North America will ever get its own jurisdiction as an independent church?  A parishioner at my parish was talking about how we ought to be our own church (not in the sense of creating our own).  We are an Antiochian parish and he doesn't like some of the ethnic aspects to it (prayers in different languages, the food tends to be fairly ethnic after Liturgies, etc).  At first, I wrote this guy off as just having some prejudices as it sounded borderline racist to me.  I failed to see how separating from the Patriarchate of Antioch would benefit us, especially if the only tangible alternative would be that we could serve hot dogs and hamburgers after DL (something we could already do if the parishioners wanted to).  Not to mention, Orthodoxy has enough issues right now with competing jurisdictions, so the more independent and autocephaleous groups get created, the more complicated things become (in my unlearned opinion).

Prayer beads specifications,neighbor_vadim,1615854607,"So I was doing a bit of reading up on prayer ropes/beads, and I had a question. From my reading, it would seem that while black wool knotting and red beads are traditional, this is optional; you can make a prayer rope from any kind of cord with any color beads (or none at all). However, from my observation (I haven‚Äôt found any reading material on this), if you choose to use prayer beads instead of a prayer rope, the beads are plain wood.

As my user flair indicates, I‚Äôm an inquirer‚Äîcurrently Roman Catholic. As a Catholic, I‚Äôm quite accustomed to praying the rosary, and I have been making rosaries for a while.

I was wondering if it would be okay to make a strand of prayer beads in the same fashion, or if there is some kind of rule or principle against that kind of thing.

When you don't live up to fasting ideals,Genghis-cam,1615818040,"Hi, I have a question. It's my understanding that many (most?) Orthodox Christians don't live up to the whole of the fasting rule for Great Lent, whether to weakness, dietary issues, or whatever else. This is, imo, completely understandable as the fast is quite intense. Given that Great Lent is not entirely (or perhaps even primarily) about fasting, but should equally be about prayer and almsgiving, I'm curious about best practices for people who fail to keep the full fast but really do want to live the spirit of Great Lent. Do you consider it generally best to:

1. attempt to keep the full fast and hold it as ideal even assuming you will fail?
2. purposefully amend the fast to keep the full rules on certain days that you can achieve?
3. purposefully amend the fast rules to something you can keep every day?
4. something else? (elaborate in the comments)

I don't mean to make anybody divulge about their fasting as it is to be done in secret without boasting, but, as I don't know many Orthodox IRL, I don't have people with whom to discuss this.

Jesus Prayer Side Effects?,sentokoo,1615808143,"I am not Orthodox, but I have been learning a lot about it recently and have started saying the Jesus Prayer about 20 - 30 times before bed along with the Lord's Prayer. This has caused some odd things to start happening.

The first night I did this, I woke up and had to vomit in the night. This is a pretty rare event for me. The last time I threw up was probably over a year ago from food poisoning. Still, I wrote it off to the fact that I drank a little juice before bed and maybe it was too acidic for my stomach.

The second time I said the Jesus Prayer before bed was last night. I was woken up at 1 AM by my wife who was frightened and said that our bedroom television had turned on by itself. I am trying to look up a rational explanation for this, but honestly I am pretty freaked out. The television remote was sitting on a bedside table with nothing touching it or on top of it. Although at this point I could still write it off as a coincedence.

But now I'm afraid to continue saying the Jesus Prayer in case more weird stuff continues to happen. At some point it will be too much to write off as a coincedence any more.

In some of the interviews with Orthodox clergy I've been watching, they mention the Jesus Prayer and prayer rope as basically a sword for use in spiritual warfare. When I heard this I thought it was just an overdramatic way of saying that it helps people to prevent sinning etc, but now I wonder if there is more to it.

I've also heard people who became Orthodox have the church basically ask them if they're sure they want to do it, because once they know certain things they cant go back and ignorance any more. I dont know what this is alluding to but I think maybe it is related as well.

Basically I think that me saying the Jesus Prayer is upsetting something within me or my house. I'm wondering what the Orthodox perspective on things like demons or ghosts is, and if there is anything to suggest that reciting the Jesus Prayer may anger these kinds of spirits and cause them to lash out.

I know this probably sounds crazy, and if it wasnt happening to me I would agree. On one hand this is making me afraid to continue pursuing Orthodoxy and prayer. On the other hand it feels like it must be doing something or clearing some kind of negative energy so I should go into it even deeper.

Hello. I'm a current agnostic who is wondering about (and maybe considering) Eastern Orthodoxy.,iod_21,1615791296,"Can someone help. I'm very desperate and stressed. I'll explain my current position:

I was raised in a Roman Catholic family, but I stopped believing at around age 12 and drifted away into agnosticism, atheism and deism. I have tried to return to the church, but I've realized the things that are going on with the Pope. In addition, I have also become aware of the changes made by Vatican 2. I have also delved into Sedevacantism, and it sounds reasonable compared to modern Catholicism/Vatican 2 sect/etc. From what I've heard, they are very cult-like, but I've never spoken with any Sedevacantists in person nor have I attended any of their churches/groups. 

I believe in evolution and in all science. I have very conservative views (i.e., I don't support the LGBT, nor abortion, etc.) Personally, I don't believe that a person outside the Catholic religion will go to Hell solely because he or she is not a Catholic. I know that this is contrary to the views of the Catholic church throughout history. Does the Eastern Orthodox church believe that all non-Eastern Orthodox go to Hell? 

Can someone help me with more information about Eastern Orthodoxy? I probably won't be able to get into it now nor anytime soon, but I'll be sure to come back to it when I can.

Resurrection / Anastasi(os/a) - Significance / Importance?,greekdished,1615720545,"Hey guys! In many religions there are sacred names (surnames and names), in Orthodoxy I know The Holy Trinity and Maria and such are important of course, but I‚Äôve always been fascinated by names that are directly and etymologically inspired by ‚Äúevents‚Äù in the theological aspect of the religion, such as Ressurection so Anastasi so Anastasios(a). 

Why would someone be named the Resurrection of Christ (or it is limited to just the concept of resurrection in general?)

This event is highly important and significant in the scripture and religion, so when was the name first being attributed and where did it come from first, was there some type of methodology of gatekeeping of who was allowed to both be named this or which parent could decide to name their kid this? 

If we look at it from a symbolic and more divine and spiritual way, what would the metaphor be based on that the name would carry? As in this individual is a ressurection of some sort? Or that they would be a divinity of the nature to someone who promotes and secretes the vibrations and energy of someone capable of inspiring resurrection and rebirth and rechanneling etc. Not sure if it makes sense.. it‚Äôs just names without an Agios/Saint always fascinated me.

Info on this Icons,gr3tchn,1615662795,"Hi! My grandmother inherited this icon from her friend and gave it to me to investigate. I don't know where her friend got it, as she was not Eastern European and neither is my family. I know almost nothing about Eastern orthodox Christianity, so I went to this sub to find out about this icon. I had never heard of icons before I found this item, and I'm interested to figure out anything about this one. There is a tiny engraving on the bottom that says ""1891.""  I have identified some of the people and some of the other texts using google translate from Ukrainian (see notes) but a lot of the characters are different than the keyboard ones so it's hard to be exact. I'm especially interested in the figure of the woman (second from left) whose name is just one letter. There are a lot of abbreviations on this icon that are hard to translate too, like ones for saints and martyrs. Any help is appreciated, thanks!

Orthodoxy in the British Isles,_InRainbows,1615652063,"Hi all,

I've always been irreligious but for a little over a year I've been increasingly starting to question whether there is something for me in faith. I'm still very early on this journey, and I don't know whether I'll be capable of making the leap into truly believing, or even whether I'll want to, but I'm committed to at least exploring further.

Orthodoxy has spoken to me the most out of the denominations I've looked into, in large part due to the lack of papal infallibility and its status as the original apostolic church. My only issue is that orthodox Christianity in the UK is not widespread, or at least not very visible, and the presence I have found seems to be split between three different strands.

There's the Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain, which is as far as I can tell a part of the Eastern Orthodox Church under Constantinople. But there's also the British Orthodox Church, which is an independent Oriental Orthodox church, and the Celtic Orthodox Church, which has only one parish in the UK and is more widespread in France. It's independent but ordained by Syriac bishops, so I believe I'm right in saying that they too are more Oriental-inclined.

Truthfully, and I state this from a position of doctrinal ignorance and pure instinctive emotion, I'm most drawn to the Celtic Orthodox Church. I can't really say why, other than it feels rooted in my own history in a way the others don't. But I'm not sure that's a sound reason for choosing a church, and in any case its only parish is nowhere near where I'm based.

I've rambled for a bit, so thank you sincerely for reading this far if you've done so. I know the ideal thing would be for me to visit a church and meet with clergy, but that's not possible right now and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I'd be so grateful to hear the thoughts of the community on this issue, if you don't mind humouring my ignorance.

Thank you in advance, and God bless.",OrthodoxChristianity

Doubt and Worrying thoughts about life and death.,TonnyLehmann,1615626375," I was raised as a Christian but I have almost, lost my faith. I have heard opinions from agnostics or atheists and some of them made sense to me. I have also read about some seemingly at least Bible contradictions.I started questioning the reason of having faith to get saved and why God would send people to Hell for not believing in Him. I mean, in faith it is natural for some people to have faith and some others not to have faith. 

For example, someone may have faith that their sports team will win but an other may not have faith.Some may have faith that it will rain, may believe that it wont rain.So, when it comes to the Bible, it is natural for some people to believe that the Bible is the word of God and some others to belivee that it is not!I cant blame them for that. And I cant understand why God, if He would send them to hell, why He would. Faith seems to me like gambling a little. There will be losers. So, I cant understand faith.
 
 Many people support their faith by saying stuff like ""Bible is really the word of God"" or ""Christianity makes sense"". Well, its ok if the Christianity makes sense to them but there are people in which Christianity did NOT make sense and in the same way, they rejected it. I am not talking about people who want to do drugs, have sex with a lot of women etc. For example, I have a very honest and humble friend who I think stopped believing but he is a very good person. You could say that he is a very good Christian without being Christian. I cant understand why God would send people like him to hell for rejecting Jesus.

 My question is this: How you know that the Bible is really the word of God when there are many other religions out there? It is a difficult question that probably, cant be answered. It always comes to personal OPINIONS AND BELIEFS. Which is something natural. But, that also means that it is natural for some people to believe that the Bible is not the word of God. Thats why I used the word ""gambling"". 


 Anyway, I am confused and lost and I cant be ""Jesus is real"" etc. I always will get the thoughts like ""What if He is not?"" etc. If I ignore those thoughts and kept acting and saying ""Jesus is real"" I feel like I am getting brainwashed. So, I have almost lost my faith. And now, not only, I worry for what will happen if in case Jesus is real but I also worry if in case Jesus is not real. What if there is no God and when we die we are nothing? That makes me sad when I think that my loved dead ones are nothing. I wont care when I die but now, its a sad thought.


 Also, I think about being born again in a different body. It makes a little sense to me. Suddenly, I was born and now I am living my life. What if the same thing happened in the past? People have been living for many years. i was born in 1992. Why 1992? Maybe I was also, born in 1910 and died and then, gained a new life.


Anyway, I have been thinking a lot about this. I think many people are Christians from fear. They were raised as kids to be Christians and now, they see many people around them to be Christians so they keep being Christians. I wonder if Christianity was not so spread as much as it is today, would those people still be Christians? What if Christianity was made  by people in order to bring some order in the world and due to tradition, it kept spreading til today? We know that people can easily be deluded. (look politics for example). What if Christianity is a delusion that kept spreading til today, due to tradition?",OrthodoxChristianity

Does god hate,ropestring3,1615614111,"I many times hear from Christians that god loves everyone. However I see multiple bible quotes to challenge this idea:

###  Proverbs 6:16-19

There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.

###  Psalm 5:4-6

For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you. The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers. You destroy those who speak lies; the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.

### Romans 9:13

 As it is written, ‚ÄúJacob I loved, but Esau I hated.‚Äù 

### Psalm 11:5

The Lord tests the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.

 

### Psalm 97:10

O you who love the Lord, hate evil! He preserves the lives of his saints; he delivers them from the hand of the wicked.

I want to become an Orthodox Christian.,JFKisAFK1963,1615608142,"I was essentially born Roman Catholic until my mom converted to Protestantism when I was around the age of 10. I rapidly lost faith, and around 13 I stopped attending church completely.

I never went back to the Catholic Church because of all the sexual abuse controversies, and the idea of the Pope being infallible just didn‚Äôt seem right to me.

Living in rural America, I had never even heard of the Eastern Orthodox Church, because almost everyone I know is Protestant or atheist and the rest of my family is Catholic. I feel very drawn to Orthodoxy, because I feel like it is what Jesus intended the Church to be.

https://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/tertullian-martyrdom-perpetua-and-felicity/

Epiphanius was a master of many languages and a scholar of profound biblical culture. He had a passion for pure doctrine‚Äîand a pure loathing for error in all its forms. He labored through a long life to root heresy out of the Church. He distrusted classical literature because of the taint of idolatry. He compiled a reference work he called his ‚ÄúMedicine Chest,‚Äù diagnosing erroneous doctrines as ‚Äúsnakebites‚Äù and then prescribing cures from the pharmacy of true doctrine. In pursuing clarity, he forced Christians to take sides. But he didn‚Äôt always take into account his own capacity to misjudge, and his zealotry sometimes led to unnecessary division. In one case it helped bring about the downfall of a great saint.

There are other religions/traditions too. Why I should consider them as false but accept Christianity? If it cant be proved that the Bible is really the word of God then,it is natural for me to lose faith etc etc.

Also, some people said that they are Christians because to them Christianity made sense or something like that. To me some things in Christianity do not make sense. For example, why would God create us and give us free will but also, have some rules in order to get to heaven. I am not talking about being good person etc.

 I am talking about other rules (according to some priests) like no sex before marriage, going to church every time, fasting in Wednesday and Friday (orthodoxy), having faith. Some people maybe be good people but agnostic. Do those really deserve hell? Why would God send an honest agnostic to be tormented in hell for eternity?

Also, I have been told that we all deserve hell and Jesus is the savor. Why we all deserve hell? Is it our nature? if it is our nature then its not our fault. Since some Christians say that to them Christianity make sense, then, its natural for me to say that some things in CHristianity or at least how the churches present them, do not make sense.

 Do I deserve hell for losing my faith or feeling like an agnostic? Of course I try to follow Jesus, just in case He is real, but I cant be ""Jesus is real 100%"" I have heard opinions from Christians and agnostics.

And I want to be honest but I cant understand why God would give us free will and have rules that someone would easily break. Do not forget about the narrow way. I cant understand why my nature is sinful and that I need a savior and that I need to have faith in Him to get saved. It is natural for some people NOT to have faith for various reasons.

The same thing happened to me a week ago during the service, during the mention of the name of the Most Holy Mother of God, those insulting thoughts happened, more precisely, I did not allow my brain to speak because I fought against it with all my strength and I was very upset. 80% of the liturgy I was happy but those 20% crippled me. I came home in tears literally because those thoughts happen to me, which are inappropriate for such a place where I am. A couple of times it has happened to me to struggle with myself not to think about some black, sexual thoughts, thoughts about illness. I was so scared and panicked that I am convinced that if I continue to think like this, or have sex with my girlfriend, or if my attitude or my opinion differs from the opinion of the church or some clergyman, that God will punish me with some disease, I don't know why I've been so burdened with diseases lately (I'm generally hypochondriac, and I had a severe hypochondria attack a month ago, Thank God, everything is fine with health) The problem is that I never knew how to let go of those thoughts just, not to fight them. 

Then I read about these intrusive thoughts and realized that it is not a rare thing and that it happens often to people. that it's actually an ocd disorder, since I've often had ""rituals"" when I come to church, that I need to kiss all the icons, or that I have to come every week.  Sometimes I even have a reflex when I cross myself. I used to burp, now I have a stiffness in my neck and a feeling in my ""groin"" so that I don't express myself ugly (nothing sexual attracts me, nothing perverted) I just feel such pressure. I wonder if anyone has encountered this? I went to therapy and I will mention it to my doctor.

 I believe in God and I like to go to church on Sundays to pray for my loved ones, for myself, to thank God for everything he has given me. What happened to me will not take me away from the church and the faith, I am just determined to visit the doctor, as well as the priest, I want to solve my mental problems that I have caused over the years. At the end of the day I always try to be a better person, a better person, thank you for reading, I wish you all the best",OrthodoxChristianity

But I'd like to address these points directly with this Catholic, if I can.  Anywhere, here's the wall of text:

&amp;#x200B;

It is. I don't even know why the mods tolerate your insolent heresies being put on this sub. A catholic either belives in papal supremacy, or they put themselves outside any chance of salvation.

As for history:

&gt;Owing to the sudden and repeated calamities and misfortunes which have befallen us, we must acknowledge that we have been somewhat tardy in turning our attention to the matters in dispute among you, beloved; and especially that abominable and unholy sedition, alien and foreign to the elect of God, which a few rash and self-willed persons have inflamed to such madness that your venerable and illustrious name, worthy to be loved by all men, has been greatly defamed. . . . Accept our counsel and you will have nothing to regret. . . . If anyone disobey the things which have been said by him \[God\] through us \[i.e., that you must reinstate your leaders\], let them know that they will involve themselves in transgression and in no small danger. . . . You will afford us joy and gladness if being obedient to the things which we have written through the Holy Spirit, you will root out the wicked passion of jealousy‚Äù

\- (*Letter to the Corinthians*¬†1, 58‚Äì59, 63 \[A.D. 80\]

&gt;But since it would be too long to enumerate in such a volume as this the succession of all the churches, we shall confound all those who, in whatever manner, whether through self-satisfaction or vainglory, or through blindness and wicked opinion, assemble other than where it is proper, by pointing out here the successions of the bishops of the greatest and most ancient church known to all, founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, that church which has the tradition and the faith which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the apostles. With that church, because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree, that is, all the faithful in the whole world, and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition‚Äù¬†

*(Against Heresies*¬†3:3:2 \[A.D. 189\]

&gt;The Lord says to Peter: ‚ÄòI say to you,‚Äô he says, ‚Äòthat you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it. And to you I will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever things you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth, they shall be loosed also in heaven‚Äô \[Matt. 16:18‚Äì19\]). . . . On him \[Peter\] he builds the Church, and to him he gives the command to feed the sheep \[John 21:17\], and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair \[*cathedra*\], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity. Indeed, the others were also what Peter was \[i.e., apostles\], but a primacy is given to Peter, whereby it is made clear that there is but one Church and one chair. So too, all \[the apostles\] are shepherds, and the flock is shown to be one, fed by all the apostles in single-minded accord. If someone does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he imagine that he still holds the faith? If he \[should\] desert the chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built, can he still be confident that he is in the Church?‚Äù

(*The Unity of the Catholic Church*¬†4; 1st edition \[A.D. 251\]

&gt;Cyprian to \[Pope\] Cornelius, his brother. Greeting. . . . We decided to send and are sending a letter to you from all throughout the province \[where I am\] so that all our colleagues might give their decided approval and support to you and to your communion, that is, to both the unity and the charity of the Catholic Church‚Äù

(*Letters*¬†48:1, 3 \[A.D. 253\]

&gt;With a false bishop appointed for themselves by heretics, they dare even to set sail and carry letters from schismatics and blasphemers to the chair of Peter and to the principal church \[at Rome\], in which sacerdotal unity has its source‚Äù

(ibid., 59:14).

&gt;\[The\] judgment \[concerning Athanasius\] ought to have been made, not as it was, but according to the ecclesiastical canon. It behooved all of you to write us so that the justice of it might be seen as emanating from all. . . . Are you ignorant that the custom has been to write first to us and then for a just decision to be passed from this place \[Rome\]? If, then, any such suspicion rested upon the bishop there \[Athanasius of Alexandria\], notice of it ought to have been written to the church here. But now, after having done as they pleased, they want to obtain our concurrence, although we never condemned him. Not thus are the constitutions of Paul, not thus the traditions of the Fathers. This is another form of procedure, and a novel practice. . . . What I write about this is for the common good. For what we have heard from the blessed apostle Peter, these things I signify to you‚Äù

(*Letter on Behalf of Athanasius*¬†\[A.D. 341\]

&gt;\[Simon Magus\] so deceived the city of Rome that Claudius erected a statue of him. . . . While the error was extending itself, Peter and Paul arrived, a noble pair and the rulers of the Church, and they set the error aright. . . . \[T\]hey launched the weapon of their like-mindedness in prayer against the Magus, and struck him down to earth. It was marvelous enough, and yet no marvel at all, for Peter was there‚Äîhe that carries about the keys of heaven \[Matt. 16:19\]

(*Catechetical Lectures*¬†6:14 \[A.D. 350\]

&gt;‚Äú\[Jesus said:\] Simon, my follower, I have made you the foundation of the holy Church. I betimes called you Peter, because you will support all its buildings. You are the inspector of those who will build on Earth a Church for me. If they should wish to build what is false, you, the foundation, will condemn them. You are the head of the fountain from which my teaching flows; you are the chief of my disciples. Through you I will give drink to all peoples. Yours is that life-giving sweetness which I dispense. I have chosen you to be, as it were, the firstborn in my institution so that, as the heir, you may be executor of my treasures. I have given you the keys of my kingdom. Behold, I have given you authority over all my treasures‚Äù

(*Homilies*¬†4:1 \[A.D. 351\]

&gt;Likewise it is decreed . . . that it ought to be announced that . . . the holy Roman Church has been placed at the forefront not by the conciliar decisions of other churches, but has received the primacy by the evangelic voice of our Lord and Savior, who says: ‚ÄòYou are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it; and I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven . . . ‚Äô \[Matt. 16:18‚Äì19\]. The first see, therefore, is that of Peter the apostle, that of the Roman Church, which has neither stain nor blemish nor anything like it‚Äù

(*Decree of Damasus*¬†3 \[A.D. 382\]

&gt;In seeking the things of God . . . you have acknowledged that judgment is to be referred to us \[the pope\], and have shown that you know that is owed to the Apostolic See \[Rome\], if all of us placed in this position are to desire to follow the apostle himself \[Peter\] from whom the episcopate itself and the total authority of this name have emerged‚Äù

"I want to come back to the Church, but I don't think it's a good idea to go back to my home parish.",bigcisco00,1615414593,"Hello all! I just found this sub and I'm so glad I discovered it. After quite a number of years falling away completely from the Orthodox Church, I am ready to come back and rekindle my faith in Jesus Christ. I am unsure where to start, I am feeling nervous, and I am seeking support and advice.

When I was around 7, my parents decided to convert to Orthodoxy. We began going to an OCA church in my area. My parents took a chatecumin class and we were all baptized. My parents were very invloved in the church, including serving on parish council, directing the choir, teaching Sunday school, and more. I went to youth group every Sunday, and despite coming from a poor family I was able to go to a wonderful Antiochian summer camp on a scholarship for a few years. That camp and the services there as well as all the wonderful clergy and mentors are what really made me fall in love with my religion.

Unfortunately, my parents seemed to be more interested in status and appearing perfect on the outside than worshipping God in the church. At home, it was a different story. My parents are severe alcoholics, they abused my siblings and I, and eventually just stopped going to church completely. My father would take the bible out of context and use the holy scripture as a means of justification and control. There was one occasion where they volunteered to make the prosfora. They got drunk, made the dough in a bread maker, pressed the holy seal into it without saying the proper prayers, and presented it to the church to be transformed into the Eucharist.

This is what drove me to turn away from God. Throughout my teen years I believed a number of different things, at one point turning away from Him completely. I was being beat on a daily basis and was kicked out of the home several times. It was very volitile. I got myself into bad situations, became an addict myself, consumed drugs and alcohol, stopped going to church completely, and became consumed by a life of sin. 

Well, things got bad enough for me to try praying again, and God sent me a wonderful, honest young man who accepted me into his family. His parents took me under their wing. They themselves were alcoholics, but they were spared from the disease and just celebrated one year sober. My boyfriend's stepdad has since started going to church again (he was raised Baptist.) He is a father figure to me, and we have since had many great discussions about God and Christianity, and we've been sharing what we have learned along the way. I've been sharing what knowledge I have of the Orthodox faith, and he's been sharing what he's been learning studying the Bible. 

This has inspired me to come back to the Orthodox faith with fresh eyes. I feel like I got scammed out of a proper faith in my adolescence. My boyfriend said he would also be interested in coming to church with me.

Unfortunately, the only church that isnt doing remote/20 cap services in my area is my home parish. My parents still turn up there occasionally, and I do not want to draw attention to the situation. I no longer communicate with them, they are not a part of my life and I feel that that's the way it should be. Many of the parishioners watched me grow up. They will all be asking me where I've been, and I don't want that. I don't want my parents to be rejected by the church goers in case they decide to change for the better. I want them to be able to feel included in the community just in case they too come back to the faith. I also want to be able to go to church without that anxiety and distraction.

(He will move back in several years as this is where he wants to retire so we are incredibly thankful for that)

We have an altar server that has served for years, but he is the only server we have really since until recently, it has been mostly very old people or babies at the church. My husband and another young man are newly eligible to serve, so they will be trained and a new young man that is already Orthodox has just joined our parish so I hope he is willing to serve. 

They were going to fly the priest and the current server to Boston to be tonsured but in talking with the Bishop, learned that he will be traveling through our state this weekend. Instead of flying to Boston, they are able to drive down and meet him.

It will likely still be a couple months until we are able to do a High Mass again, while everyone learns their new roles, but WOW did everything just fall perfectly into place!!

Orthodox interpretation of Romans 5?,JamieOfArc,1615390057,"Romans 5 (NIV:

&gt; ***12***¬†*Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way* ***death came to all people, because all sinned****‚Äî*  
&gt;  
&gt;***13***¬†*To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone‚Äôs account where there is no law.* ***14***¬†*Nevertheless,* ***death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command****, as did Adam, who is a pattern of the one to come.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***15***¬†*But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God‚Äôs grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!* ***16***¬†*Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man‚Äôs sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.* ***17***¬†*For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God‚Äôs abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!*  
&gt;  
&gt;***18***¬†*Consequently, just* ***as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people****, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people.* ***19***¬†*For just as* ***through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners****, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.*

Eastern-Orthodoxy teaches that we inherit the consequences of Adams and Eves sin (death, a weak nature prone to sin), but not the guilt. So unlike the catholics (and some protestants), orthodox do not believe that children are born sinners. They are just born with a weak nature prone to sin as a result of original sin.

Romans 5:12-18 seems to say that all people are guilty of Adams sin. Is it because this is a western (protestant) translation or is my understanding wrong?",OrthodoxChristianity

I am a 17 year old catechumen, born and raised in the Netherlands and attending a Greek Orthodox parish under the EP.

In May, I will be leaving the Netherlands for Portugal. I intend to settle there permanently. However, I've been having extreme difficulty finding an orthodox church in Portugal.

I've tried to look for orthodox directories, but the searches through them haven't been fruitful. I have tried looking for a parish under ROCOR, and while a church was listed on their directory, an actual adress or contact info was missing.

Greetings, since I haven't gone to the priest yet, and I need to go to confession and talk to him in general soon, I'm interested in a few things. I had a stressful period of excessive health care / hypochondria, and generally that‚Äôs when I started thinking about religion, the church, the  God more than ever. All my life I considered myself a believer, for many years I prayed in the evening and in the morning, I went to church on Sundays to pray, I did not go to liturgies and services so often, but I never had the courage to talk to myself about topics related to for religion. The point is that it scares me if my opinion differs from the opinion of a monk, or a person who is with the church, a priest, if my opinion may differ from the opinion of the church. Of course, I try like all of us (maybe in a conscious, maybe not unconscious way) to keep God's commandments, of course, even if I wasn't in religion, I would never want to kill, steal, cheat on a girl / woman, etc. I'm a completely normal guy who's 23 years old, doing things that a normal 23-year-old does. One of the things I will mention in the confession will certainly be my consumption of narcotics in the past, as well as doing that job. I haven't taken any drugs in 3.4 years, sometimes I like to go have fun with my friends to drink beer, but I see that it doesn't happen often because I know it's bad for my body, so it happens once. weekly or once every 2.3 weeks. The thing is that I am afraid of something, that I feel afraid to say something related to religion, for example if I don't like something or don't understand, such as sex before marriage, it's a normal phenomenon and healthy above all and I think it is normally yes if i'm with my girlfriend i'm going to have that in a relationship. Also another thing that happens to me is that sometimes I get attacked by some ugly , I can't say thoughts, because those are not things I think about, but these are thoughts that go through my head and I haven't learned not to pay too much attention to them , so it goes through my head out of pure peace that I am a pedophile or that I am a homosexual, although on a conscious and reasonable level I know that I am not and then I get upset. Here the other day when I was on service, during the service I felt calm and happy 70-80% of the time, but again some of my thoughts managed to disturb me, in a way I had a feeling that I was insulting the saints, that I was insulting the Most Holy Mother of God , to insult the people who are in the church, I didn't say anything consciously, those are some thoughts that flew through my head. When I mentioned this to my psychotherapist, not about those thoughts in church but in general, about those thoughts of mine that fly through my head and I just can‚Äôt ignore them and she herself said that a million thoughts go through my head regularly without such thoughts we should give and pay attention and we should not fight with them because we cannot defeat them. Thus  after that service, instead of being calm and happy and cleansed, I came home upset and crying because those thoughts are happening to me in such a holy place and I don‚Äôt want them to happen. I'm afraid not to blaspheme, it scares me too much, because I don't want to have such thoughts. It also happened to me that during masturbation the image of the Most Holy Mother of God passed through my head, so nothing in a perverted, twisted, strange way, just that image went through my head and  It shook me so much, that now when  I have  to see my girlfriend, that I just have a trauma, that these pictures won't happen to me again, and that worries and upsets me , no matter what we do, i created trauma now. So I know that I am not a perverted and strange man, but I do not know why it goes through my head and why I can not defend myself from these thoughts, how can I not pay attention to them, I will certainly say all this to the confessing father, but also the first time I see my doctor I will tell her that I have the biggest problem with that, because if I knew how to just let go of those flying thoughts I would not make a problem for myself not only for this case but in general. I wouldn't have hypochondria, I wouldn't be too scared really, if I could just let those thoughts go, not fight them. I don't know if anyone understands me, if maybe something similar happened to someone, I would like to hear your opinion in general, as well as maybe some advice. Certainly, this will not discourage me, it will not distract me from faith, it has also shown me that I need to go to psychotherapy regularly, to solve the problem of these obsessive thoughts.

"What does it mean that Jesus will overthrow the antichrist with the breath of his mouth in 2 Thessalonians 2:8, and what is the sword in Revelation 19:13 and Revelation 19:21?",BibleSharer,1615312746,"&amp;#x200B;

And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. (2 Thessalonians 2:8 ‚Äì New International Version 1984).

&amp;#x200B;

Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. ""He will rule them with an iron scepter."" He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. (Revelation 19:15 ‚Äì New International Version 1984).

&amp;#x200B;

The rest were slain with the sword that came out of the mouth of him who was on the horse, and all the birds were satisfied with their flesh. (Revelation 19:21 - The New Revised 1994).

&amp;#x200B;

2 Thessalonians 2:8 quotes Isaiah 11:4.

&amp;#x200B;

The term translated ""breath"" in the verse is the same Greek term ""pneuma"" from which is translated ""spirit,"" ""Spirit,"" etc.

Revelation 19:15 and Revelation 19:21 describe Christ at his second coming with a sword coming out of his mouth. This sword is a double-edged sword (Revelation 1:16). The sword that comes out of his mouth is the sword of the Spirit, and the sword of the Spirit is the word of God (Ephesians 6:17).

&amp;#x200B;

By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth. (Psalms 33:6 ‚Äì New International Version 1984).

&amp;#x200B;

When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth. (Psalms 104:30 ‚Äì New International Version 1984).

&amp;#x200B;

As Psalms 33:6 and Psalms 104:30 make clear, the breath is the Spirit, and God creates by word and Spirit.

&amp;#x200B;

God the Father created all things through Jesus (Colossians 1:16). For this reason Christ is called the Word of God (John 1:1; Revelation 19:13); but the two-edged sword that comes out of Christ's mouth is the word of God which however does not indicate Christ himself. If Christ himself is the Word of God (Revelation 19:13), it is therefore wrong to think that that sword coming out of his mouth (which is the word of God) is Christ himself. Then the sword in Revelation 19:13 and Revelation 19:21, which is the word of God, is the word of God only in the abstract sense without indicating Christ.

&amp;#x200B;

But the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who had performed the miraculous signs on his behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped his image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. (Revelation 19:20 ‚Äì New International Version 1984).

&amp;#x200B;

The beast in Revelation 19:20 is the antichrist, the lawless one mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2:8. As we can see, Revelation 19:20 does not say that the antichrist and the false prophet (the beast of Revelation 13:11)) will be slain with the sword, unlike the rest who will be slain with the sword, as Revelation 19:21 says.

In relation to 2 Thessalonians 2:8 which speaks only of the antichrist, i.e. the beast of Revelation 19:20, we understand that 2 Thessalonians 2:8 wants to say that the antichrist will be overthrown with the breath of Christ's mouth, i.e. with the Spirit.",OrthodoxChristianity

‚ÄùEverything in this life passes away ‚Äî only God remains, only He is worth struggling towards.

‚ÄúFrom this day forth from this very hour and this very minute, let us love love God above all and seek to accomplish His Holy Will.‚Äù
‚Äî St. Herman of Alaska

‚ÄúA true Christian is made by faith and love toward Christ. Our sins do not in the least hinder our Christianity, according to the word of the Savior Himself. He deigned to say: not the righteous have I come to call, but sinners to salvation; there is more joy in heaven over one who repents than over ninety righteous ones. Likewise concerning the sinful woman who touched His feet, He deigned to say to the Pharisee Simon: to one who has love, a great debt is forgiven, but from one who has no love, even a small debt will be demanded. From these judgments a Christian should bring himself to hope and joy, and not in the least accept an inflicted despair. Here one needs the shield of faith.‚Äù
‚Äî St. Herman of Alaska

‚ÄúDo not be ashamed to enter again into the Church. Be ashamed when you sin. Do not be ashamed when you repent. Pay attention to what the devil did to you. These are two things: sin and repentance. Sin is a wound; repentance is a medicine. Just as there are for the body wounds and medicines, so for the soul are sins and repentance. However, sin has the shame and repentance possesses the courage.‚Äù
‚Äî St. John Chrysostom

‚ÄùThe love of husband and wife is the force that welds society together. Men will take up arms and even sacrifice their lives for the sake of this love‚Ä¶.when harmony prevails, the children are raised well, the household is kept in order, and neighbors, friends, and relatives praise the result. Great benefits, both of families and states, are thus produced. When it is otherwise, however, everything is thrown into confusion and turned upside-down.‚Äù
‚Äî St. John Chrysostom

‚ÄúFor Christians above all men are forbidden to correct the stumblings of sinners by force‚Ä¶it is necessary to make a man better not by force but by persuasion. We neither have authority granted us by law to restrain sinners, nor, if it were, should we know how to use it, since God gives the crown to those who are kept from evil, not by force, but by choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe saints are exceedingly loving and gentle to mankind, and even to brute beasts‚Ä¶Surely we ought to show them (animals) great kindness and gentleness for many reasons, but, above all, because they are of the same origin as ourselves.‚Äù
‚Äî St. John Chrysostom

""God allowed (Mankind to experience the Fall) through the suffering and hardships inflicted on him through matter, (so that he) might come to an awareness of himself and his former dignity and gladly detach himself from his sinful love for the body and his infatuation with material things. For the infinitely wise God, who providentially directs the course of our lives, allows us to use material things according to our own impulses in a way that leads to our correction. We often see this among those who habitually abuse material things, for by means of the very confusion and turmoil which both surrounds and is generated by these things, God redirects their irrational lust for the things of this world to a natural and divine object of desire.""

Strong Difference of Opinion: Planned Parenthood,cakefordindins,1615295201,"I know I need to discuss this with my priest: I'm hoping to get guidance on how. (For the record, I couldn't say anything at the time because my child was having tantrums)

Last night was a weekly church meeting. One member spoke on how they had been protesting at Planned Parenthood all week, and even got someone to turn around. She spoke of how she was getting a sonogram machine to show the unborn baby, because Planned Parenthood doesn't.

Of course, it was all sorts of praise and thanking God for this. Tons of thoughts on how to continue and improve on this. 

Then, someone else spoke up, asking what we could do to help these expectant mothers raise these babies. What resources did we have available, what donations could we bring? How we could secure the future for these unborn children?

The responses were ""the government has programs,"" or other seemingly dismissive responses. Much fewer responses, I might add. 

Our priest spoke of attempts to reverse the death penalty. Nobody offered a comment. 

I'm sickened in so many ways. Firstly, I simply do not agree with standing outside a planned parenthood: some women are there to receive aftercare for lost pregnancies, and to be accosted by protestors is psychologically devastating. Why aren't we protesting the capitols? The lawmakers? Instead, we shame the women who need help, forgiveness, and understanding. What happened to not casting stones?

"How can the two Orthodox Patriarchates of Constantinople survive under such oppressive, suffocating Turkish persecution?",TiredTemptress,1615268090,"(Sorry for my bad English; I hope what I say makes sense). I recently read about the draconian, ridiculous laws Turkey/Erdoghan imposed on the Christian communities in Istanbul, especially the two Patriarchates: Ecumenical Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the Armenian Orthodox Patriarchate. There‚Äôs a lot of persecution, from confiscation of church property to taxation. But, what really boiled my blood is how Turkey is literally suffocating these two churches to death by depriving the Patriarchates of new priests, and, thus, future bishops/patriarchs. Turkey‚Äôs constitution imposes a requirement the patriarchs must be born in Turkey and be full Turkish citizens while, at the same time, it is illegal to operate a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù (not state regulated) school in Turkey.  As such, neither Patriarchate now has an open/active seminary in Turkey. Christian Children will be sent to public Turkish schools, not learn Greek/Armenian, have no vocation. Even if they do have an interest in the priesthood, they will have to go abroad for their seminary where they will assimilated into diaspora or be assigned to other regions of the world. These oppressive barriers will eventually limit the pool of bishops that can be patriarch, slowly suffocating these historic sees to death.

The possible disparities in the way different orthodox Christians make the cross sign,goodman_1379,1615266502,"I am a member of The Holy Indian Orthodox established by St. Thomas. My church had long lasting relationships with the church of Persia, and when they were killed and that church was no more, we also developed relations to the Syrian church of Antioch and revised our traditional classical Syriac rites. All of these churches are under Oriental orthodoxy that is non-calcidonian and miaphysites with respect to their belief in nature of Christ.
Our traditional act of making a cross is supported by the following silent prayer:

1) ""our lord and saviour came from heaven into this earth, ... ""    saying this, 
 we take right hand our thumb, index and middle finger, join them, take them from the forehead to our chest 
2) "".. to our world which was fallen by sin, ....."" , and take our hand to the left shoulder. (Left being the traditional and biblical representation of sinned state)
3)""... Redeemed us to make made of the right.""   and take the hand to our right shoulder.( right being the biblical metaphor of the saved state)

But when I happened to see a Byzantine Christian making a cross sign from right side to left, I was perplexed. Because in our tradition it is the right opposite of what Christ did. 

In my opinion this must have been a confusion that occurred as, when the priest makes the symbol of cross to the masses, from his view though it is left side to right side, the people's perspective of reversed and they started copying just what priest made. So this eventually reversed the orientation of the cross sign.

this was just my assumption. Dear Byzantine Christians, please correct me if I'm wrong and explain what the act of making a cross sign symbolises in your tradition. And to  Oriental Christians, can you confirm if you're also making the cross in the same manner as Indians and Syrians?",OrthodoxChristianity

"During the Descent into Hades, was it Christ's soul that descended?",Balsamic_Door,1615256059,"I'm reading *Christ the Conqueror of Hell* (pg 52-53) by Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev, and there is a point of whether the soul or the Logos descended into hell. At Christ's death, did not Christ's soul depart from His body? And was it not Christ's soul that entered into Hades? What is Athanasius arguing here?

\_\_\_

Apart from the Arians, those opposed to Athanasius claimed that the Divine Logos was transformed into flesh at the incarnation. Arguing against this view, Athanasius speaks of the descent of the Logos into hell:

&gt;*This Body it was that was laid in a grave, when the Word had left it, yet was not parted from it, to preach, as Peter says, also to the spirits in prison. And this above all shows the foolishness of those who say that the Word was changed into bones and flesh. For if this had been so, then there would have been no need of a tomb. For the body would have gone by itself to preach to the spirits in Hades. But as it was, he himself went to preach, while Joseph wrapped the body in a linen cloth and laid it away at Golgotha. And so it is shown to all that the body was not the Word, but the body of the Word.*

As A. Grillmeier mentions, nowhere in \[Athanasius'\] authentic writings does Athanasius speak of the descent of Christ's soul into Hades while his body remained in the tomb; the question is always about the descent of the Divine Logos. However, in an apparently non-authentic writing ascribed to Athanasius, directed against the teachings of Apollinarius, the question is precisely about the descent of Christ's soul into Hades: 

&gt;*""The divinity \[of Christ\] neither left his body in the tomb nor separated itself from his soul in Hades... The realm of death was destroyed and the resurrection from hades was accomplished and preached to souls by God's soul, while corruption was abolished and incorruption was shown from the tomb by Christ's body.*",OrthodoxChristianity

On excessive despair after having sinned,feeble_stirrings,1614836948,"‚ÄúSome may think that they do not rely upon themselves and that they place all of their hope in God. But when they fall into some sort of sin, they despair and come into a melancholy and dismal state of soul. This excessive, dismal sorrow is a sign that they hoped not in God but in themselves, and therefore this betrayal of their self-assurance through their fall is particularly difficult and torturous, and it brings them into despair. But the one who does not rely upon himself, upon his own powers, will not be particularly surprised by a fall and will not be overwhelmed with excessive sorrow; he knows and understands that this happened because of his weakness and that nothing good can be expected of him. Such a man humbly admits his weakness, his helplessness, and, therefore, instead of giving himself over to extreme sorrow, he hastens to God, pouring out in prayer before Him his repentant feelings, hastens to repent before God of his sin as soon as possible, with his whole heart, and to continue to battle with unseen enemies and with the evil living in his soul‚Äîhe hastens into unseen warfare. It is necessary to thoroughly comprehend and remember that extreme listlessness and despondency after a sin befall one as a result of pride, of excessive hope in one‚Äôs own powers. When this hope is dashed, this is extremely painful for one‚Äôs pride, and provokes inconsolable sorrow for which there is no place when man puts all of his hope entirely upon God and not upon his own power.‚Äù

Which Orthodox Church best aligns with my tradition?,InjunJ03,1614808898,"My wife and I wanted to attend a vespers at an Orthodox Church. We are currently Byzantine Catholic in the Ruthenian church.

Is there a way to burn incense without charcoal?,bitnil,1614782330,"Hi everyone,

So question is in the title. Asking because non essential shops are closed due to restrictions, and all shops that sell charcoal where I live happen to be non essential. Mostly church shops which are inside the churches, and a couple other shops connected which are non essential. Also the shisha bars are closed so I can't get from them either.

I could get BBQ charcoal, but that isn't the same or even similar. There is also a non Orthodox way I know, which involves burning the incense over a small fire on chips of wood, but that's too messy and cumbersome, also I have asthma so the wood smoke isn't great.

Anyone got ideas? Is there another way to used incense that I don't know? Thanks!

(Sexual) Confessional Posts?,Chaiphet,1614779630,"Since joining this sub, I've noticed there's a steady stream of confessional posts.  Almost always written by men, of a sexual nature (i.e. I can't stop masturbating), their profiles are mere hours old, and often cross posted on multiple Christian subs.

The optimist in me would think that these are sincerely written by [Orthodox?] men who consider these things problems and are too shy to talk to their priest about it.  So shy they create burner reddit profiles to tell us about it.  Perhaps they view this as a dress rehearsal to build up enough courage to talk with their priest.  Perhaps they also genuinely hope our prayers and counsel will help them.

The pessimist in me would think these are softcore ways to get their exhibitionist jollies off.  

What to do about it, if anything?  

In the case of the former, optimistic perspective I think the best course of action for these folks is to talk with their priest directly, and not the abyss of social media.  Or if social media is a starting point / safe space, go back and read older posts on the subject from established members of the community (i.e. those whose profiles are &gt; 1 hour old).  

In the case of the latter, i think they're being inappropriate for this sub.  

I'm not psychic, so I can't ever know which variety the author is.  But I think either approach merits the same solution: stop barking up the wrong tree.  That is, institute a minimum karma and/or minimum profile age requirement for posts.  A sort of internet chatechumenate üôÇ That way, no one's being prevented from posting on the topic in the long run.  Just a safeguard to improve the thoughtfulness of posts and minimize the risk of exhibitionism.

Perhaps that seems self-righteous, but I'm honestly trying to be compassionate to folks from either camp.  If they have a problem, is the best solution to post anonymously and repeatedly to social media?  I don't think so.

I'm only human, so I could be way off on all of the above.  But I've seen these posts and my internet intuition has always been giving them the side-eye.  Surely, I can't be the only one?  What do you think?",OrthodoxChristianity

I‚Äôve been a long term lurker on this sub for a while now, and viewing the content here has been a part of my journey to the Church.

I‚Äôve always found this odd as it involves lying to children, but I know most people do it with good intention.

What is the nature of apologetics in light of the essence/energy distinction?,inordinately-confuse,1614487335,"A lot of orthodox sources seem to take an ambivalent if not outright hostile attitude to Christian apologetics, but isn‚Äôt it apologetics when we try to convince protestants, for example, to become orthodox by appealing to this or that fact about the early church? And why couldn‚Äôt this be beneficial to us as orthodox Christians to have reasons and evidence for why we are orthodox and not Protestant after we have come to the truth when it has been experientially revealed to us?

Wouldn‚Äôt philosophical arguments be necessary in this day and age to convince an atheist?

Now, patristics probably won‚Äôt contain much in the way of philosophical argument, but I heard about Augustine‚Äôs proof of God‚Äôs existence. What seems to me to be very important in understanding the nature of orthodox apologetics is the essence/energies distinction. In the Christian west, they can make use of philosophical apologetics since God‚Äôs essence can be know through reason. For example, Catholicism holds God to be fully known to exist through reason alone, but if I‚Äôm understanding the essence energies distinction correctly it would seem that knowledge of God can only come through interactions with his energies. This seems to imply that we cannot know God through reason, since this would not be experiencing God through his energies. Does this make philosophical arguments for God useless at best and spiritually dangerous at worst?

What are the implications of this for apologetics?

It seems that since we can know God only through his energies any apologetics ought to be focused around defending God‚Äôs existence indirectly through how God interacts with the world (ie a reasonable defence of Christianity may focus on defending miracles ie the resurrection as opposed of philosophical argumentation for God‚Äôs existence).

Can this apologetic approach still make use of reason? It seems like it can since St. Gregory of Palama‚Äôs used the Socratic method, which sort of requires using reason. Is it all about understanding the place of reason (ie not in defending God‚Äôs essence, but rather his energies since his essence remains unknowable)?",OrthodoxChristianity

"New catechumen, torn on EO vs OO",MariahKitty,1614465773,"Now that I've found a priest (Antiochian) to guide me through Orthodox catechism, I'm beginning to have doubts.

I feel way more drawn to OO churches, maybe due to culture and history, yet I want to be part of the one true church. This is why I attend EO liturgy.

I feel like average EO or OO Christians share the same religious beliefs. When I talk to devout EO Christians after church, they don't really know about the reason for the split or the natures of Christ. To my very limited knowledge, it's not emphasized in liturgy or practices, aside from putting two fingers down when we make the sign of the cross. Please correct me as I'm sure I'm wrong about a lot of this. How would my soul be in danger for communing with OOs? I really need this explained in, well, layman's terms. Fwiw, I believe in two natures. This understanding came to me in prayer. 

Even with these doubts, I do not want to forgo my EO catechism and instead be baptized OO. No, I guess I just wish they were united. Maybe I should visit American Coptic churches before making up my mind.

I hope this can help others as well. It‚Äôs one of those things you read that punches you right in the face. And I sure needed it. Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me. 


‚ÄúHow Many Times Have I Promised,
Yet Every Time I Failed to Keep My Word. But Disregard This According to Your Grace.""

Grant forgiveness, O Lord, send also strength. Convert me that I might live in sanctity, according to Your holy will. Sanctify my heart that has become a den and dwelling-place of demons.

I am unworthy to ask forgiveness for myself, O Lord, for many times have I promised to repent and proved myself a liar by not fulfilling my promise. You have picked me up many times already, but every time I freely chose to fall again.

Therefore I condemn myself and admit that I deserve all manner of punishment and torture. How many times have You enlightened my darkened mind; yet every time I return again to my evil thoughts! My whole body trembles when I contemplate on this; yet every time sinful sensuality re-conquers me.

How shall I recount all the gifts of Your grace, O Lord, that I the pitiful one have received? Yet I have reduced them all to nothing by my lack of concern, and I continue on in this manner. You have bestowed upon me thousands of gifts, yet miserable me, I offer in return things repulsive to you.

Yet You, O Lord, inasmuch as You contain a sea of longsuffering and an abyss of kindness, do not allow me to be felled as a fruitless fig tree; and do not let me be burned without having ripened on the field of life. Snatch me not away unprepared; seize not me for I have not yet lit my lamp; take not away me who has no wedding garment; but, because You are good and the lover of mankind, have mercy on me. Give me time to repent, and place not my soul stripped naked before Your terrible and unwavering throne as a pitiful spectacle of infamy.

If a righteous man can barely be saved, then where will I end up, I who am lawless and sinful? If the path that leads to life is straight and narrow, then how can I be guaranteed of such good things, I who live a life of luxury, indulging in my own pleasures and indulgences?

The grass is always greener on the other side,PsychologicalPark227,1614460259,"I was born Orthodox but it wasn't until about four years ago that I really fell in love with my faith. I went to all the services I read online articles, blogs, patristic works and theology books. I went on pilgrimages and developed my own rule of prayer, I even dreamed of being a priest. I had faith faith in God and faith in the church. Most of that is gone now.

During the last couple months I began doubting the church, I began wondering if perhaps I was wrong. I've never took Protestantism seriously but now I'm starting to. I don't buy ideas of sola scriptura or justification or iconoclasm or really most landmarks of Evangelical theology. What I do think however is perhaps not all of the Orthodox practices are truly apostolic. Sure alot of our stuff is old very very old I would say Orthodoxy is roughly the same as it was in the 4rth century. Still 300 years is a lot of time for change and I simply don't see the Orthodox church as the same as the early church. Yes it  is a continuation but not identical. When  I look to the early church I see anarchy, theological disagreements at every term, loose philisophical language and divergent liturgical practices and customs. I do not see the unity of Orthodoxy which we have today. It seems alot of our traditions are just the traditions which beat out equally old traditions. Most like the sign of the cross and chrism may date only to the 2nd to 3rd century.

&amp;#x200B;

When defending the historicity of Orthodox practices like praying to saints, or icons or a host of all other things I feel like I'm making arguments similar to Catholics who claim that the Papacy is a divine institution.

Catholic question about married clergy,Alistairdad,1614400927,"Catholic Question for my Orthobros

Blessed Lent!

As a Roman catholic, the idea of a married priesthood is very interesting to me. I wonder if there is any kind of established precedences in place for how a married priest with children is to juggle his two vocations. 

A scenario which bothers me to no end: 
Do you are a priest at the parish. You are married, to wonderful woman, who has given you four children. Unfortunately, one of your children has fallen deathly ill. While you are tending to your familial affairs keeping watch with your family and your sick child, you receive a call that a child in the parish is in a similar situation at an entirely different hospital. Would the married priest be expected/obliged to leave his family, including his sickly child, in order to administer the mysteries to this other child, to whom he has an obligation to provide spiritual care for?

Advice during conversion,OrthoCurious123,1614396581,"My wife and I recently decided to convert from ""traditional"" Roman Catholicism to Orthodoxy. I'm sure some of you are familiar with this, but in ""traditional"" Catholicism it is taught almost explicitly that anyone outside of the visible unity of the Catholic Church and directly submissive to the pope will almost certainly suffer the hell fire. (Of course, meanwhile they implicitly deny the Supreme authority they insist the pope commands by refusing to subscribe to whatever of his teachings with which they disagree, but that's a separate story.) We have already told some of our friends from our previous parish that we have made this decision. At first, they agreed to be understanding... then this morning I got a text message along the lines ""they don't believe in the Immaculate Conception, Our Lady of Fatima told us to pray the rosary and they don't even have the rosary, they don't believe in the Eucharist being the body and blood and you should talk to our priest."" I can almost see them hunched over a keyboard doing a search of ""Catholic Answers"" for some quick drive-by snipes. Well bless their heart, it's wonderful that they don't want me burning in hell, but I've already expressed that I'm not leaving Catholicism because I'm frustrated with it or something so mundane, but that I believe the Orthodox communion to be the true Church of the apostles. How do I let them know that I am as certain of the Church I am joining as they are of the church I am leaving. If I have to break some friendships to avoid having my faith put through the wringer at the cost of cheap, slanderous polemics, I will. But I would appreciate if anyone has advice on how I can address this issue with my former parishioners peaceably.

Bible quotes against veneration of saints,PsychologicalPark227,1614391510,"I just stumbled upon a bible verse which seems like a pretty damning rebuttal of Orthodox dogma considering saints. 

 ""So I fell at his feet to worship him. But he told me, ""Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who rely on the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy "" Rev 19:10 

Now I know the common response that there is a difference between latria and dulia. The verb used here is proskynesis which is not latria and most times I think it falls under dulia. Still the angel rebukes him for this and tells him to worship God instead. This is odd St John is not doing much rather just showing reverence, in many other places in scripture we see others make proskenysis  to angels and even to men. I doubt that St John was so spiritually blind to confuse the angel with God and to offer him latria. There is nothing to indicate that here St John is not just venerating the angel. The Angel's argument is identical to the protestant one leveled against us today that instead of reverencing created things we should venerate God. This same seen happens another time in Rev 22 again showing that it seems to be an important point. I can find no patristic exegesis to help interpret this scene and its been giving me alot of trouble. I have no theological reasons against the veneration of saints just historical. Some passages in the gospels seem against it and in addition we have no evidence of veneration of anyone but God until roughly the early 3rd century ( One could maybe count the gospel of Hermas however the angel being venerated very likely could be Christ and in addition it may not be a fully orthodox text)

Now perhaps I must just trust in tradition which I wish I could however the amount of veneration we see in the third century seems almost unnaturally abrupt. If veneration was a part of the early church it must have been very quiet and toned down compared to later practice. Now I am not arguing against praying with the saints for example ""through the prayers of our holy fathers our lord jesus Christ and all the saints have mercy on us"" or even "" Through the prayers of the Theotokos savior save us"" compared against a direct appeal only to a saint like "" Most Holy theotokos save us""

I just can't see St John who was scolded for just venerating an angel being able to sing "" Most holy theotokos save us""",OrthodoxChristianity

Having faith seems suspicious to me.,Kostas92Ftw,1614327332," There many religions besides CHristianity and there are other texts too. Why Christianity is the right religion and its texts are really the word of God?

 People can be deluded easily. Look politics for example. What if some people lied that the texts are the word of God in order to bring some order in the world? I guess that age, people were more easily deluded. So, some people with their texts, bring hope (heaven) and fear (hell). Many people believe that so, religion is created. Through years and tradition Christianity is spread.  

 What if Christianity is a man-made religion? Also, faith does not make sense to me. Faith means to believe something/someone. Its natural for people to choose NOT to believe not because its more convenient but because they ended up choosing not to believe for different reasons.

 For example, people from other religions really believe to other Gods and they are not doing it from pride. They just, really think that their religion/Gods are real!  Can you blame them for keeping their religion? NO! If an other GOd was real, would you blame yourself for being a Christian? nO! Thats the same with people who belong to other religions. So, I reach to the conclusion that having faith requires some luck and its natural for some people to believe to Jesus and some others not to.

 So, if it is natural for someone to choose not to have faith in Jesus then, I cant understand why that man deserves hell for not believing. To me maybe it seems as if Chrisitan God has allowed many paths (religions) but only one leads to heaven. But, to choose the right path(faith) requires some luck or something. Well, that does not make sense to me. The future of the soul is based on faith and somehow on luck?

Some Christians are like "" Christian God is the real God because He is"". I read messages from Muslims who told me that Allah is the real God. They really believed that like a Christian does. So, I cant blame anyone who rejects Jesus. Everyone thinks their God/Gods is the real one. I even read about a woman who I think had something like a vision and saw a Hindu God. I cant blame her for her beliefs becoming stronger after what she saw. So, my question is how Christian God expect us to have faith in Him when there are many traps/religions/delusions in these life? 

 I am not sure if this can be answered. To me it just, does not make sense. Thats why I lost my faith. Threating people that do not have faith seems really suspicious to me. Many Christians believe to Jesus because they were taught from kids to do that. They get influenced by seeing many people (young and old) to believe in Jesus. That and the fear of hell forces them to believe to Jesus. What if Christianity is just a false religion that became  a tradition and caused brainwashing to people?",OrthodoxChristianity

Ever virginity of Mary,Vasilisonofspiro,1614316350,"I‚Äôve had trouble with the doctrine of recent, it most likely comes from my innate skepticism but I just can‚Äôt wrap my hand around this doctrine. 

First I will say my doubts about it do not come from the mention of Jesus‚Äô brothers. I believe that it‚Äôs most likely they were from a previous marriage of Joseph. ( I read a fascinating paper by Richard bauckham who despite not believing in the perpetual virginity of Mary believes that it‚Äôs fairly likely that Jesus‚Äô brothers were from another marriage ). 

My main concern is that in second temple Judaism marriage was intrinsically linked with consummation and later marital relations. I also for various reasons find the idea that the Virgin Mary was a temple virgin unlikely. I believe such a group definitely existed and that the protoevangelium describes them more or less correctly but If Luke or any other church father like Irenaeus knew of such a tradition they would mention it since it sheds so much light on Mary‚Äôs purity and why she was chosen ( I would say it‚Äôs a more important story than the conception of John the Baptist which Luke adds in his gospel)
It‚Äôs absence is just so jarring to me not just from Luke but also from St Irenaeus ( who seemed to deny perpetual virginity ) 

This is probably a very minor issue to have and perhaps I just need to trust the church better but if anyone can point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.

The Relationship Between This Subreddit and Fasting,AutoModerator,1614288526,"As Great Lent approaches, the subreddit often gets many questions related to the fast. Mostly these questions come in the form of inquiring about the rules. Visitors and members of this subreddit should keep in mind that the rules one finds in the books are the strictest versions of the fast rather than the ones most common in practice. Given that participants here are not the spiritual directors of other participants, the only advice we can provide is to quote the book and maybe anecdotes about various particular relaxations.

*No participant here should treat advice on fasting here as binding*. A penitent's fast is between themselves, their confessor, and God. Advice on fasting should come from a spiritual director familiar with a penitent's particular situation. The subreddit can in no wise assist in that process other than to suggesting that one seek out a flesh and blood guide.

All of that said, here are two links on the matter of fasting. The first addresses fasting for non-monastics, the second is a strict by-the-book rule on fasting. Different traditions have different 'standard' fasting rules, so this is not *the* Orthodox rule book and your calendar may differ from the link provided. *This link is not provided as a recommendation for your fast, but as reference material.*

Please pray for me,orthothom,1614257914,"I am going through a rough transition in my life right now. I'll try to paint a picture of what's happening.

I've left university for what appears to be the third time (I've honestly lost track) and I am probably going to go back anyway because I really need to finish my degree. And I don't have a job, nor do I know how to get one. So I am basically spending my days doing nothing, unless pacing around, ruminating and waxing philosophical count as productive activities. The lack of routine has made my mental health so bad that it is beginning to have a physical toll as well. And yet I am utterly clueless on how to get myself out of this rut. The only things that give me a semblance of happiness are food and video games.

In the past few months I have learned that I am almost certainly on the autism spectrum. I have scheduled a psychological evaluation to potentially be diagnosed, but it isn't for another two months. It is nice to know that there is a name for what I have experienced for my whole life, but it is also disparaging because I know that I can never be a ""normal"" person, which makes my depression and anxiety even worse.

I have felt like becoming Orthodox, but now I am questioning my intentions. I became a Roman Catholic last year from a background of sheer agnosticism. But I feel like I only did it for the aesthetics and the feelings of unearned self-righteousness. And now I have become fed up with Roman Catholicism (especially the parts about being ashamed for having sexual thoughts and feelings). I have become more interested in Orthodoxy, especially after doing a lot of research on the history behind the East-West Schism. However, I don't want to become Orthodox for the wrong reasons, i.e. because I am traditional/conservative and want to come off as self-righteous. I want seek truth, and yet my prayer life has been in the gutter.

I am having really bad trust issues. I tend to lash out at anyone who even slightly disagrees with me on the most trivial topics. And unfortunately these people that I lash out at tend to be my blood relatives, even though I know they love me and want to understand me. It is just that they don't take too kindly to religion and are much more politically progressive/socialist, while I am much more traditional and concerned with the hereafter. They are also very paranoid about the Virus, while I have become fatalistic about it and could not care less about wearing a stupid, useless mask.

On top of all of this, I have felt this overwhelming sense of dread and despair. I have wasted so much of my potential, and I have practically done nothing since I graduated from high school five years ago (I am now 22 years old). I have only developed a semblance of social skills, and my social networks seem to be collapsing all around me. And I feel like a loser because I have never kissed a girl, nor am I in any position to meet someone to start dating. I know that sounds juvenile and pathetic, but it is causing me more angst than it should. There have been many thoughts of suicide passing through my mind, and sometimes I feel like that is my only option.

So I guess I am turning to this subreddit. I'm not sure how much the power of prayer could help me, but I am putting my trust in the prayers of the Church that Jesus and His Apostles founded 2000 years ago. If you could please pray for me, I would appreciate it. I know this is a lot to read, but thank you for reading it anyway.",OrthodoxChristianity

How much do I say to a priest?,rocketboomboom,1614236340,"Hello,

I've been orthodox roughly four years now. I'm still new. I'm struggling at having church boundaries if those exist. Does that make sense? My background doesn't help me trust people that easily. I also have some emotional problems that makes life hard. I'd like to be able to talk to my priest about my problems but I don't know how much or too little to say. In confession, I'm at a loss at what to say sometimes besides what I have written down on paper. In monasticism, one is suppose to tell their spiritual father EVERYTHING! I really don't think this happens in the world. I really don't know what a relationship with a spiritual father should look like. The priest who christmated me recently retired due to health reasons so I don't want to bother him. It took a long time to get used to a point where I could call him when I was upset but this new person I'm confessing to doesn't seem to be like that. What am I do to?

Father Stephen De Young‚Äôs comments on political converts,beldadosselamawit,1614212024,"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a high church Protestant, and your denomination starts ordaining women, and that‚Äôs the only reason you‚Äôre interested in joining the Orthodox Church, if they had never started ordaining women, you would have happily stayed there your entire life, you should not become Orthodox. Because that‚Äôs not a reason.

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs causing, frankly, a crisis in the American Orthodox Church, that we have a lot of people, Russifiles, Putinstans (?), they‚Äôre just on the political right, so they‚Äôre attracted to things that are traditional. And whatever church they were in, if any, ordained women, or took some [un?]Biblical stance on homosexuality, and so they want to be in the traditional place!

‚ÄúAnd, that‚Äôs not only unhealthy for them, because when we bring someone into the Orthodox Church, we‚Äôre bringing them into the direct pretense of Christ. We‚Äôre giving them the Eucharist. If we‚Äôre bringing people in who are in a state where they‚Äôre not able to receive that, we‚Äôre damaging them. We‚Äôre harming them. We could be killing them.

‚ÄúSo, out of compassion for them we shouldn‚Äôt be doing it, and out of love for the Church we shouldn‚Äôt be doing it. Because that‚Äôs bringing strife and division into the the Church, into our parishes.

‚ÄúSo, yeah, we have a problem with that, of people loving traditionalism, as such, coming from a very right-wing point of view where that‚Äôs appealing. That‚Äôs a really bad reason for someone to join the Church.

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not saying we should put up a sign and throw people out and tell people go away. But I‚Äôm saying that catechesis is not about teaching a body of knowledge. That‚Äôs not what Orthodoxy is. Catechesis is about bringing people into the Orthodox way of life, in calling people who are trying to join for the wrong reasons to repentance and get them to join for the right reasons.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt want these people to join at all. We don‚Äôt want them to join for the wrong reasons and bring what is really, ultimately sin with them.‚Äù

The idea of sin being an offense against God, and the necessity of paying a penalty in order to cover it, comes from Augustine. The Filioque comes from Augustine. Using human reasoning to interpret eternal truths comes mainly from Augustine. John Calvin was heavily influenced by Augustine. Much of western Christianity, errors and all, is based on Augustine's theological views, and western Christianity is divided to an extreme degree.

Does the church recognize Augustine's sainthood because of his lifelong struggle against sin, and less because of his teachings? And if his teachings contained so many errors, why is he recognized as a church father?

Hi all, as evolution becomes more and more prevalent in society and school I was wondering how this fits in with our faith. I browsed many orthodox forums and read many blogs (which have only strengthened my faith!) but there is one big outlier nobody seems to mention, the fossil record. How do we explain the bones and fossils of ""past human species?"" To be honest it puzzles me and I can't seem to figure it out. Past animals like dinosaurs have better explanations like the flood wiped them out, or during creation God let nature run its course until the earth was ready for man.",OrthodoxChristianity

"For those of you former Roman Catholics, how do you handle family dynamics/ ‚Äútraditions‚Äù when they overlap with faith?",ruddieduck,1614011328,"Hello. My husband and I are both currently converting to Orthodoxy. We‚Äôre about a year into our journey and have regularly been attending an Orthodox Church/meeting with our priest. 

I come from an Irish Roman Catholic family and was baptized Catholic. I made my first confession but shortly after that my parents stopped attending church. Every couple years or so our grandparents would take us, but outside of being told by our parents we were Catholic, there was no spiritual aspect of our lives. Fast forward to last year, when my husband and I got married. We were married in the Catholic Church because technically we were both Catholic, although we felt conflicted at the time. Very shortly after we discovered Orthodoxy and it‚Äôs been the most fulfilling and exciting thing to happen in our lives. I mentioned to my parents that I was converting around Christmas time and they mostly brushed it off. I didn‚Äôt get too much into it because I figured A- it‚Äôs none of their business really and B- they don‚Äôt ever go to church so I don‚Äôt see why they‚Äôd have an issue with it

Fast forward again to the beginning of January. My mom approaches me and says that my brother wants to name my husband and I the godparents of his soon-to-be born baby. My initial wave of excitement quickly gave way to a feeling of dread. How can I be a Catholic godparent if I am no longer Catholic and don‚Äôt believe in it? I spoke with my brother on the phone and got a lot of ‚Äúoh just say you still are it doesn‚Äôt matter they can‚Äôt prove you aren‚Äôt‚Äù etc. I spoke with my priest as well and he counseled against it due to complications that can arise down the road. Before I even spoke with him though I had already realized it wasn‚Äôt something I was going to be able to do. I am not Catholic anymore and can not promise to raise their child Catholic. I can‚Äôt understand just saying ‚Äúoh it doesn‚Äôt really matter‚Äù. 

I told my brother that we‚Äôd love to be the godparents in every sense outside of the religious ceremony aspect. I feel like it‚Äôs pretty cut and dry. However, my family simply can not understand. My brother doesn‚Äôt seem to be speaking to me and my mom has been telling me that I‚Äôm being ridiculous because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a tradition‚Äù.. but isn‚Äôt it more than that? Am I wrong here? Why am I, the no longer Catholic, showing more respect to the Catholic religion than these people who supposedly are? And why is it that these people can have absolutely no involvement in church life for decades and all of a sudden I‚Äôm the bad guy? I feel like they‚Äôre trying to tear my new joy away from me.

I understand that it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúbig deal‚Äù to them but then why even do a baptism at all? It‚Äôs not like they will ever bring that child to church. And it‚Äôs a very big deal to me. The last thing I ever want to do is hurt my brother, but I feel like there‚Äôs no respect for me in this situation. I don‚Äôt want to have to endure this severe ethical dilemma over what is to them basically just a glorified family photo op. 

I understand that this is long and rambling and I apologize, but have any of you been through something similar? How did you get your family to respect you? Religion was never an aspect of our family‚Äôs life AT ALL and now, as soon as I find Orthodoxy it‚Äôs suddenly a big deal to them. I guess it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôm having to actually face the fact that I‚Äôm cutting ties with my past ‚Äúidentity‚Äù as thin as they were and I‚Äôm really struggling. I absolutely hate being a disappointment.

Advice on rude/rambunctious kids in church,possum4ever,1614008115,"My parish is relatively small (especially these days) but there are two families (one is the priest's family) with lots of young children. When only one family is present for liturgy, the kids are generally ok but two families with wild kids really feed off each other during liturgy and it has become increasingly noisy (screaming, running around) and disruptive (kids running and bumping into me in the pew and hall, banging on the pew, running to the front of the temple and having a parent chase them). I have a lot of sensory issues, and repetitive noises, as well as kids coming up to touch my things and bump into me when I'm trying to pray has made the last few liturgies really really difficult. I'm all for children being in the liturgy, Jesus wanted that, but there's a point where it is disrespectful to fellow parishioners and doing a disservice to the children who are very obviously not being disciplined (the parents don't discipline their children and rarely remove them from the temple when they misbehave). 

Is there a way I can bring this issue to the priest? Are there any writings from church fathers about children (that I could share beyond my own experiences, and the agreement of other parishioners)? It's especially complicated because his children contribute to the issue, he's a  young and relatively new/inexperienced priest, and does not handle different views well. But as Lent begins, I'm very torn about attending services. Yesterday, one child somehow acquired a prayer candle (glass) and shattered it during the creed. Obviously an accident, but yikes.

I just don't know....,athlon3264,1613972279," 

I really dont know how to start this letter. I really dont know what I am or who I am. All I know is that I am as far from normal as can be. I started to remember when the COVID pandemic began ‚Ä¶ I slowly started to remember things that they had blocked and I realized the horror that is my life. Most of the things that I write will be hard to believe but please please don‚Äôt insult me by saying that I am deranged or that I need to go to a doctor‚Ä¶.

I was born in Ethiopia a country know for its deeply rooted orthodox christianity. I know live in the United States of America. I am 31 years old and in the year of 2020 everything.

I thought that I was as normal as normal can be‚Ä¶ but I now since I have been able to remember certain incidents that were blocked by my ‚Äúfamily and friends‚Äù that has forced me to face the harsh reality that I have no family or friends. 

There have been certain incidents in my life of abuse that my family and the immediate people around me performed on me that I was made to forget. All of them use to beat me up frequently and when I asked them what the reason was they told me that they were demons. Actual literal demons. My family use to knock me out and they use to tell me they were demons and that the end of the world is soon at hand. They use to tell me that I was suppose to be some sort of King during the era of peace which is to come when the devil would be chained. I didn‚Äôt understand any of this. Then they made me forget and know after a very long time‚Ä¶ I finally remember it all. Everyone around me ‚Ä¶ everyone in my family, everyone in my school, college, workplace use to beat me up ‚Ä¶ when I called the cops they would laugh at me and refer me by name and tell me that I would suffer. They use to tell me that they were demons. They use to ask me where I was going to put them heaven or hell‚Ä¶ when I told them heaven, they use to beat me up until I told them hell. They told me God would give me authority over them and decide where I would send them. My own family.. And they made me forget everything ‚Ä¶ they told me that they would make me forget and that I would remember it later in my life and now it has all come back. Even my father of confession use to beat me up and tell me that he was a demon and torture me to say that I would send him to hell. Everyone in church use to beat me up as well. They use to come to my dorm room and beat me up. Priests have told me to kill myself.

There is a prophecy in catholicism and orthodoxy that there will be a great war and after the war there would be an era of peace and happiness where Christ would be enthroned in our hearts. The prophecy in Ethiopia speaks about how Christianiy and holiness will spread to the ends of the world and that since the devil would be chained REV:20, there would be no more evil until he were to be released again and after that would be Christ‚Äôs coming.

Greetings from a heretic,Jimmy_the_grinder,1613824205,"Hello! Sorry for the long post. To explain the title, I was born and raised in the protestant church, and I have heard at least Catholics view that branch of Christianity in a negative light. Anyway, after 20 years of building my foundation in my faith, I started to critically look at what I have been taught at the various churches as well as how my protestant brothers and sisters acted and spoke about eachother. Dont get me wrong, I believe most of the fundamental teachings of protestantism are based in truth, but I am absolutely appalled by how the individual denominations act toward eachother, and even how individual Christians I know treating eachother. I have done some surface level research into both Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy (more so the former), and I find a lot of the teachings that were left out of protestantism MAKE SENSE to me. I am still confused on what the differences between the two churches, and even how different they are now that many of the eastern churches have reestablished communion with Rome. Could someone explain the differences to me and why they are significant? Bonus points if you can explain it to me like you might to a 5 year old, since I am still in the phase where I get overwhelmed and confused by the jargon that's familiar to those of you already in those churches.

"A very long reflection on Christianity, the Eastern religions and the modern times",OriginalSeam,1613822490,"I'm a Catholic, but am writing this here because I am circling a possible conversion to Orthodoxy.

Just ten years ago, atheism was on the verge. As a teenager back then, it seemed that more and more people were disinterested about any kind religion. Nowadays the situation is changed. There is a sort of return to ""spirituality"". Many would agree that there is more to understand about our existence than what a materialistic paradigm would suggest, but instead of searching their answers in Christ, they turn to, quite literally, everything: even paganism! I myself know a neo-pagan.  But the more enticing religion are still the Eastern ones, the idea of them that reached easily the West.

Now, Orthodoxy. Orthodoxy is a strange ""beast"" for people who grew up as modern Catholic (post Vatican II) and an alien ""beast"" for Protestants. We Catholic have almost severed our ties with mysticism, monasticism, etc. Since that Council, we have swerved more to the Protestant side in terms of how a Christian life is to be lived. So, Orthodoxy appears as a compromise that entice many modern disenchanted people: a strong mystical component, all the ritualistic ""trappings"" of the Eastern religions, a style that set the Church apart from any other form of Christianity. Or so it seems, at least. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here the incompatibility part, the crux of this (sorry) long thread. I myself, before reverting to Christianity, I dabbed in the Oriental big religions, Buddhism and Hinduism (the endlessly varied form of Hinduism). The more I was into it, the more I understood where the radical incompatibility was. 

In Buddhism, the whole point is to break free from sufferance, and the delusions that accompany suffering. But it's not what many think of it in the West when they look at the smiling statues of the Buddha and say, ""how nice, how peaceful in contrast to the cross of Christ!"". In Buddhism, the main delusion it the conviction that there is a self, an individual person. But you do not really exist, just appear to do so. Desires and delusions keep this illusion alive. There are many ways to conceptualize Nirvana, but one thing is certain: you won't be there, because in a strict sense you are not here even now. ""Nirvana"" was the term used to describe a quenched fire. 

In Hinduism, the situation is on the surface better for a Christian. There is Brahman, the ground of existence from whence everything spring forth, the unconditioned, the uncaused cause. Basically, it's God. Brahman can't be described, only experienced. It's outside space, time, matter, etc. And there is a inner self (atman) in us, what we call ""soul"". Yet, in most Hindu philosophies, this inner self is not distinct. It's the same for every being. They go so far as to say that we are God who delude himself to be a distinct Ego. So, you actual person is still a limitation. The goal is to get reabsorbed into Brahman: forget your actual person you think you are. Now, Hinduism of this sort has a striking parallel in Western history: Platonism in its later development. Plotinus could have been a disciple of the Vedas.

So, one say. Look at the Orthodox Church. They talk of ""Theosis"" as a goal, they basically meditate and use mantras, their spiritual core is monastic life, etc. It's more or less the same! **No.** The ground of Christianity is that your self, your person, even your body, is not accidental. It possess a unique dignity. *It is you*. You are not an illusion: you are real, and free. Bounded by sin, but free. Even Theosis is not a dissolution but the highest form of communion. It's a gift from God, given to you. Suffering is not to be avoided, but embraced to the deepest end. Becoming like Christ does mean that you annihilate your identity: you transcend it, fulfil it. 

Now, when it is said that Christianity founded the Western world, it is that we refer to. The concept of ""individual"" is the firstfruit of the sacrifice of Christ. It is not philosophy, not religious practice: but the very idea that I exist, am unique, and am free. 

Now, when the Western world decided that he wanted to keep this profound sense of  individuality but get rid of the source of it, Christ as God, all our problem started. But can the answer be a return to pre-Christian ideas that you as you are just an accident, an illusion, or a piece of the All?",OrthodoxChristianity

Questions about the orthodox faith,gambleroflives91,1613808404,"Hello, I am from Romania, I am orthodox christian, I am not very religious, like, I don't practice my religion, nor am I from a religious background. But I do believe..I am a believer.

However, I believe a bit differently, I think...just want to make sure that my beliefs are in order.

I believe in one God, and I do have a relation with him...it's something personal, as I think it's something personal for everybody. However, Jesus was not really a big deal in my faith....like, don't get me wrong...I believe we've got salvation, this concept, of salvation, seems very revolutionary to me...I believe in Jesus teachings (the story of the prodigal son expresses my view of orthodoxy very well, this was kinda of a big deal for me, very insightfull, loved it).

When I say that Jesus is not a big deal for me in my faith, I kinda find it strange to pray to him. I never have...I only talk with the father, because I like that relationship.

Is this wrong ?

Secondly

How do we explain the holly trinity ? So, there is one God....the father, son and the holly spirit are God -  is the trinity a definition of what God is ?  I know that some things we don't know, or understand, it's beyond our understanding....In this context, what would be the best definition ?

Third

How do the catholics and protestants view the christian faith ? I believe that in orthodoxy, based on my background, we do focus more on the father-son relationship, rather than Jesus. Do they focus more on Jesus ? Like, kinda of a big brother relationship ? How do they view it ?

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to be honest, I kinda find taboo, the whole praying to Jesus thing. Because God, as I define him...it exceeds our imagination and understanding. So, it's weird to assign a picture to someone I can't even imagine :)...but maybe this is just me

Importance of physical beauty in Orthodoxy?,throwaway16MRC,1613702157,"Hi!

Well, the title may speak for itself, how important is physical beauty in dating according to EOC? 

I like a girl, we're indeed friends, when I go over to her house we talk for hours, she's kind (everytime I visit her she offers me coffee with bread, she's so cute tbh), everything goes smoothly, it seems that she trust me to the point of talking personal issues with me, even her mother is really friendly. 
I want to date my friend, the problem is... Well... I'm ugly. 

I never grew too much (5'6), and worst of all, I have acne scars all over my face (she has some acne too, but nowhere near as I do), and I'm sure the date girls wish for isn't a guy whose face looks like a place where tens of asteroids landed. 
Around her (and around most of the people) I never show this insecurity, I'm always happy, I'm smiling, I'm making jokes, but on the inside, this really bothers me.

19 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more. 20 And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 21 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. 22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. 23 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you. (1 Corinthians 9:19-23 ‚Äì American King James Version).

&amp;#x200B;

Paul, though not subject to the rules of those he describes in the passage, submitted to their rules, thus making himself their servant, so as to correct them from error.

Paul himself was a Jew, and he became as a Jew in order to correct the Jews, in the sense that he adapted to their rules. The Jews were those under the law. From Christ's sacrifice onward, men are not under the law but under grace (Romans 6:14). The law, before Christ's sacrifice, condemned any man not to inherit eternal life, for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23 ‚Äì American King James Version), but are justified freely by the grace of God through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus (Romans 3:24 ‚Äì American King James Version). Therefore, the law could not save people in that it was weak through the flesh (Romans 8:3 ‚Äì American King James Version). When people were under the law, before Christ's sacrifice, they were kept under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed (Galatians 3:23 ‚Äì American King James Version); they were under the curse (Galatians 3:10), because the law condemns all people to not be justified before God, since everyone has sinned in their lives, meaning that everyone (except Christ) failed to follow the law perfectly in their entire lives without ever having sinned.

Even in the old covenant people were justified by faith, for example Abraham (Romans 4:9); and the free grace of God, through the redemption that is in Christ, allows those people who died in faith (Hebrews 11.13) to inherit eternal life. But without Christ's sacrifice, as said before, no one could have inherited eternal life, and that is why there was a need for his sacrifice. The ""law"" is the revealed law of Moses (John 1:17).

The Jews of whom Paul speaks are those Jews who rejected Christ and did not adapt to the new covenant. They therefore remained under the law in the sense that they sought to be justified through the law, even following laws of the law that are now abolished, for example, circumcision (Galatians 5:3-6), etc. Just as did the Galatians who converted to Christ and wanted to be justified by the law, and so Christ became of no effect to them, they fallen from grace (Galatians 5:2-6); thus resulting under the law (Galatians 4:21) which condemned them. They resulted subject to the law.

Even though people are now under grace, in a sense they are subject to the law, because without the law there can be no sin (Romans 5:13), and sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4). The law of Moses also exists today and will exist forever (Luke 16:17). Today there are the laws that there are.

&amp;#x200B;

Those without law in verse 21 were those people who had not received the revealed law of Moses, as the Jews received it, but the law of Moses was written in their hearts (Romans 2:14-15). This is only the meaning of the phrase ""without law"". Paul adapted himself to these people in order to gain them. As the verse itself says, Paul was under the law, that is, the law to Christ. He was under the law that includes the laws that are in the new covenant.

&amp;#x200B;

In verse 22 the ""weak"" were those Christians who were weak in the faith (Romans 14:1) who did not have knowledge (1 Corinthians 8:7-13), that is, they thought they had to follow some rule that they really didn't have to follow, just because they did not have knowledge in regard. Paul adapted to the weak by following what they thought they had to follow.

Paul did all this for the sake of the gospel, in order to be a partaker thereof with others of what the gospel offers.",OrthodoxChristianity

Orthodoxy &amp; I...,Zealousideal-End2261,1613657637,"Hello.

Well, a little about me and my currents questionings.

I am catholic, but I have a great interest in orthodoxy. I left the Catholic Church for a while, for several factors, but I came back last year. My spirituality was reduced to nothing and my life was lost, my misery increased. And then I saw that without God life and suffering are meaningless. 

But the issues that have plagued me lately, has brought me close to orthodoxy these days. The church lives a crise. The novus ordo missae opened up a lot of space for liturgical abuse, it is little reverent. It hurts my heart to see these abuses. 

There is even influence of the pentecostal protestantism in some, like the CCR. They lead you away from the Truth. And that is the main question to me: the truth. As said in John (8, 31-32), ""If you make my word your home you¬†will¬†indeed be my disciples; you¬†will¬†come to know the truth, and the¬†truth¬†will¬†set you free"".

Some theological issues I have too: Papal primacy and infallibility, the filioque, the immaculate conception, the purgatory, essence-energy.

For me, orthodoxy carries with it an undeniable truth.  And in today's world, where values ‚Äã‚Äãdissipate so quickly, orthodoxy seems the only way.

When I was outside the church, a short biography of St. Silouan the Athonite was brought to me. That was my I first contact with orthodoxy. 

I live in Brazil, the closest orthodoxy church is about 2h30, it's not thar far. There are Antiochian, Russian, Greek and other churches around here. 

At the moment it seems appropriate to continue in prayer and studying, so that I can become more confident of which path follow. 

If anyone passed to something similar, I'd like to hear your experience. 

Pray for my discernment.

Help my unbelief,PsychologicalPark227,1613627061,"Hello I was wondering how do you all believe.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background I have been Orthodox my whole life and I know my basic theology. For me it all makes sense intellectually, the trinity, Christ's destruction of death, apostolic succession, saints and miracles. I can mentally assent to all of these things, I don't find any obvious contradictions intellectually, if anything Orthodoxy is the only religion that makes sense to me. Materialism is ridiculous, Protestantism ahistorical, I cannot get behind the cycles of reincarnation in the eastern religions, nor am I convinced of Judaism or Islam. 

&amp;#x200B;

Spiritually Orthodoxy  checks all the boxes for me. The liturgy is beautiful the practices are edifying and the theology translates into life perfectly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still struggle to believe. Mainly I have trouble basing my entire existence around the life of a Galilean peasant who lived two thousand years ago. Our whole religion lays in the balance of the historical life of a single man.  If history didn't go down as the Bibles said they did ( I dont mean that the Bibles are literally just if Christ wasn't born of a virgin, did not initiate the last supper, did breathe the Holy spirit onto the apostles and most importantly did not rise from the dead ) all we believe no matter how beautiful and wise our theology is is wrong. I myself am like Thomas as unless I the marks in his hands and put my fingers into the indents I will not believe. I try my hardest but I just can't too much rides on too little evidence. The fact is if even those who met the living Christ face to face did not believe ( Judas one of his own went so far as to betray him ) how can I.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the standard arguments about the apostles dying for their faith in the risen Christ and all other things concerning the reality of the resurrection. I find them somewhat convincing but not enough to build a religion out of. What convinces me most is the living Christ found today in the church in the lives of the saints however ever religion boasts holy men with miracles. 

I sometimes think that the only reason Christianity seems so true to me is because I really desperately want it to be true. I need a christ an all good and loving God. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still will try to believe as it is written in the Gospels "" Lord I believe help my unbelief"". Any comments are helpful however what will be most helpful are your prayers.

Convince me to become Orthodox,neighbor_vadim,1613622478,"Hello!

After much trepidation and figurative nail-biting, I have decided to post here.

My husband and I are both converts to Catholicism, and we sincerely wanted to believe we had found God's Church. However, over the past several months, my husband has become something of a hobby theologian and philosopher, and he's discovered what he believes are several irreconcilable contradictions and departures from tradition in Catholic teaching--the Filioque, the Pseudo-Isodorean decretals (and other similar forged sets of decretals), logical problems with absolute divine simplicity, canon 6 from the Council of Nicaea, and canon 28 from the Council of Chalcedon, to name a few. 

Based on what he has learned, he wants to either convert to Eastern Orthodoxy, or, should he find similar issues with Orthodox doctrine, return to agnosticism. He is still undecided on that front.

Perhaps I am a coward, but I am very hesitant to go down this road with him, and although I do not have the academic training to formulate the necessary pithy, long-winded logical proofs, I know in my heart that agnosticism would be the wrong choice; I know God is real, and He is the Christian God. 

Because I fear for my husband's soul, as well as my own, I decided to try to do my own digging on the topics my husband has contentions with. Considering the complexity of the information involved, I didn't trust my own rather meager training in apologetics and theology to get me through it all, so naturally, I contacted a priest. He didn't reply; in fact, he did not even acknowledge my request for help. So I tried another priest. And another. And another. And so on until I had contacted over a dozen different priests, with most refusing to acknowledge that I had even made contact, and the few who did acknowledge me turning every color of confused. 

When I did find the occasional individual who seemed to know something or another, it turned out that half of their ""information"" proving that the Catholic Church was correct on the issues was their own opinion and (flawed) reasoning, and it was actually a pretty large jump from their sources to their conclusions.

Now, I will take a moment to give a brief background on me. As I said before, I am a convert to Catholicism. Years ago, I was a dyed-in-the-wool Missouri Synod Lutheran, and one day, I debated a Catholic woman from Ireland. I went into the debate certain that I would win, and she would be a fool. It would be an understatement to say that didn't happen. I entered RCIA a few months later. The reason I say this is because if I realize I am wrong, then I will willingly jump ship and swim to wherever the truth is.

So, it's shaping up like I may have been wrong again--please offer whatever proof you have to convince me to become Orthodox. I'd like to see what you have to offer.",OrthodoxChristianity

Although I won't guarantee that I'll ask one of those questions. I hope all my thoughts and questions are laid out plainly and clearly for everyone to understand. English is my first language, and I can barely speak it \*^(que laughter at self-degrading joke\*)

# Justification

1A: I'll be upfront and honest on this one. The EO church teaches justification by faith and works and that terrifies me. Considering now that you guys might be right about everything, this teaching, in particular, strikes me with a consuming fear and anxiety and this I think is, or will be, my greatest hurdle to overcome in becoming Orthodox. Currently, in my reformed faith, I believe that Christ accomplished all that is necessary for my salvation in His life, death, and resurrection. This gives me great peace and comfort knowing that my standing before God is based on the life and works of Christ and not my sin-prone-self. If I sin I confess it knowing it's forgiven and move on to try and not fall again. If I start to despair or wonder if I truly am in right standing with God I turn myself to the cross and see His death taking away all my sins, and because of that, I'm comforted, knowing that God has taken away my sins. My reason for damnation, for alienation from God, is gone and I am His son now.

1B: I don't believe that I or anyone can truly put their faith/trust/hope in Christ and continue on in life loving sin or fail to start producing good works.  What gives me comfort is that these good works are guaranteed to be produced in me by God and He will preserve me in the faith to carry on to the end. It gives me anxiety thinking that if I fail to do what is good or not do it as often as I should I'm putting myself in danger of hell. Truly my fear is separation from Christ. To think that I could die, and not be with Him...that really is hell and it's the only thing I fear. But my protestant faith so far has given me the peace necessary to not be consumed by fear and anxiety. My worry is that if I become Orthodox there's nothing there to give me any sort of peace knowing that I belong to God and not agonize if I've done enough good, or even if in the future I would somehow fall away from the faith. Don't get me wrong, I love Christ, I want to do good, I think I do good, or at least hope I do. But I really try not to think about it too much because I don't want to become self-righteous or fall into despair. And I think I can only do that because my good works don't save me. Within Orthodoxy, that barrier falls and I don't know how I could escape the constant state of self-examination that I once struggled with so deeply in my earlier years of being a Christian. I take comfort in the Psalms when God offers Himself as our refuge, our rock, our hope. And as it says here

&gt;For it stands in scripture:  ‚ÄúBehold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and he who believes in him will not be put to shame.‚Äù [1 Peter 2:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A6&amp;version=RSVCE)

""He who believes in him will not be put to shame."" How comforting this is to me. Frankly, the less I see myself in control of my salvation and see God in control, the less fear I have of screwing this all up.

1C: Now to try and end my fearful lamenting. I've been trying to understand with more clarity how good works play out in justification and what that looks like within EO. I've had some trouble with it. What confuses me is when I read statements about the EO view of justification that's meant to clarify the position because it usually ends up sounding fairly similar to what Protestants hold to now. For example, In Decree 13 of *Confession of Dositheus* it says

&gt;We believe a man to be not simply justified through faith alone, but through faith which works through love, that is to say, through faith and works.

I feel some commonality with that statement. I agree that no faith which fails to ""work through love"" is justifying faith. But I would not end it by saying works now justify. The protestant would simply say the faith is faulty. And then the author of [this article](https://orthodoxbridge.com/2018/11/09/orthodoxys-official-response-to-calvinism-the-confession-of-dositheus-1673/), commenting on the previous quote, says

&gt;They explained that good works is a manifestation or fruit of faith, something quite different from the medieval Roman Catholic understanding of good works as meritorious.

That sounds a lot like the protestant understanding of good works. That good works a fruit of faith and not meritorious for salvation. So I'm left quite confused and I assume there's something I'm missing here or we really are in a much closer agreement than I expected.

1D: To close this section I'll say I feel like I'm missing something here. I don't believe any of you live in constant dread or fear of being condemned by God when you die. That isn't the kind of thinking I've seen on this subreddit. But personally, I don't know how to avoid it. I would love to discover in Orthodoxy, more grace, more love, more mercy, more living in the image of God, closer communion to God than I have now in my Protestantism, and less fear of condemnation, less fear of hell, less anxiety over if I'm currently and will be in right standing with God than I have now in my Protestantism. I would really like to see Orthodoxy become the ""fullness of the faith"" to me.

# Apostolic Succession

2A: One of the main things causing Orthodoxy to pull on my heart is the claim that it teaches what has been handed down to us by the Apostles. I haven't really taken this claim as seriously before because for some reason I kind of just lived under the idea that the ECF were really diverse in their beliefs (in whatever they did believe) and there wasn't this kind of unity and oral tradition intentionally passed down generation after generation. While it's starting to seem more and more likely to me that the EO claims of Apostolic Succession are true I feel that it would only be fair to read the ECF first to verify for myself if their teachings really do align with the EO. What ECF should I start out reading? Which works of theirs?

2B: I never took the idea of Apostolic Succession seriously before. I'm starting to understand a bit more as to why that's important but I was wondering if anyone could explain, or link me to any articles, podcasts, videos, or whatever, that helps explain why Apostolic Succession is so important?

2C: Dr. James White (Reformed Baptists apologist) partially dismisses the idea of Apostolic Succession by pointing to Irenaus claiming that Jesus lived up into His 50's and this was handed down to him by the apostles. Now as far as Dr. White knows (and as far as I know) no one really believes that today and yet that is the earliest record of someone claiming Apostolic Succession. So it would seem later claims would likely be dubious.

# Hiddennes 

3A: If EO is the one true church why has it mainly been contained in eastern Europe while Catholicism and Protestantism are much more global and both nearly 5 times the size of EO? Especially in light of the fact, EO is 1,500 years older than Protestantism.

3B: Why does it seem like there's a lack of missionary work compared to other Christian sects if this is the one true church? Josiah Trenham even acknowledges in the [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs0ExgnRMqc) of his book ""Rock and Sand"" that the Orthodox church has been behind on missions.

I know these things can't really be used to ""disqualify"" claims about truth and authority but it still seems concerning to me.

# Deuterocanonical Books

4A: The EO has the Deuterocanonical books. You guys have *79* books compared to my little *66* books. I really don't have any objection to there being more of God's word than I previously knew. That would be kind of great actually. Why do you consider these extra 13 books as inspired? 

4B: I've never read them before but I've heard protestants levy charges against them as containing errors or historical inaccuracies and thus we shouldn't hold them as scripture. I've also heard Dr. James White argue against the dueterocanon because St. Jerome who lived with the Jews said the Jews did not consider these books as inspired and since they didn't neither should we since the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God [Romans 3:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A2&amp;version=RSVCE). How do the EO respond and defend these books as historically accurate and without error?

# Bible Translations

5A: I've seen that a lot of people on this sub either use the OSB or the RSV-CE. Which one would be better to use for daily reading? 

5B: I've read some criticisms that the OSB commentary isn't very in-depth and somewhat surface level but for someone learning about Orthodoxy would it be beneficial to me or better to put my time and money elsewhere?

5C: I noticed that the OSB tries its best to make the NKJV translation match up with the Septuagint as much as possible. Why is that? Does EO see the Septuagint as more authoritative or reliable than the Masoretic text?

5D: Why is the RSV really the only other translation recommended? Especially in light of the fact there are *many* English translations to choose from. What are its pros and cons? Also, I've seen that people recommend two different prints of the RSV. The Oxford print and Ignatious print. What's the difference between the two?

# Miscellaneous 

6A: I've been baptized 3 times in my life. Once as an infant by a Seventh-Day Adventist pastor, again at age 13 by an Adventist pastor, and again when I was 18 by a Foursquare pastor because I didn't really convert until I was 15 and was under the impression that my previous baptisms were invalid. This was before I was convinced of paedobaptism (according to the presbyterian view). Would I have to be baptized again if I joined the EO church?

6B: Is there a sizeable group of toxic Orthodox people on the internet? I ask this not because of any bad experience of mine but because I've seen at times people critique the EO presence online as people being rather harsh or ungracious. I'm just wondering if that's something I should watch out for lol. It wouldn't be all too unfamiliar as in the reformed camp we have the ""cage stage Calvinist.""

If you really did read this whole post I appreciate it very much, I hope everything was quite clear and understandable. If I wasn't I'll be happy to try and explain myself further.

The closest EO church is a few cities away.

Can an Orthodox Christian take out a loan?,GrandDukeNotaras,1613355492,"Background to this post: i searched the term ""usury"" on this sub and found a bunch of discussion but was left none the wiser on the topic. I am not very well versed in this area. Also, this is not a post about me.

So the question is simple. A practicing Orthodox Christian wants to:

* buy a house 
* undertake studies at university
* purchase a vehicle

All of these activities are well beyond his financial means. The only option, should this person want to have a roof over his head, a decent job and mode of transport, is to take out a loan.

Is the Orthodox Christian to feel guilty of this? 

From what i've been able to ascertain, the opposition towards loans in patristic sources is due to the system in Roman/Byzantine times often leading to terrible sinful activity. But not so much nowadays? 

I've also seen polemicists against Orthodoxy use this as a ""gotcha"" when trying to show that the Orthodox church ""changed"" its teachings... using this as a prime example. Supposedly because Orthodox Christians in the modern world will all at some point take out a loan?

Questions from a potential convert Catholic -&gt; Orthodox,stellllaaaaaaaa,1613353243,"Hello,

-Popular piety surrounding Mary 
-Celibate priesthood

""And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it"" 

Jesus appears to establish a hierarchy (the pope) here, but my understanding is that the Orthodox don't buy this. What is the interpretation of this?

How to Respect One's Sunday Obligation,TimeLadyJ,1613320470,"I loved this email that came out from our priest this morning. It was inspired by the fact that today is a snow day, but also the fact that many see Sunday as second to vacation and other miscellaneous events. Especially in America.

&gt;Sunday is the holiest day of the week. We need to put our greatest effort into keeping every Sunday set apart, hallowed, and life-giving. So, what does this mean on a snow day or vacation? After a conversation yesterday, I thought I would share a few words on this. I hope this inspires reflection and a blessed Sunday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Obligation is a word widely misunderstood in our culture today. We tend to cringe at the notion of obligation and associate it with tyranny. In reality, this could not be farther from the truth! Indeed, obligation, in a Christian sense, is inseparably linked with freedom and joy. As Americans, we are obligated to serve and defend our nation and constitution. As a husband, I am obligated to love and cherish my wife. These are not shackles, by any means! On the contrary, these obligations help define who we are, give us purpose, and should inspire joy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our obligation to Sunday takes priority over everything else ‚Äî yes, even our nation, spouse, and family. As God expects us to tithe our financial means, He expects us to tithe our time. Sunday is the ‚Äúfirst-fruits‚Äù of the week. It is the Day of Resurrection ‚Äî a miniature Pascha every week. Okay, but how seriously do we need to take this obligation? The way we use our Sunday is the best indication of the god of our heart. Who do you worship ‚Äî family, sleep, entertainment, or our Heavenly Lord ‚Äî this is revealed best in the way one starts one‚Äôs week.  
&gt;  
&gt;First and foremost, by every means, we should get to Mass on Sunday. If it means driving or walking a few hours, do it (a regular part of life in many parts of the world). If it means disappointing family during a vacation, use Sunday as an opportunity to lovingly witness the importance of your faith, and go to church. If it means losing a few hours of sleep, consider the greater tragedy of falling into spiritual sleepiness. If we are to survive in our culture of secularism and apostasy, we must be willing to embrace sacrifice ‚Äî no pain, no game.  
&gt;  
&gt;What if I can‚Äôt get to church? Life happens. There are times when we cannot get to Mass. Some are sick and unable to get out. Some are at war or defending our country. For those who are healthy and able, it is occasionally acceptable to miss Mass once or twice a year due to unexpected circumstances. Sometimes, mother nature just keeps us home ‚Äî like today. In these circumstances, our joyful obligation is to do whatever we can to sanctify the day at home.  
&gt;  
&gt;I‚Äôd like to encourage you to consider ways to be deliberate about making your Sunday holy. In the very least, light your candles and incense, and spend 30 minutes to an hour in prayerful and scriptural devotion. This time of prayer should be longer and more intense than your normal daily morning prayer. Invite God‚Äôs grace into your day (and hence, your week), and then celebrate with food, merriment, and rest.

Obviously for some, attending in person isn't an option right now for reasons. Still, continue to treat Sunday as holy!

Can you help me translate the Akathist of the Holy Archangel Gabriel in English?,AutumnPhysics,1613306927,"I said I would help my parish with this and received blessing to translate it (originally from Romanian at this trusted website [https://doxologia.ro/ceaslov/acatiste/acatistul-sfantului-arhanghel-gavriil](https://doxologia.ro/ceaslov/acatiste/acatistul-sfantului-arhanghel-gavriil) ), but I underestimated the complexity of the task. To make matters worse, the Church Slavonic speakers told me that they could not find the exact version of the Akathist I was translating, and whilst some structural similarities exist with all akathists, and similarity to the language used in the akathist to the Holy Archangel Michael, there is no direct comparison that can be made.

Because I'm an immigrant, I have very limited contact with the Romanian Orthodox Church, otherwise I would have been recommended someone by now.

"David Bentley Hart, academic theology and the Orthodox Chuch",TimeSculpterer,1613303012,"I have noticed that one of the most popular and occurring questions in this subreddit is that of what are the major differences between the Protestant and the Orthodox Churches and their theological views.

There are plenty, but in my opinion one of the biggest ones is that in the center of the Orthodox life is **the Church and it's tradition**. The Church is the heritage that Christ left for us in this world. And so an Orthodox Christian is supposed to be faithful to the long Tradition of the Church and it's interpretations about the Scriptures etc., as the Creed mentions. 

I've found that this principle seems a bit difficult to comprehend for some people who come from Protestant/Reformed traditions. But it is a strong factor guiding the way of how an Orthodox Christian should relate to theology. Many of us, including myself, have been taught that an Orthodox Christian shouldn't be intrerpreting things like the Scriptures in isolation from the Tradition and views of the Church Fathers etc..

And this brings us to characters like David Bentley Hart. Please note, that I'm not discussing here about the themes that he speaks about, such as Universalism etc. There are already *plenty* of discussions about those here and elsewhere in the Internet. You can look that up, it shouldn't be that hard.

Instead this time I would like to ask your thoughts about this: what should an Orthodox Christian think about theology that is purely based on academic/scholarly work? 

I'm mentioning Mr. Hart as one example of this phenomenon. Please correct me if I'm wrong but if I have understood correctly, David Bentley Hart isn't a member of the clergy/monk/etc., but ""just"" a regular laity member of the Church. His academical work and list of publications is impressive, I'm not denying that at all. 

But how does his work and his claims relate to the Tradition? Has he had a blessing from his Bishop for his works? Or does he require one? How should we as Orthodox Christians relate to, for example, his own NT translation? 

I have been thinking this topic a lot personally and it's a bit difficult for me to get a grasp on. So I would love to hear other views about this one.",OrthodoxChristianity

Isaiah 53:10 big difference in Orthodox Study Bible,urosum,1613292729,"I am Orthodox, but my friends aren't.  We love to talk about theology.  I'm doing a bit of deep reading trying to pick apart penal substitutionary atonement, and I came across Isaiah 53:10, where we read prophetically about the coming messiah.

If you go to [https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Isaiah%2053:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Isaiah%2053:10) and look at every english translation it offers, you see variously, ""it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain.""  Only one translation offers any hope, with the Easy to Read Version and, ""the Lord was pleased with this humble servant who suffered such pain.""

The OSB gives us, ""The Lord wishes to cleanse Him of His wound...""  (Which is yet another reason I am Orthodox.)

Brenton's Septuagint online offers , ""The Lord also is pleased to purge him from his stroke...""

Even the footnotes in the NET translation offer no alternative to the Lord's ""crushing.""  So can one of you smart people expound on the difference?

Seriously need some advice....thinking about changing parishes,kingdavid0033,1613258229,"Hey everyone...so I need some advice. So, I‚Äôve been on this forum a while (part of that under another account), and some time ago I asked for advice due to not being able to get in contact with my Priest via email/phone/text due to him not responding to me. It has happened multiple times since I have been at this parish for over a year. I was Chrismated back in the middle of last year and my Catechesis was mostly done through Facebook live which is less than ideal, but I was happy to do that in order to become an Orthodox Christian. That being said, almost every time I have ever emailed him in the last year (probably 7-8 times to ask him a question and/or for his guidance) he doesn‚Äôt respond. A couple times I have waited 2-3 days and texted him asking if he got my email and I still don‚Äôt get a response. It‚Äôs more than frustrating as I am a ‚Äúbaby‚Äù Orthodox Christian and I‚Äôm going to have questions occasionally and need spiritual guidance.

More recently, I had an issue late last year when some of the people from the parish were arguing back and forth on social media and acting like children and fighting over politics, posting hateful stuff, etc and that bothered/depressed me quite a bit...to the point where I didn‚Äôt go to any Church services for over 2 months. I emailed him about all this after not hearing from him or getting the parish email for over 2 months and told him I was upset and why I hadn‚Äôt been coming and that I was depressed and my soul was hurting from not receiving the Sacraments. I wondered if I had been taken off the email list as well or something, but finally a few days later he called me (probably because he thought I was leaving), we talked about it and I felt better and went to Divine Liturgy the following Sunday. It still bothered me, but after talking to another local Orthodox Priest during that time I realized that I may have been overreacting a bit to the other people arguing about stuff (not that what they were doing was ok, especially in front of me) and the other Priest told me that I was always welcome there and he would never tell me to leave my current parish, but his door was always open and that I needed to be somewhere that I could grow as an Orthodox Christian wherever that may be. That being said I have been going as regularly as I can given my schedule allows and I try not to sign up every week so others can go, as we are doing a sign up system to ensure too many people aren‚Äôt in the building because of Covid. 

Anyhow, a couple weeks ago I emailed Father about something involving me giving money to the Church and I‚Äôll be darned, I get an immediate phone call from him. In that phone call we talked about many things, but very early in the conversation he asked me if I had emailed another Bishop of a nearby Orthodox parish complaining about not being able to attend Divine Liturgy there due to Covid restrictions. I hadn‚Äôt, of course, so I said no. He said well some newer convert in the area had and the Bishop brought it up in a meeting (how he had access to something like that I don‚Äôt know, but I digress) and he thought it might have been me. I didn‚Äôt really think much about it at the time, but it‚Äôs been kind of stuck in my head since and bothering me that he thought that. Oh, and last week he contacted me asking if I could help out in an event in the parish to which I said yes. Anyhow, fast forward to this last week, I emailed Father about seeing if he could guide me on starting a prayer rule to help me and I told him I have a few prayers I pray throughout the day and I would like have a rule to help me with that. No reply. Not a ‚Äúwe can talk about it later, or sure let‚Äôs plan to meet, send me what you‚Äôre currently doing‚Äù...nothing. 

I said all that to say this: what am I supposed to do with all this? I NEED spiritual guidance and I am not getting it. Other parishes in the area are very active, even through the pandemic and send out numerous emails and post numerous videos throughout the week. Father might send out one email a week and a while back, for over 2 months, he sent out nothing, during a pandemic! People need to hear from their Priest during these times and I definitely need it because half the time I have no idea what to do because I know next to nothing about being an Orthodox Christian due to my limited catechesis. There are some other concerns I‚Äôm not going to list on here that I worry about, but those are things I don‚Äôt have to answer for. 

That being said, I know no parish or Priest is perfect, but at the very least people need communication. Not just one video of Divine Liturgy a week and no words of encouragement or advice for months on end during a pandemic. I am beyond frustrated. Part of me wants to just leave and go to another parish, but part of me wants to stay and help out and maybe be part of the change there, but I do not remotely know where to begin. 

PS- this is not an older priest. He is in his 30‚Äôs and is technologically savvy so that isn‚Äôt an issue and our parish isn‚Äôt that big either. I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around it all.

Has anyone heard of something like this? Demon or mental health problem? I really need your opinions and experiences,MrPositive777,1613224687,"I became a Christian in spring 2019 and have been through hell since fall 2019. It's been a wild ride and it's not over. This is a long read.

Basically where this all started is when I told a lie while talking with the Holy Spirit just to see what happens. It was stupid, I know. I felt a terror beyond anything I have ever experienced and saw the word ""UNFORGIVABLE"" in the eye of my mind. Then I felt like my soul was being torn from my body.

The next day I had visions of hell and demons, and felt that God was going to kill me. The day after that I had some wild hallucinations. The Bible was emitting somekind of energy and I felt demons enter my body. I was barely able to say ""Jesus Christ is Lord"".

I thought I had lost the Holy Spirit and that I was going to be taken over by demons and be unable to control myself. So I decided to commit suicide, I went through with two attempts but they both failed.

Then I was sent to a mental hospital. I had more hallucinations there. Then something began to talk to me. It was able to communicate with me by moving my head, nodding it to say yes and shaking it to say no. It told me it was God and wanted me to spread what I now know to be a false prophecy. It also tried to make me sin in whichever way it could while also keeping me fooled, thinking it was God.

Once we found the right meds the hallucinations stopped. But I was still under the spell of whatever was talking to me, which I believed to be God.

Then once I got released from the mental health hospital the truth was revealed to me that it was not God. I won't get into it but I got definitive proof that convinced me.

After that it revealed to me its true vile nature, it said it was a demon and began blaspheming God in my mind. It is able to insert thoughts into my mind, verbal and visual thoughts, but it's not audible or hallucinations. It's like internal monologue or visual thoughts.

Now it just constantly tries to get me to reject Christ, leave Christianity, blaspheme God (especially the Holy Spirit), worship satan, commit any sin it can get me to commit from lying to stealing to suicide. Basically anything I think is unforgivable or will damn me, it is trying to get me to do those things.

At the same time I have felt a good force inside me. It makes me feel joy, peace, relief, renews my faith and strength. I believe this to be the Holy Spirit as I still believe in Christ and love God.

Questions about Orthodox views,cathordox,1613196152,"Hi, I‚Äôm considering becoming Orthodox but I have a couple of questions.

Lost Christian with questions about Orthodox Faith,didmoraz,1613195176,"Hello Orthodox Redditors,

For a little context about my life, I was raised in a Christian household since birth and was always taught Jesus Christ is the incarnate God, God the Son, second person of the Trinity. I went to a Christian school growing up and later went to a public school in a small town where I was baptized Baptist. Following graduation I strayed from the faith and God during college. I went a couple years without attending a church service. A few months ago my best friend from high school (who was recently baptized in the EO church) reignited my interest in Biblical theology. God has since used him to expand my understanding of Biblical concepts and the reality of God. I attended a Sunday liturgy service at a EO church in my city with my friend and it was my first time going to a liturgical church. I didn‚Äôt know much about iconography, the sacraments, or the church in general at the time but I was impressed with the beautiful art and icons of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I can feel the spirit of God drawing on me and want to find a church with like minded people. As I have learned more about the history of the church, I‚Äôm also drawn to liturgical/apostolic churches especially the Orthodox Church as apposed to my upbringings in a Baptist/Protestant church. I do have a few questions about the Eastern Orthodox Church/faith. Fair warning, I‚Äôm new to this stuff, so my questions might reflect my ignorance lol 

First, Baptism. I was baptized Baptist, in the name of the a Holy Trinity. God the Father, God the Son, and Hod the Holy Ghost. At the time, I was told and believed that baptism was more of an ‚Äúoutward symbol for an inward change‚Äù. It was a testament to the world that you belong to Christ. I have since come to understand that Baptism is more ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù for lack of better word. My question is, what does the EO church teach about Baptism? Can salvation be achieved for someone who is not baptized? If I were to join the Orthodox Church, I would need to be baptized again, correct? 

Second, the eucharist. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, the orthodox faith teaches the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ during the liturgy. I believe that the Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ. At this point, is the Eucharist BOTH bread, wine and the body and blood of Christ? For example, is the Eucharist physical bread/wine and the metaphysical body and blood of Christ? Not symbolically but metaphysically? Please help me understand where the shortcomings in my understanding of the eucharist are. I want to understand more as I really do believe the Eucharist is the body and blood. 

My third question is do y‚Äôall pray to saints? Is it okay to pray to anyone except the most high God? 

Finally my fourth question. Most people around me are not of Orthodox Faith, including my parents. However, my mother is very religious and God has used her to draw me toward Him. What does the Orthodox Faith teach about other Christians,people who believe Yeshua of Nazareth is the Son of God, the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament, and the incarnate God. Paul writes salvation is justified by faith. Of course we can‚Äôt know or assume Gods judgment, and it‚Äôs through His grace we are saved. Does the church teach people outside of the Orthodox faith can be saved and have the spirit of God living within them? 

If you read this much, thank you. I really want to understand these concepts more. I‚Äôm so interested in the actual reality of God and the spiritual experiences of Baptism and the Eucharist.

Election of Bishops,SSPXarecatholic,1613171278,"So recently I've been about the how and why of our episcopal election, in it's current method. To my knowledge the ancient practice was one in which the laos, as a whole, would select a candidate they viewed worthy to be their overseer (as we see in the tale of St. Ambrose). However, this practice simply fell out of use for whatever reason. While it seems like some methods of including non-clergy in the decision making process, it mostly seems like a decision made by the clergy, which for a while I had no problem with, but the more I think about it... well, it frankly just seems ""off"" and I'll try to explain why.

Our life, as Orthodox Christians, is hardly governed or overseen by the bishop directly, even if you're in the Cathedral he uses. Our life is generally overseen by his vicar, the Presbyter, who he appoints to the local parish to serve in his place and under his authority. Again, even as the non-clergy, we have pretty much 0 say in who gets sent our way. While we may certainly complain to the bishop if the Priest is being particularly onerous, we ultimately have to suck it up and live with that decision made by a person, who again, we did not select. Perhaps, this is the very reason why the bishop is not selected by the laos, but again, I'm unsure.

I guess, functionally, since this aspect of ecclesiology is fundamentally a matter of the Church's infrastructure, and not a part of the Church's *essential* character, why do we not change it back again? I love the bishop I am obedient to, he is a kind and warm man, this is not a rant against him or anyone for that matter. However, as a full member of the Church, being a necessary part of the process to elect the person who will have spiritual authority over me seems like such an obvious thing. The Church is *ours* as the laos, the people of God the Qahal Israel, and it seems like relegating this decision to the ordained serves to give the perspective that it is they who are the Church and we as merely spectators.

I have no good deeds - please pray for me,Different_Road_5750,1613168083,"Firstly I wish to express my thankfulness for your prayers several months ago, when I was checking into a rehabilitation center for the first time.

I always feel a sting when I read: ""not everyone who says 'Lord, Lord' gets in the Kingdom of Heaven. That would be me. I do say Lord, Lord - often, especially when in fear or anguish, or when my horrible vices are getting back at me. Sometimes I pray fervently and repent, but then at the first onset of struggle, I harden my heart again.

I've done heinous things, even while professing the faith with my mouth. I'm self-centered, manipulative and greedy person, for whom lies come as easily as blinking my eyes. Sobriety is hard. I'm back at day 12. My life is wholly unchristian. I fight my impulses by eating trash, smoking and so forth. You can imagine. I can't handle having a prayer rule outside my mind occasionally going through the Jesus-prayer, I've tried for many years. I can't really help others, as I am myself a subject of needing a lot of support. I'm conventionally nice, but that's about it. It's almost a vice at a supported housing unit I am in, as it brings me to too close a contact with active addicts. The Church is closed. I have no contact with the priest. I've yearned confessing my sins and receiving the eucharist, but that time seems to be looming somewhere in the distance. 

I feel a tad despondent, my days being spent staring at a computer screen. I've made countless, at the time earnest, attempts to truly repent and to live a christian life, but it seems I lack the constitution, the resolve, and the faith. I know for many the life is about stumbling and getting back up again, but I've literally crawled the whole time. 

Sorry for taking your time with this bawling, but I'd appreciate your prayers once again. Please pray that I would find somewhere in me the strength to pick up my cross and follow Christ, as this is my true desire under the layers and layers of false ones I've accustomed myself from young age to follow. You can call me Abraham.",OrthodoxChristianity
Problem with the book of Daniel,Public-Heretic,1613165039,"I find it difficult to accept the book of Daniel. It speaks of very public miracles, the centerpiece being the three youth in the furnace. I understand that the scriptures do not necessarily convey history in the way we mean it today, especially when it comes to events that happened much farther back than when they were written. But while that is, as some Orthodox say, ""historical myth"", the book of Daniel frankly feels more like a fable, with extreme and public miracles taking place, even what seems like the resurrection (per the note of the OSB) or time travel of the prophet Habakkuk. 

Why are the miracles in Daniel so ""fantastic"" as opposed to more ""moderate"" or ""hidden"" things we see in the other books? Is there any historical support whatsoever for the characters and events of the book?",OrthodoxChristianity
My late grandpa's life story - my proof of God,veltsmerc,1613159310,"I decided to write this because of 2 things:

1. I want to cheer up everyone who is currently suffering because of somebody's health problems, and help them restore their faith in God
2. I want to express my own emotions, to get everything out off my chest

Unfortunately, my dear grandpa died yesterday aged 68, after a 40-day-long fight with COVID-19. He was put on a mechanical ventilator on 22 January. We were scared to death, and I was already thinking about the worst scenario, but his condition was getting better on a daily basis and he was woken up from induced coma on 2 February. We were already preparing for his homecoming, but unfortunately, his heart was too tired and the doctors told us that he is on a ventilator again (9 February). I was absolutely devastated, but I still believed that he will live. We have been praying each and every day, and I am sure that it was God's will to prolong his fight in order to make us emotionally prepared for the moment of his true homecoming - journey to the home we all came from, and the home we will all go to. 

When I was two years old (2003), my grandpa was diagnosed with cancer. Prior to that, he had believed in God, but he had also had a lot of vices, which is normal considering his pretty hard childhood. He had been smoking, drinking a lot, eating unhealthy food, and he had also been criticizing my mother and uncle for fasting, even though he was a Christian. But, God works in miraculous ways, and his lung cancer was actually a blessing in disguise. After a long fight, the doctors told him that he was going to die in 2 months, as chemotherapy and radiation therapy couldn't help him. We were told that it was over, that we need to accept it and that we must prepare for the inevitable. But then, he decided that he wants to live.

He basically ran away from the hospital. He instantly stopped smoking and drinking, and started fasting and praying. My mother went to several monasteries to pray for him. Another important aspect of his healing process was the mental strength of my family - my grandma never allowed anyone to talk about his illness, and wanted us to treat it as if it was an ordinary cold. Day after day he was getting better and better, until he finally got cured. Even after he got well, a lot of doctors told us that there is still 'no way he will live more than two or three years'. About 8 years later, he was infected with smallpox, and he had his lungs scanned. Doctors were in disbelief when they looked at his former diagnosis, as his lungs were practically stainless. And he lived, and lived, and lived. He was there through my whole childhood and he had a huge influence on my faith, on my character, on my bravery. I am so thankful I had such a strong man guiding me through my life. He has been fasting ever since he got cured, and he has been attending liturgies every Sunday. He visited a lot of monasteries and he became a much better person. He died 18 years after being told that he was going to die in 2 months, and that's a huge, huge gift from God.

Today, at his funeral, I felt unusual relief. In fact, what I felt was happiness rather than sadness. I am sure that he went straight into the Kingdom of Heaven. His own repentance, prayers and belief have ensured him a place there, as well as our restless prayers from the past month. This was the first funeral I've ever attained in my life, and I could definitely feel that God himself was holding my tears. I knew I needed to be strong, especially for my grandma, who is, of course, suffering the most.

I know it's hard for you all to understand this in those hard moments, but whatever happens, please keep praying. It may be hard, it may even seem pointless sometimes, but bear in mind that no one can ""lose"" with God. Getting cured or dying in faith and prayers of your loved ones is basically a win-win situation, as that soul is going to be saved either way. And remember, it's okay to cry.

Please, mention my late grandpa Jovica in your prayers.",OrthodoxChristianity

CoViD 19 and Vaccine,Archdaemon88,1613152306,"Hello all,

I hope that you are all well.

I am an ICU nurse dealing with C-19 patients since the February 2020. I received my first vaccine ,and only one due to shortages and redistribution, in December 2020. I recently spoke with my parents who told me that our spiritual father was told and has told them that the vaccine is ""of the devil"". I did not tell them that I got it and they haven't asked if I did either so I never lied although I am not sure how to proceed with this. When did the church (or if the church) deem the vaccines harmful for our soul. 

According to them I am to repent for getting the vaccine (as my aunt had received it prior to me). I got it with the intention of protecting my family as I am in direct contact with C-19 patients although very well protected with PPE (i do not live with them). I need some guidance.

Questions about Orthodoxy and Catholicism,cathordox,1613079865,"So I am a Protestant who has been looking into becoming Catholic but there are a few things that I really don't like about Catholicism (particularly their emphasis on natural law) and it seems like Orthodoxy might be the better option but there are a couple of things that I have problems with that I was hoping I could get some help with.

1. It seems like a lot fo the disagreements with Catholicism that Orthodox Christians voice have less to do with actual theology and more to do with dislike of the Catholic Church, the Pope, etc. Are there different schools of thought about Catholicism and its relationship with Orthodoxy within the Orthodox Church? For example, are there some Orthodox who are much less hardline and more conciliatory towards the Catholic Church?

2. How much of what Catholics believe are Orthodox allowed to believe? Can Catholics believe in Purgatory and the Filioque? I've read that historically these things weren't really doctrines the Orthodox Church said were wrong just more of they couldn't confirm or deny. So can Orthodox Christians believe in them? My understanding is the same for the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary, they weren't things that Orthodox Christians rejected but they didn't necessarily say officially that they were true. So pretty much, how ""Catholic"" can you be while still being Orthodox?

3. What is the Orthodox Church's stance on natural law and its relation with doctrine? Is it given the same level of authority as in the Catholic Church?

4. My biggest hangup with Orthodoxy is the ecumenical councils and when they stop getting counted as ecumenical. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches both accept the first 7 ecumenical councils I believe. But after that the Catholic Churches have had many more while the Orthodox Churches haven't had anymore that they recognize even as they attended at least some (Florence). The only answer I can really find here as to why that would be is that the other Catholic councils don't get accepted because the people rejected them. I find this to be rather laughable as an idea and more of a way to come up with an excuse for not accepting church councils you already don't want to accept. The best argument I can think of for why some councils are accepted by the Orthodox Church and others aren't is that to be an Ecumenical Council you need support of the Patriarchs and since most of the Catholic councils excluded easterners from the Orthodox Church they could not give their acceptance to the councils and thus they are not valid. Can anyone shine light on this issue?

5. My understanding is that the Orthodox Church doesn't say it is a sin to not go to Church on a Sunday necessarily, though it might be if you make a habit of not going. So what are valid reasons for missing a Sunday service? Could it be as simple as I want to go visit family/friends that I haven't seen in a while?",OrthodoxChristianity

Who are those sat on thrones to whom judgment is given in Revelation 20:4?,SonOfGod2087,1613071970,"

And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark on their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (Revelation 20:4 ‚Äì American King James Version).

Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. (Daniel 7:22 ‚Äì American King James Version).

And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. (Matthew 19:28 ‚Äì American King James Version).

Those sat on thrones in Revelation 20:4 are all the saints, and not just some of them. In fact Daniel 7:22 speaks of all the saints, to whom judgment will be given after Jesus' second coming. Matthew 19:28 speaks only of twelve apostles who will be sat on twelve thrones to judge, because Jesus was speaking specifically of twelve saints, not implying that only twelve saints would have judged.
If all the saints will judge, then all the saints who will judge include the raised saints in Revelation 20:4. In Revelation 20:4 John saw the thrones and those who sat on them to whom judgment was given, and afterwards he saw those who came back to life; but the scenes here are not placed in chronological order, for chronologically, in Revelation 20:4 first people come back to life and afterwards sit on thrones to judge.
Note that the saints will not literally be sat on thrones, since this is a symbolic description.
So all the saints, that is, all the people who will inherit eternal life and judge, are all those who will be raised at Christ's second coming and those who will be found alive at his second coming (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).
In relation to Revelation 20:4, the judgment will be the condemnation of all unrighteous people who will be found alive at Christ's second coming. All unrighteous people found alive at Christ's second coming will die (2 Peter 3:7). They will raise in the resurrection of the unrighteous that will take place 1,000 years later (Revelation 20:5; Revelation 20:7-9; Revelation 20:12-13) along with all other unrighteous people who have died throughout history, who will all be condemned to not inherit eternal life (Isaiah 24:22; Revelation 20:5).
Furthermore, the saints will also judge the angels (1 Corinthians 6:3), i.e. all the angels who sinned and who will be condemned as all the unrighteous men.",OrthodoxChristianity

"I almost apostasized, and I feel ashamed. How do I talk to my priest about this?",Significant_Plum_219,1613067818,"I'm a college student who has been having great struggles maintaining my faith, especially following my isolation from my Orthodox community after the COVID-19 pandemic. I've been having great looming doubts about communion (why do children receive anaphylactic shock from communion bread?), sainthood (there are emperor ""saints"" in the Church that have committed mass genocide on other religions), and even theosis itself (mostly because I see so much bigotry and far-right reactionary rhetoric online but also in some Orthodox communities. How can I trust in the Church being the perfect guide for the process of theosis if so many Orthodox Christians seem to be more angry and negative than the non-Christians I see in my day to day life?)

These doubts led to my eventually visiting and worshipping with other Churches. I never took communion with anyone else, but I did attend Bible studies and other worship meetings. I wanted badly to return to my home parish in my heart, but I couldn't reconcile my doubts.

The devil hates good works,leon1271,1613063480,"In the following text of Saint Isaac the Syrian we see that the devil hates good works‚Ä¶

When you want to start a good project, first prepare yourself to face the temptations that are going to come against you.

Because the enemy, when he sees someone start a godly life with warm faith, is used to attacking him with various and terrible temptations, so that the person will be intimidated by them and abandon his good intention.

&amp;#x200B;

And God allows you to be tempted to persistently strike His prey (of mercy) and to root in your mind, from the fear of sorrows, the memory of Him, and to approach Him with prayers, so that may your heart be sanctified by His incessant remembrance. And when you invoke Him, He will hear you. And you will learn that God is the one who redeems you. And then you will feel the presence of the One who created you and strengthens and protects you.

&amp;#x200B;

Because the roof and providence of God embraces all people. But it becomes visible only to those who have purified themselves from sin and are constantly devoted to God. In fact, the help and providence of God is extremely revealed to them, when they are put to a great test for the sake of the truth. because then they feel it very clearly with the sense of the mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Some, who saw this (help) and with their physical eyes, according to the trials, and thus found the support of God, were motivated by it to brave deeds, as we learn about James and Jesus the Navi and the Three Children and the apostle Peter and the other saints, who exercised for Christ. To them (divine help) it was obvious, having a human form, giving them courage and preparing them for the struggle of piety.

 

But also to the fathers, who lived in the desert and drove out the demons from there and became dwellings of angels, and in them the holy angels were constantly presented and in every way helped and supported them in everything and supported them and freed them from temptations, that the wild demons were causing them. But even today the help of God is not removed from the people who are completely devoted to the works that He pleases, but is close to all those who invoke Him.

"Father Alexander Smemann: The Church is love, expectation and joy",leon1271,1612974486,"Beauty is never ""necessary"", ""functional"" or ""useful"".

And when, waiting for someone we love, we put a beautiful tablecloth on the table and decorate it with candles and flowers, we do it not out of necessity, but out of love.

And the Church is love, expectation and joy.

It is heaven on earth, according to our Orthodox Tradition.

It is the joy of recovered childhood, that free, unconditional and selfless joy, which in itself is capable of transforming the world.

In our mature, serious piety, we ask for definitions and justifications that are rooted in fear. Fear of corruption, divergence, ""pagan influences"", and the like.

But ""he that feareth is made perfect in love"" (1 John 4:18). As long as Christians love the Kingdom of God, and do not just discuss it, they will ""represent"" it and make it known through art and beauty.

And the priest of the mystery of joy will appear with a beautiful cloak, clothed in the glory of the Kingdom, for even in the form of man God appears in glory.

Christ is present in the sacrament of the Eucharist and as happened with Moses before God, His glory overlaps us. \[‚Ä¶\]

Father Alexander Schmemann

How ethnically insular are the parishes of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America?,Iraelia18,1612855731,"I'm a former Lutheran (and Sikh) looking to convert to Orthodox Christianity. I've been attending Divine Liturgy services for a couple of weeks (and will finally be able to attend one indoors this Sunday! So excited). The church near my two residences (my childhood home and my college dorm) are both under the ecumenical patriarchate. The one near my childhood home, at least so far, seems to be a healthy mix of ethnically Greek parishioners and converts like myself. They've been welcoming so far, but there's not much room for socialization with COVID going on. I'm not so worried about this congregation as I am about, say, any other parish under the ecumenical patriarchate.  


How ethnically insular do churches under the Ecumenical Patriarchate tend to be in America? Can I go to any with a reasonable expectation of fitting in with at least a sizable faction of congregants?   


Thanks for the help in advance, this has been torturing me all day. I agree with the Ecumenical Patriarchate on virtually every matter of doctrine, but the one thing keeping me from committing/making me still consider Catholicism are the horror stories I've heard about ethnic exclusion among certain parishes (it's also part of why I abandoned a prior attempt to become Sikh, along with a resurgent fascination in the victory of the cross that made me feel called to the faith).",OrthodoxChristianity

An honest request: explain the Trinity to me,Matar_Kubileya,1612849113,"Yeah, that's probably easier said than done. I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for it, but IME asking such questions on subs like r/AskAChristian tend to just devolve into inter-Christian wrangling more than actually productive answers. In my understanding, Orthodox Christianity is the one historically, culturally, and linguistically closest to the church fathers, so I feel that this sub is probably the best place for me to get a nuanced and in-depth answer.

As for me personally, I'm converting to Judaism, which as you probably know is rather less open to anything more than monitarianism/monism (there's probably a better word for that, but it's escaping me. I'll avoid calling it ""strict monotheism"" since that'll just invite dissension, but I also think ""monarchianism"" implies too much relationship to the various essentially Christian-derived heresies of the late Classical period, so ""monitarianism"" it is). But I also believe that understanding other people's beliefs and challenging one's own is essentially a good thing, and I've found that Trinitarianism is a damn hard thing to wrap my head around. I also have enough background in Greek philosophy and language that I find the rather imprecise terms used in English are vague at best and confusing at worst, so a lot of written materials don't do enough for me. I can wrap my head around the idea *that* God is one *physis* in three *hypostases* (please correct me if there's a better way to phrase that), but I find that idea not meaningfully distinct from saying that ""there are three separate gods of one common nature"" much like, say, three atoms of oxygen or three bean-plants are of one nature in some sense, but the three things are very much distinct identities. Thus, while I can conceive of *an* understanding of a trinity, I cannot conceive of it as a monotheism, if that makes sense, but I'd gladly like to see that challenged. 

Furthermore, I would also argue that it is not only biblically unjustified but contradictory to the Torah. I base this on Deuteronomy 6:4, the Shema, ""hear, o Israel, Hashem is god, Hashem is one"". The particular word for ""one"" is ""◊ê◊ó◊ì"", cognate to the word ""◊ó◊ì"", ""a single thing"". While not necessary exclusive on its own to some Trinitarian formulae, the meaning also does not suggest a trinity, this combined with the historical record implies that the Trinity was a novel Christian development at odds with the traditional understanding.

As a final, brief question, is the Christian use of *hypostasis* essentially similar to the Platonic usage (with which I am slightly more familiar), or is there a meaningful difference besides the fact that they refer to different things?

Again, apologies if this is improper; my desire is essentially to understand. I have presented my understanding as above, I eagerly welcome that it be critiqued and leave it open-ended as to what points any of you would like to make.",OrthodoxChristianity

"Hello everyone, I'm new to this group, I need an advice from all of you in regards to my Spiritual journey let's say and beliefs.",PsychologicalRoof387,1612839509,"I come from a respectable and educated family in the middle east where both of my parents are very well known and involved in the orthodox community.

Since I was a child, my parents gave me freedom to choose my way in life. They taught me as delicately as they can the message of Christ, about orthodoxy and gave me the freedom to believe in christianity or not, to find my own preferences and callings in life.

I think this is something unusual to find in many religious homes let's say.

My problem is that I want to regain my spiritual connection with God Via orthodoxy and want to know what are your opinions on doing that and the ways that I can achieve it.

After many years of not caring a lot about Christianity and my faith, I realized that I wasn't mentally and spiritually strong as I should have been and that Was what Gave me many problems in my life.

After also comparing The different Christian branches throughout the years, I realized that orthodox is unmatchable in terms of spirituality and belief.

I also have studied a bit on peaceful religions such as Hinduism, buddhism, Taosim and Jainism which are beautiful religions As well.

In the end, I respect all peaceful religions because they are an added value to us humans.

Regarding my Journey on Orthodoxy, I feel this is a calling for me to go back to My roots, what started my motivation in life, my self confidence, regaining self and mind control as well.


I will highlight to you some of the reasons that have led to me not caring/pausing my interest about my faith throughout the years.


1- Not having The self-confidence, The right mindset to realize what I was missing.

2- Interacting and living in a semi-muslim ambiance was very negative for me, for my faith and my spirituality. Let's say that it's not pleasant living and Interacting with muslims to be honest with all of you especially at a very young age because no matter how their way of life is, all of them in the end are the same (except the communist/nationalist ones which are open minded and free thinkers). Examples: Ignorance, hate, delusion, feeling Pity and Superior on minorities mentality, etc. You got the message.

3-  Western Influence on young kids which I was part of especially what we tend to Grasp from the western culture such as The trends and all ( which in my opinion steers you away from your faith and spiritual connections). Always to note mixing the western and eastern cultures together is Good because  It let's you see and realize what you are missing on both sides.

4- Caring too much about people's opinions and thoughts and not thinking about myself, about my faith, healing my mind and thoughts and The people that I truly Cherish and care about.

5- I'm by nature a very stubborn and sensitive person which played and still playing a big part in haulting any kind of long journey process that I may follow.

PS: I don't necessarily blame my parents for not being a devoted and spiritual person because they gave me the choice my way of life anr anytime I tend to avoid Christianity and Orthodoxy, it comes back calling me in mysterious ways.

Orthodox Extracurricular Activities?,Professional_Media33,1612834389,"Hello! 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this is somewhat of a strange request, but I just don't know where else to ask this. I am currently a high school student (sophomore) and am going through the whole ""preparing for college applications"" process. In order to get into a reputable university, they generally look for someone with a ""spike"" in extracurriculars - basically, that means you dedicate yourself to something specific you are passionate about. My ""spike"" is activities revolving around Orthodoxy (and some STEM things on the side). 

I have spent a month working in a monastery in Israel. I'm trying to get involved with a priest to write icons.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Catholic myself, was in seminary for 2 years and have been living the life of a lay person for 3 or 4 years now. The reason I ask is because I have been drawn to Orthodox devotions (I have been saying the Jesus prayer with chotki for 5 years now), prayed through portions of the Philokalia and found several theological concepts quiet compelling in recent years.

&amp;#x200B;

I have matured enough to realize that I ought to look before I leap and, moreover treat with immediate suspicion any strong emotion that urges me in one particular direction (1 John 4:1 after all!). But I also trust my intuition which is telling me that I think that I maybe, just maybe ought to at least investigate the EOC a little bit further than just what I have gleaned over the past little while.

Any information would be helpful. I am starting to pray over this and it just... feels right, and more than in just an emotional way, it makes spiritual sense.

Dilemma of Faith,captsaginov,1612415655,"Hello all, I am a baptized RC (as an infant), practicing-ish Protestant who is DEEPLY drawn to EO. For about 5-6 years now I have been working to convince my bride of 18 years, that we should join the Church. She is adamantly against it and has stated that she will never convert. At this point, we don't attend church because she (raised in the Charismatic/Word of Faith movement - as I was) sees EO as a dead/lifeless form of Christianity and also takes serious issue with icons/relics, and I have my own issues (many of which she does share) with the Evangelical/Charismatic church. I am torn between the decision to convert alone (I mean, we aren't attending church anyway) or continue in the Protestant church to prevent a potential rift in our family by my choosing to do this without her or our children (ages 15 and younger). Have any of you EO brothers and sisters experienced this? If so, how did you navigate? Prayers are appreciated. Grace and Peace to you all.",OrthodoxChristianity

I have never used reddit before so if this post is inappropriate for any reason feel free to delete it. I am posting this same message in r/Catholicism and r/OrthodoxChristianity as well

I was raised in a Protestant household  but I was a solid atheist from 12 years old until about a year ago (I am 26). 

Like I said in the title of this, I am sure you have heard this story plenty of times. I am fairly certain I am either Catholic or Orthodox at this point. I don't believe sola scriptura at all. I don't find it wrong to pray to saints and ask them to pray for me. I pray the Jesus Prayer on a prayer rope and have started praying the rosary as well. You get the picture, I think. You've heard it 1,000,000 times. 

I must admit I haven't dug too deep into either tradition yet and believe most of my research has been EXTREMELY base level. (I have been very focused on finishing the Bible and I am almost done, at least with the Protestant books). I've attended an Orthodox Church of America's divine liturgy (during COVID restrictions and church members said it was very far from a usual experience), skimmed through some parts of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, read ""Everlasting Man"" by Chesteron, and I watch tons of videos from ""Bible Illustrated"", ""Breaking in the Habit"", and Stephen K Ray on Youtube.  

Like every Protestant, I find myself troubled by the idea of the Papacy the most. I can accept the real presence, praying to saints, etc. like I said earlier, but the Papacy is hard to make heads or tails of and especially because so much of the role seems to be defined much later in history, after the fact. Again, if the Papacy is valid then I have no problem accepting this. Truth doesn't care about what ""troubles"" me. 

So, you can argue your points about this if you want. In fact, I would enjoy reading what you have to say. What I am more interested in finding, though, is some primary source material on the subject. I understand and have been told by a Catholic friend that ""Upon This Rock"" by Ray has great primary sources and quotes etc. etc. but I am looking for the actual primary sources on this topic. Not just ""church fathers"" but what church fathers and where? This information would be appreciated, whether to support or reject the the Roman Catholic position. Again, feel free to just straight up argue your point. I would be happy to read it, but at the same time that isn't exactly the intent behind me posting this.",OrthodoxChristianity

Trusting the church,Vasilisonofspiro,1612377452,"For the last couple weeks I‚Äôve been struggling with tough doubts ( I‚Äôve posted a lot about them hopefully this will be my last ). At the end of the day however each doubt ends up really being the same question, how can I trust the church. 

At first I thought it was as simple if you prayed the truth would reveal itself to you, however I realized that there are tons of religious and virtuous people who never arrive at the truth.

Then I thought reading about the church fathers and history would lead to the truth. But then I found historians who specialized in patristics and early church who came to radically different conclusions as myself ( Most depict the early church as something less sacramental with a looser hierarchy spontaneity and no concept of priesthood ). I cannot accuse these scholars of ignorance. 

Now I am not saying that scholars are infallible however I have found the Orthodox response lacking. I have yet to see our men challenge the scholarly consensus so far all I see happening is us pointing to third and second century sources and hiding behind tradition. 

At the end of the day how do we know our tradition is even traditional, how do we know it was what the apostles even taught. 

At the end of the day I cannot say how I know the church is the truth or even Christ is. I believe ( imperfectly however) don‚Äôt get me wrong but I struggle to articulate and justify my belief. It sometimes feels like pure blind faith.

""Will there be even a few Orthodox Christians among you who will follow the hard and narrow way of Christ which is uncompromisingly opposed to the broad and easy way of ecclesiastical division and schism because of nationalistic, ethnic, chauvinistic, political, ideological and personal passions and interests which leads to destruction, both here and in the age to come? Will there be at least some who say: 'I am a Christian; I am Orthodox. I belong to the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church of Christ. I am of one mind, one heart, one soul, and one body with all those who belong to Christ and the Church, whatever their nationality and political opinions. I stand steadfastly opposed to those who use Christ's Church for any secular, nationalistic, ideological or political purpose, however apparently noble and justifiable.'? The future of Orthodoxy depends on the few in all countries of the earth who follow the narrow way which insists that the Orthodox Church must be the Church and nothing but the Church: the presence and foretaste of God's kingdom on earth for all peoples who wish to enter and be saved.""

‚Äî St. Isaac the Syrian

‚ÄùYou, the rich, how far will you push your frenzied greed? . . . When giving to the poor, you are not giving him what is yours; rather, you are paying him back what is his. Indeed, what is common to all, and has been given to all to make use of, you have usurped for yourself alone. The earth belongs to all, and not only to the rich . . . You are paying him back, therefore, your debt; you are not giving gratuitously what you do not owe.‚Äù
‚Äî St. Ambrose of Milan, ‚ÄòSermon on Naboth‚Äô

‚ÄúNot to share one‚Äôs wealth with the poor is to steal from them and to take away their livelihood. It is not our own good, which we hold, but theirs.‚Äù
‚Äî St. John Chrysostom, ‚ÄòOn Lazarus and the Rich Man‚Äô

‚ÄúEvery rich person is either a thief or the heir of a thief.‚Äù
‚Äî St. Jerome, ‚ÄòHomilies on Jeremiah‚Äô

‚ÄúAll possessions are by nature unrighteous when a man possesses them for personal advantage as being entirely his own, and does not bring them into the common stock for those in need.‚Äù
‚Äî St. Clement of Alexandria, ‚ÄòThe Rich Man‚Äôs Salvation‚Äô

‚ÄúWhat are then, tell me, the goods that you claim to possess? To what extent are they an essential part of your life? The problem with the rich is that they are like the man who takes a seat in a theatre, and then denies entrance to others, usurping thereby, and appropriating for himself what is meant for common use. The rich regard as their own those goods that they have acquired before the others, for the sole reason of having been the first to acquire them. If each one of us took only what is necessary for his sustenance, leaving what is superfluous for the indigent, there would be no distinction of rich and poor. You have become an exploiter by appropriating for yourself the goods that you were called to administer. The bread that you keep for yourself belongs to the hungry; to the naked belong the clothes that you hoard in your closet; to the barefooted belongs the shoes that is gathering moth in your home; the indigent have a right to the money you hide in your coffers.‚Äù
‚Äî St. Basil the Great, ‚ÄòOn Avarice‚Äô

‚ÄúIn vain do they think themselves innocent who appropriate to their own use alone those goods which God gave in common; by not giving to others that which they themselves receive, they become homicides and murderers, inasmuch as in keeping for themselves those things which would alleviate the sufferings of the poor, we may say that every day they cause the death of as many persons as they might have fed and did not. When, therefore, we offer the means of living to the indigent, we do not give them anything of ours, but that which of right belongs to them. It is less a work of mercy which we perform than the payment of a debt.‚Äù
‚Äî St. Gregory the Great

‚ÄúAll the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.‚Äù
‚Äî Acts 4:32

‚ÄúBeloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.‚Äù
‚Äî 1 John 4:7-11

‚ÄùThe bread you do not use is the bread of the hungry. The garment hanging in your wardrobe belongs to him who is naked. The shoes you do not wear are the shoes of those who are barefoot. The money you keep locked away is the money of the poor. The acts of charity you do not perform are so many injustices you commit.‚Äù
‚Äî St. Basil the Great

""Let us imitate God‚Äôs law of creation. He makes the rain fall on the righteous and the wicked and makes his sun rise upon all human beings without distinction. He gives to all the creatures living on earth vast spaces, springs, rivers, forests‚Ä¶and his gifts ought not to be appropriated by the mighty nor by governments‚Ä¶Hold fast then to that primitive equality, forget subsequent divisions. Attend not to the law of the strong but to the law of the Creator. Help nature to the best of your ability, honour the freedom of creation, protect your species from dishonour, come to its aid in sickness, rescue it from poverty‚Ä¶You who are Christ‚Äôs servants, his brethren and fellow-heirs, while it is still not too late, [in the poor] help Christ, feed Christ, clothe Christ, welcome Christ, honour Christ‚Ä¶"" 
‚ÄîSt Gregory the Theologian

""The possessions of the Emperor, the city, the squares, and the streets, belong to all men, and we all use them in an equal degree. Look at the economy that God has arranged. He has created some things that are for everyone, including the air, sun, water, earth, heaven, sea, light, and stars, and He has divided them equally among all men, as if they were brothers. This, if nothing else, should shame the human race. The Emperor has made other things common to all, including the baths, cities, squares, and streets. There is not the slightest disagreement over this common property but everything is accomplished peacefully. If someone tries to take something and claim it as his own personal possession, then quarrels arise. It is as if the very forces of natures were complaining, and as if at that time when God was gathering them from everywhere they were trying with all their might to separate among themselves, to isolate themselves from each other, and to distinguish their own individual property by coldly saying that ‚Äòthis is yours but that is mine‚Äô. If this were true, quarrels and bitterness would arise, but where there is nothing of this sort neither quarrels nor disagreements occur. In this way we see that for us as well a common and not an individual ownership of things has been ordained, and that this is according to nature itself. Is not the reason that no one ever goes to court about the ownership of a public square the fact that this square belongs to all?"" 
‚ÄîSt. John Chrysostom

""In just a little while, his life will be snatched away, and what is [the rich person] thinking? 'I will pull down my barns and build larger ones.' Well done, I would say for my part. The treasuries of injustice well deserve to be torn down. With your own hands, raze these misbegotten structures. Destroy the granaries from which no one has ever gone away satisfied. Demolish every storehouse of greed, pull down the roofs, tear away the walls, expose the moldering grain to the sunlight, lead forth from prison the fettered wealth, vanquish the gloomy vaults of Mammon....'But whom do I treat unjustly,' you say, 'by keeping what is my own?' Tell me, what is your own? What did you bring into this life? From where did you receive it? It is as if someone where to take the first seat in the theater, then bar everyone else from attending, so that one person alone enjoys what is offered for the benefit of all in common - this is what the rich do. They seize common goods before others have the opportunity, then claim them as their own by right of preemption.""

"Seeking Advice on how to deal with 'ghosts', invisible mischief makers in the home",Mahtorra,1612344748,"Orthodox Christian here.  I am looking for any advice on how to deal with, stop if possible,  unexplained activity in my home.  My husband and I live in a city flat, and have done so for over 10 years.  Its a nice building near parks.  With the exception of a 2 weeks period following my father-in-laws death, we have never had any unexplained phenomena in the home.  However, in the last few months we have had multiple instances and are uncertain what to do.  The events are lights ceasing to work then working again, objects falling inside cupboards, thumps and bump noises.  Its been occasional, minor and irritating things.  On one occasion my husband saw the linen cupboard door (which is stiff) open by itself.   However, this morning as my husband and I were in the kitchen the cooker top turned on by itself to high, whilst a plastic kitchen appliance was on top of it.  This was dangerous and it is now worrying me.  

My husband is a physicist  and says he does not believe in 'ghosts' and is at a loss to explain it.  The only thing I can think is that we are on the main road to the city hospital and with, sadly 1,500 deaths a day in our little country, the ambulances and all day and night.  They also stop at the lights just outside our flat.  We have asked our neighbours, but they do not seem to share this experience.  

Is there perhaps a particular Saint that I could ask for assistance?  Unfortunately I do not have a close relationship to any priest in this city I would feel comfortable asking about this.  Any advice, and of course your prayers, would be most welcome.",OrthodoxChristianity

I get rejecting Christian Zionism. I get rejecting the claims of other faiths. I **don‚Äôt** get using the triple parentheses, using terms like ‚Äúlittle hats,‚Äù calling people parasites, push for expelling from the country, etc. 

So many of these hateful folk also like to pretend their just being critical of a specific issue when they get called on their crap, but more often than not there were a thousand better ways to say what they *supposedly* wanted to say in a way that would have made the issue at hand the focus rather than just expressing their hatred of the people.

Advice after repenting of theft?,Leotheosis,1612188460,"Brothers and Sisters,

I have recently started the journey of coming to Christ through the Orthodox Church. As part of that, I've been reflecting on many of the things that I've done wrong and for which I need God's forgiveness.

One of the things that's impressed itself on me after years of forgetting about it has been that, twenty years ago as a kid of about 13/14 years old, I stole money from my older brother. I don't think he noticed and he didn't seem to link it to me if he did. I want to give him an amount back that more than covers the original amount and which, I pray, makes up for any difficulty that I caused him.

There are things that are causing me concern. My brother is not only not a Christian, he's living, even by the standards of our time, a very wicked life (organised crime, all kinds of things I won't get into); I'm almost certain that the money will be spent on something ungodly but I suppose that's none of my business. 

The thing is by telling him that I've taken it and that I'm giving him money back, he's the sort of person who would focus on what was done wrong to him rather than seeing that someone is now trying to put it right and he has a very violent temper. If I give this back to him anonymously, maybe with a note that says something like: ""years ago I took ¬£X from you. I‚Äôm giving you back ¬£X for your trouble and ask for your forgiveness"" would that be taking the cowards way out?

I prayed about it and a thought that came to mind was that I stole it in secret, I can restore it in secret but I want to get the opinion of others in the Church before going with that idea. Any help would be deeply appreciated.

Please Guide Me on Orthodoxy,N0RedDays,1612131623,"Brothers and Sisters in Christ,

I hope you all are well. I am considering a conversion to the Eastern Orthodox branch of our faith. Some background on me:

I was raised as a Southern Baptist, left and became a Catholic in my High School Years, and eventually left Catholicism due to some specific disagreements. I have been, for lack of a better term, drifting ever since. I desire deeply to grow in my faith and to participate in Christ's church but I am so lost on how do so. I'm 21 now and worry about my spiritual future through adulthood.

I hold a strange set of beliefs, I believe, that has led me to be a bit of a Christian outcast in terms of denominations. Some if my beliefs I will put below:

1) I am 100% Trinitarian and believe in the divinity and humanity of Christ.

2) I believe in the sacraments and won't attend a church that doesnt believe in some iteration of the ""Real Presence"" in the Eucharist.

3) I am an Arminian of sorts and believe in Synergism of Salvation and Damnation. I think double Predestination is a terrible idea.

4) I believe in Theistic Evolution and don't believe the earth is 6000 years old, etc.

5) I have no problem with Confession, but during my time as a Catholic it was very hard for me. I have OCD and moral scrupulosity so I would often end up going to confession multiple times per week. I still believe I'm doomed to hell because I'm a bad Christian, so I sort of feel hopeless to an extent

6) I'm very pro-life but I still believe (non-abortifacient) birth control, when used in Marriage, is not immoral. This one point of contention I have with catholics. 

Does it sound like I would fit in the Orthodox church? I don't mean to sound argumentative about what I believe, but these are just some of my convictions that I hold somewhat closely. I don't know any official Orthodox positions so I thought I would ask you all. Thank you very much for any help you can provide. God Bless you all",OrthodoxChristianity

Questions,electroboss1,1612123548,"Hi. I am a high schooler that has been diving deeper into Christianity. I would probably consider myself Protestant right now, but have been recently drawn to Orthodoxy. I had some questions that I wanted to ask and hopefully get answers for. I divided it into three sections. They are overall important questions, personally important questions, and personally curious questions. Ideally, I would get answers, plus scriptural citations when necessary.

**Overall important questions:**

1) How does one acquire salvation in the Orthodox church? I have seen some saying that the Eucharist is a requirement. Others say that baptism and chrismation by a validly ordained priest (else than just baptism in general) is required. Could this be cleared up for me?

2) How do prayers to saints work/ how are they understood? My Protestant upbringing had me struggling with this for a while, but after I redefined prayer as a form of communication it made more sense. Do we expect saints to directly do something for us, or is it simply asking for their prayers to God? Along similar lines, when someone asks a saint to save them, they are asking as a plea for their help in prayer rather than have them do something directly, right? 

3) Why are so many of the hymns, and things similar to them, talking about saints? I haven't dug too deeply here, but motived it during my research and was looking for an explanation? 

4) What is the important of some traditions in Orthodoxy? An example can be fasting. While I understand the importance of fasting, why is the fast specific on what you can and cannot eat? Wouldn't it be better to recommend people to simply eat less to fast (eating less and have some meat is better than eating a lot of seafood). 

**Personally important questions:**

1) Could someone help explain the Constantinople-Moscow schism for me? I understand the basics, but I was wondering how it effected the layperson around the world.

2) I live in America and was curious about the influences of ethnicity on the church, especially since there are many different overlapping churches here? I understand that the church is supposed to be for all, but I usually feel confused about this issue due to the emphasis on their origin in the name. I live in Chicago and was wondering if anyone could recommend a church or priest to contact for further inquires in the future. 

3) Why does it seem that there are some views among some Orthodox people (I know that I am over generalizing but this is based on some of the things I have read/seen) that are (at least in my opinion) strange. There are some that may strange claims about COVID, vaccines, masks, etc. I know that it isn't everyone because others support the science behind the vaccines, etc. and take precautions. (I am including layperson and clergy in these statements.) Is this more prevalent that I think or is it a small minority. I don't mean to cause offense, but I was curious based on what I have seen.

**Personally curious questions:**

1) What is the state of Orthodoxy in Asia (East and Southeast Asia in particular because my heritage are from these regions)? I would specifically like to ask about Japan, China, Korea, and Indonesia in no particular order.  

2) Is there any requirement for what the architecture of a church can be? I know that most stick to a specific style, but I know that some are made differently and was wondering what the rules were.

3) I found the chants truly amazing and wanted to know if everyone sang/could since like that. If everyone can, how do they learn to do so?

Thanks in advance for answers! I may have more questions down the line and may ask them later.",OrthodoxChristianity
So what does Orthodxy and the Bible say exactly about Intercourse ?,Special_charge,1612118268,"I know this is probably really controversial but I haven't found proper awnsers yet. So I research about what is allowed and what not when it comes to intercourse, though most of the sources were protestant which I don't trust. Basically what I am am wondering is if sex is allowed even without the goal to get a child- The other question what is about sexual fetishes/attractions/preferences? I know that it is weird to ask since I know usually we don't talk about sexual topics or the relation between male and female. Though before getting insecure and doing something that is bad/forbidden I rather ask here to be sure. I also could ask a priest, which I actually can't because the next church is about 50km away from my town and especially during corona this is most likely not the best option :/

Outsiders perspective of conspiracy theories,Evilbighead,1612105480,"I saw a post today about someone saying that this sub reddit is biased in a certain way and I just wanted to give my two cents about the so called liberal and conservative divide. I am not orthodox but have been interested in it for sometime. One thing that I have admired about orthodoxy is that many members of the church whether that be saints or just people on the internet are able see and point when people are being led astray. They can also see how god and satan have worked in both present and ancient history to gain their own ends. though some of these people are not humble or seem like loud mouths, I think we need more people like them. I have been called a conspiracy theorist for just saying that some present day events SEEM to indicate we are in the end times.  But didn't christ say that he would come like a theif in the night. Didn't the early disciples warn people even then of the last days. I get that some people get into a crusader mentality, but we have to take seriously the warning of the saints and make sure we are in line with what the church and therefore what christ teaches.

Picking a Patron Saint,AdVictoriam1776,1612053264,"For those of you who picked your patron saint- what criteria did you use to make this decision?

I spoke with my bishop briefly about it and he said I could pick someone close to my given name, or maybe go with an American saint, or do something else. In other words, there's some latitude. My deacon said that when looking for a godfather, I should look to someone who will challenge me. I assume this can apply to my patron  as well?

So far, here are some saints who stuck out to me just so you can judge my thought process:

\-Prophet Malachi- spoke God's truth and judgment despite what the Israelites were doing to rebel

\-St. Seraphim of Sarov- extreme ascetic, for some reason his story stuck out to me

\-St. Philip of Moscow- refused to endorse evil (I also watched a movie ""Metropolitan"" with his story and it has always stuck with me)

What John 20:23 means? Should we confess to priests or to Jesus directly?,AnnaHufer,1611995684," Hello, I am a man. I think, in John 20:23 it clearly, says that disciples gained the ability to forgive sins. I think, there is also a verse that says that they gained the ability to cast out demons. Some disagree that what Jesus meant was that they should spread the gospel and give the chance to people to ask for forgiveness directly from Jesus. In my opinion that could be wrong, because if the disciples decide not to share the gospel with someone, that someone is not guilty because he/she has not heard/learnt the Truth. Since, the disciplines gained the ability to cast out demons, cant we assume that what Jesus meant with John 20:23 is that He gave the ability to his disciples to forgive sins. But if thats the case, then, if someone sins (insults someone due to anger, or entertain himself with some sexual thoughts) does not that put him into a danger of going to hell? (if in case 1 unrepented sin can lead to hell?) I think, confession to a priest is not done regulary. I think, they are specific dates and is like an appointment. 

 Lets say that someone has just, repented by confessing to a priest. and some hours later, he sins because he got angry with someone for example. Maybe he will need to wait for 1-2 days or even more to confess to a priest again. Does not that put him into a risk of going to hell?",OrthodoxChristianity
"Do churches have more or stricter rules than it really, needs?",AnnaHufer,1611995254," I can understand that skipping the main gatherin of the church could be a sin but what about the other days that the church has gatherings? For example, for the celebration of a Saint? Is it a sin if I skip those gatherins but attend only, church on Sunday? I am not sure if the Bible clearly condemns skipping church. I think, there is a verse that says not to neglect going to the gatherings but I am not sure if it condemns it as a sin. Going to church helps  your faith. Does the Bible clearly condemns it? It could be a sin but what about the other days that a church may have a ceremonty (to celebrate for a Saint for example)? Is it still, a sin if I attend church on Sundays but avoid going to other gatherings?

 Does the Bible say that we need to fast Friday and Wednesday? Does the Bible say that we need to fast for 40 days?

 All these seems like a burden to me. I can understand that someone should read the Bible, pray to God, repent, maybe attend church EVERY Sunday but is it necessary for someone to fast for 40 days? is it necessary to go to church every time the church has a gathering? (not only Sunday but other days too?)


 I think, Paul founded churches in order to spread the gospel and that churches had established these rules. But, since many years has passed since then, how we know that there has not been a misunderstanding? What if church has some more or stricter rules than it really needs? Do churches agree with each other? If churches do not agree with each other then, we can assume that easily, there could be a misunderstanding after so many years.

 That is why I am asking about Bible verses. Are there Bible verses that cleary say that skipping church gatherings (any day) is a sin? Does the Bible say that not fasting for 40 days is a sin? Can I have those verses?",OrthodoxChristianity

1) A girl talked about her loosing faith in Christ because she was doubting the Bible and wasn‚Äôt understanding it so i told her to look into the theology of Christianity, study its roots and see how deep out history goes, it‚Äôll help find answers and validate our Lords divinity. I gave her a few resources and prayed they would help. 
2) I was on instagram on a Christian meme page. Even tho it‚Äôs a meme page they sometimes do have informative posts and this one was ‚Äú Why Allah and God aren‚Äôt the same God using both the Quran and the Bible‚Äù I completely agreed with the post and as someone who‚Äôs studied both it was factually correct but i felt the need to comment basically saying, to not hate muslims just cause they have a different faith we don‚Äôt agree with and to not invade muslim spaces trying to start a debate/fight with the things they just learned. Most agreed or understood but there were a a few that didn‚Äôt understand what i meant or didn‚Äôt think that doing so would be harmful in anyway one saying ‚Äúspreading the truth isn‚Äôt promoting hate‚Äù and ‚Äúthis post doesn‚Äôt promote hate, did you even read it?!‚Äù.  I didn‚Äôt think of it until a muslim was in the comments trying to defend his faith, which i under as Christians do the same. Almost everyone, including the owner of the page, was making fun of him or being just rude in general so i felt the need to basically say ‚Äúhey as an arab Christian i can relate to others not understanding our faith, i want to apologize for the way others have been treating you. If you want to understand Christ for yourself look into the Hypostatic Union of Christ and study the theology, it helps understand our beliefs.‚Äù He appreciated my apology and was nice back, he didn‚Äôt mention if we would look into it but i prayed for him and told him i wish him nothing but the best in Jesus name and he liked my comment. 

ooh sorry this is long but, i just wanted to ask if i did it right or if i was too nice to anything. I obviously want to lead people to Christ but i don‚Äôt want my the love to overshadow the conviction.

"A Doubting and Confused Catholic (Mom, Wife, Convert). Long. Help and Lots of Questions.",px_alpha_omega,1611976677,"Hello there. 

Before I begin, I want to ask your grace and forgiveness for the likely length of the post, as well as any rambling contained within. Undoubtedly, I come here out of COVID and social distancing and all the other associated craziness, so I beg your pardon for what is likely to be a long and self-indulgent post in your community. 

I am a practicing Catholic, a convert of several years now. I'm a wife and a mom with a young family (all my children and my husband are baptized &amp; practicing Catholics). 

I've loved being Catholic and it has been one of the greatest joys of my life and an incredible means of better conforming myself to the will of the Father. After I converted, and up until *very* recently, I was sure I would die a Catholic.  I planned to have myself enrolled in the Brown Scapular this year, read St. John of the Cross, perhaps become a third order Dominican or Carmelite later in life, all that.  I pray the Rosary every day for quite a while now, I've got crucifixes all over my home, holy water, the whole nine yards. I was raised in a very dull mainline Protestant church and have absolutely loved being Catholic in comparison. 

Until I started listening to Jonathan Pageau within the last six weeks, apparently listening to too much of him, because now my world is starting to feel very rocked and I am extremely unsure of what to do now. 

Listening to Pageau, though he has never said this directly and this all my own impression and conjecture, I cannot help but be disturbed by a sense that while Catholicism has ""all the stuff"" that Orthodoxy does, it also has a lot of things that Orthodoxy does not have.... While this would not seem to be a problem on the face of it, because Catholicism does allow one to, within reason, choose what aspects of the Church that they wish to engage with (charismaticism, traditionalism, Marian apparitions, private revelations, etc.)  I am beginning to realize (again, my own realization stirred by listening to Pageau) that there may be a very deep problem with all these additions that undermine the sacramental communion itself.  In essence, it is seeming to me as if there are real and tangible spiritual benefits to members of the Orthodox communions because there is not quite so much ""fragmentation"" as has occurred the Catholic Church.

When I read this back, it seems all so academic and dry, but I cannot help but convey to you how almost world-shattering this realization has been to me.

I am just not sure where to go from here, and am looking for advice and feedback, especially from Catholics or former Catholics, on what to do, as well as answers to my many questions.

Why is this so earth-shattering? One, I feel a deep hunger now for what I now perceive to be the real communion, the communion that isn't so fragmented by all these modifications and additions throughout the centuries, the communion that has a much more holistic and meaningful message than my own. Two, this is problematic for me as my husband is more attached to Catholicism than I am now, and is not ready to consider Orthodoxy, though it would not be beyond the bounds of possibility for him. I really refuse to be in a different sacramental communion than my children and husband, and would not consider becoming Orthodox unless he would convert with me, too. Three, I am not sure what to do now given these two tensions. Four, and perhaps most important, I am very attached to all the rhythms of Catholic life that have undergirded my spiritual life and growth into the will of the Father, and feel unsure about the spiritual terrain that would be available to me as a lay Orthodox to continue my spiritual journey.  

I am no stranger to Orthodoxy. Over a decade ago, I attended an Orthodox Church for about a year. I've been to Vespers and Divine Liturgies aplenty, I've read Ware and Schmemann, Fr. Stephen Freeman, etc. My reasons for not converting then were more practical than anything else (if anything, when I look back on this time now, I was a dilettante more than anything else). While it has been some time, I would say I have a decent grasp on the basics of Orthodoxy, but it has always been a faith that has eluded me. Until Pageau -- I am beginning to feel as if I'm finally grasping a koan that has been beyond my mind for decades. 

So, without further ado, here are all my questions and concerns.

I will admit that I am hoping that you will tell me that I cannot have what I want, these are not the droids that I'm looking for. I really almost regret listening to Pageau because I was doing perfectly fine in my spiritual life and now I feel a huge apple cart that grounds me to the earth has been upset. Sigh. 

1. **Confession.** What is Orthodox confession like compared to Catholic confession? I know it is not anonymous (that is fine with me and actually preferable), but what is the structure of a confession like? In Catholicism, our confession is more like, ""I lied 3 times. I stole my boss' pencil once. I have been angry and prideful."" The motto is, ""Be brief, be blunt, be gone."" How does an Orthodox confession compare? How often does a practicing, serious lay Orthodox confess? A serious Catholic would probably confess once every two weeks to once a month.  
2. **Devotion to St. Michael.** I have a devotion to St. Michael the Archangel. I pray the Chaplet of St. Michael the Archangel on occasion and say the St. Michael the Archangel prayer (""St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our defense..."") multiple times throughout the day. Is there a comparable Orthodox devotion to St. Michael? 
3. **Devotion to the Divine Mercy.** I have often prayed the Divine Mercy Chaplet. The Chaplet stems from a private revelation (meaning lay Catholics are not obligated to believe the revelation) of Christ to St. Faustina, a Polish nun in the early 20th century. I considered my devotion to the Divine Mercy Chaplet but then realized that the Jesus Prayer seems to encapsulate the core of the devotion in fewer words.
4. **Private Revelations and Apparitions.** As I understand it, the Orthodox do not believe in post-apostolic revelations or apparitions of God, the angels, Christ, the Blessed Mother/Theotokos, etc.? If this is not the case, then could you outline for me what the parameters are?
5. **Eucharistic Miracles.** Do Orthodox have Eucharistic miracles like the Catholics claim where the host is bleeding, the wine tastes like blood, etc.? (I am aware of the Holy Fire.) 
6. **Devotion to the Theotokos**. As I mention, I have had a devotion to the Rosary. I know there is a ""Prayer Rule of the Theotokos"" but I am not able to find much on it. Is this prayed on a chotki / prayer rope that is used for the Jesus Prayer? Do many lay Orthodox pray this?
7. **Praying ""for"" Someone Else**. I will often tell people who ask for my prayers or people who I want to pray for, ""I'll pray a Rosary for you,"" or ""I'll do a novena for you/ your intention."" How is this done as an Orthodox Christian? Do you pray 100 Jesus Prayers ""for"" someone? Are there specific prayers you are using to pray for someone or do you use your own freeform prayer to pray for them? Is there something comparable to the structure of the novena where you can pray for a specific intention?
8. **Use of the Jesus Prayer as a Means to Salvation, and Other Prayers and Devotions Toward That End**. If you are a serious lay Orthodox, what devotions and practices and prayers are you using to help you toward your own salvation? I had hoped, as Catholic, that the Chaplet of St. Michael, my devotion to him, my devotion to the Rosary, enrollment in the Brown Scapular, praying more novenas, etc. would help grow my spiritual life further in Christ, which is very important to me. How do you do it as an Orthodox? Do you use the Jesus Prayer? It seems that there are very specific rules for praying the Jesus Prayer, though. How have you found your ""tools"" helpful toward your spiritual growth? 
9. **Adoration**. As a Catholic, I have loved Adoration (in the pre-COVID times that I got to enjoy it!) and I would miss this very much as an Orthodox. Why do Orthodox not practice Adoration? 
10. **Daily Mass**. I have loved the idea of participating in Daily Mass at some point in the future as a Catholic, to commune with Christ more frequently. But it does not seem that this is a practice with the Orthodox. Is this for practical reasons or theological ones that the Eucharist is only offered on Sunday? Could you elaborate on this?
11. **Tollhouses**. I have read stories about the tollhouses, and they completely flip me out. Do the Orthodox believe all the dead (I suppose since the time of Christ) go through the tollhouses? I know we Catholics have Purgatory, and perhaps I've been a little too careful to skip those stories, but what I have read of Purgatory seems a little bit more straightforward (punishment, flames, etc.) than this odd, bizarre, fun-house-of-horror tollhouse perspective on life after death. 

Here is another set of questions about what I should do now.

I believe I should go back to reading Ware and Schmemann and other Orthodox authors and the Fathers. I don't want to pressure my husband into becoming Orthodox. I have already started praying for his conversion if that is the Lord's will for us. 

I have not participated in the sacramental life of the Catholic Church in any way for quite some time because of COVID. I am hopeful we may be able to return to ""normal life"" by the summer, but I am not quite sure what I should do if I continue feeling the way I do. I do not want to excommunicate myself from the sacramental communion that my husband is in -- that feels very wrong to me. I do not know, however, to what extent I should go to Confession, partake in the Eucharist with the Catholic Communion, or even devote myself to my post-schism saints like St. Theres√© of Lisieux, to whom I have a devotion. I have continued to pray the Rosary, but given what I have read of the Orthodox perspective, I am trying not to ""meditate"" on the Rosary anymore (as in, imagining scenes in my head) and focus simply on the meaning of the words, though it is hard because one is supposed to ""meditate"" on the Mystery of the decade. I am instead trying to do this a little bit more intellectually, but it has been tricky because I've been using my imagination for so long.  I am also devoting myself to the Jesus Prayer simply by praying it when I can (no connection to breath, really or my heartbeat, just prayer).  Does anyone have any thoughts or experience of their own? I almost wish I were Protestant now, because it would seem easier to be a ""third order Orthodox"" and participate somewhat in life as an ""Orthodox"" without going to an Orthodox Church, but belonging to a sacramental communion like the Roman Catholic Church, to which I have made a number of promises, yet desiring to join another sacramental communion, makes things feel very confusing for me. 

If you have made it this far, I thank you so much for your time and consideration and for allowing me to post and ask questions here.",OrthodoxChristianity

Is Christian Apologetics frowned upon/sinful in Orthodoxy?,Ortho-Apologia,1611896425,"Clearly, there is a role for reason in our everyday lives. God didn‚Äôt give us the ability for nothing.

Yet cannot our rationality ascertain certain things that pertain to the truth of the Christian religion in general and Orthodoxy in particular?

On the subject of abortion in orthodox christianity,borinqueno1171,1611855601,"I understand that abortion is considered murder and forbidden in orthodoxy, I understand the position of being pro life and wanting every human being on earth to have a truly equal and equitable opportunity in life to have a comfy life, but the issue is that life isn't equitable or truly equal, life is horrible and it's full of more pain and suffering and dispair than pleasure and economic opportunity and prosperity, most people are not born into wealth and opportunity even in the United States and there's too many forces beyond our control that essentially determines our abilities to have a normal functioning family and good education and passing and being able to get into and afford college and getting and keeping a comfy job. Don't you think the most reasonable position for abortion an orthodox christian may take would that if the person will not be guaranteed a good life? Why would you force a human into a world where he or she will experience my more pain than pleasure? 

To be quite honest and I understand what I am about to type is extremely controversial and would shock even the most liberal people on earth, I feel that if humanity isn't progressing medically, environmentally, socially, technologically, educationally, or even economically that all men and women (even children) should be non surgically sterilized (tie the tubes and women and vasctomy for men, they can be reversed easily) and abort every fetus from all pregnant women to prevent a potential person from experiencing the pains of life that he or she would very likely not receive relief from and go into depression and contemplate suicide. If humanity still cannot progress these 6 institutions and cannot enhance the quality of human life on earth, I can't see any reason for the human species to continue and would rather see humanity exterminated through failure to reproduce from the humanely and professionally done non surgical sterilization on all of humanity.

Free will and Hell - Why free will is not a sufficient response,MarysDowry,1611837362,"In light of the responses to the recent blog I shared, I'd like to share some thoughts on free will which I hope will cut past the exegetical questions and get to the heart of the issue. 

For the sake of this discussion I will grant that free will exists and that God desires to not violate this gift, to the extent that he places it in high enough regard to assent to even the most illogical of whims. My aim here is to show why the free will defense is totally incapable of providing a sufficient response to the 'moral argument for universalism'. 

To quickly summarise the moral argument for universalism:

God created freely, without restraint or need, with perfect foreknowledge and sovereignty. Given these facts, Gods choice to create beings who he knows will be consigned to hell for eternity is an indefensible evil and renders Gods love incoherent. 

The common response seems to be that free will provides a sufficient reason for why God can be moral, whilst accepting this ultimate loss of souls in his desire to create free beings. I think this is plainly false for a few reasons. Again for the sake of discussion I will grant every majority position here, that the will is solidified at death, that one needs to freely assent in this life, that God cannot use force to change someones will and that they cannot be coerced.

Even given all these facts, there is a very simple response. It rests on these key, well attested facts:

1) Gods foreknowledge of future events does not negate free-will

2) Gods choice to actualise any particular world over another possible world does not negate free-will

3) Gods free choice to create or not create any particular being does not negate creaturely free-will

The result of these 3 simple facts is that it would be entirely possible even under a reality of non-violable free will for God to create a universe in which no one is damned, simply by not creating any beings he knew would be damned. This would not be a violation of free-will as all beings who existed were entirely unviolated in their free choices. 

A similar alternative argument is that given an infinite possible number of worlds, God could simply choose to actualise the world in which everyone freely chooses salvation (or wherein the fall does not even occur). 

Given the fundamental Orthodox argument about the nature of evil, that it is entirely unnecessary to Gods creation, there is no conceivable argument which would necessitate God creating beings who are rebellious. To argue such would be to argue that the presence of evil is a necessary component of Gods creative vision. So therefore we conclude that it was entirely unnecessary for God to create those beings who he knew were going to rebel. Also for the second argument, if its impossible for God to create a world in which free beings do not choose evil and are therefore damned, I don't see how we can continue to hold that evil is an accidental part of reality. By necessity it must be possible given the Orthodox understanding of evil that a world free from evil was possible and actualisable by God, if he so desired to do so. 

The only conclusion I can feasibly see here is that those who were created with foreknowledge of their damnation were made simply for the purpose of their damnation. What we would essentially be arguing here is a kind of calvinism, where God willing chooses to create people destined for hell out of totally arbitrary desire to do so. Quite self-evidently I'd hope, this is not in keeping with the scriptural witness to Gods love.

Perhaps I have missed a fundamental premise which renders this argument incoherent, but I do not see it.",OrthodoxChristianity

God has called us, not to the modern ""heaven"" of repose and sleep, but to the full and deifiying glory of the sons of God; and if we, whom our God thinks worthy to receive it, reject this call, ‚Äîthen better for us the flames of Hell, the torment of that last and awful proof of man's high calling and of God's unquenchable Love for all men, than the nothingness to which men of small faith, and the Nihilism of our age, aspire. Nothing less than Hell is worthy of a man, if he be not worthy of Heaven""

From *Nihlism: The Root of the Revolution of the Modern Age* by Fr Seraphim Rose

I think the most important idea that people get wrong, which leads them to taking a universalist standpoint, is the idea that hell is punishment. It isn't punishment, it's actually mercy. If God is all of reality, if He's the only thing that is sufficient unto itself, then to be without Him is to simply stop existing (to live without existence is to stop existing). However, God loves us so much that He continues to sustain us even as we curse and contradict Him, even as we strive towards nonexistence. He loves us too much to let us destroy ourselves",OrthodoxChristianity

I want to have a relationship with a transgender person and don't understand why this is a sin.,twitterisawesome,1611647148,"I am a straight man and for the last several months, I have been developing a close friendship with a transgender woman. This is a person who was born a man but identifies as a woman.

This is the first transgender person I have ever interacted with. And previously, I always took the idea that transgender people are that way because they have the brains of the opposite sex with a huge grain of salt. However, communicating with this person is exactly like communicating with any other woman. They strongly value family, romance, children, and love. 

Furthermore, we have many similar interests like camping, watching the night sky, prank tv shows, bollywood movies and we can always easily make each other laugh. She has taken the time to get to know me and support me in a way my ex-wife never did and I do the same for her. 

I feel myself falling for this person and nothing about it seems like a homesexual relationship because I am attracted to this person's femininity. 

I am really struggling to see where the sin is the relationship is built on love and respect instead of lust, and when the attraction is between two people who identify as opposite genders. 

Sure, the simple legalistic answer is that sex is only supposed to happen within the confines of a marriage where procreation is possible...but that seems to imply that the primary purpose of a marriage is procreation, which of course is not true. Marriage is about binding yourself to another person in a way that forces you to learn, grow and become a better person. Most marriage vows don't even mention children.

Gospel of John,Vasilisonofspiro,1611630430,"Hello I have a question about the Gospel of John. I admit everything in that gospel is theologically accurate my question is do you guys think that the unique parts of that gospel reflect the historical Jesus. What I am talking about is Christ‚Äôs language describing himself as the I AM and saying that he and his father are one. 

In Mark Christ seems very secretive about his true identity but in John it seems like it‚Äôs all he can talk about. In addition John is also the youngest and most overtly theological. St John May have had theological motives to add in some phrases while true may not be traceable to the real Christ. Modern scholarship seems pretty sold on the fact that John may not be necessarily true. 

I know we should accept scholarly analysis with a large helping of salt however I find the logic behind skepticism of John rather strong. Simply put the Jesus in John is very different from the Synoptics.

Conversion...,EscapeInteresting882,1611627776,"Hello,

I'm writing as a woman, a mother in my 30s and I'm very, very interested in Orthodox Christianity. I've been exploring Christianity and felt close to rejoining the Catholic church after 15-17 years away. I recently found out about Orthodox Christianity and from very early exploration, I am really excited and hopeful.  I have many questions, but I also am eager to get right with the Lord so I also don't want to hang around tossing the idea around. 

I apologize if this post is sort of all over the place but if anyone knows the answers to these questions, any pointers would be very much appreciated!

I am married to an atheist man. We are not married in the Catholic church, but I believe would be open to allowing us to get our marriage blessed in the church. In the Roman Catholic church, this would allow our marriage to be honored in the body of Christ and it would allow me to have the potential to be able to receive communion. Is there anything similar in Orthodox Christianity? Would my being married to an unbeliever prevent me for participating fully in the faith(the sacraments)?

Also...this may be a strange question, but what could I expect from orthodox confession? I sinned A LOT (serious sin) while I had fallen away from the Lord üò≠üò≠. In Catholicism, these grave sins are forgiven in confession and after reconciling with the Lord it is considered that I am able to be welcome at church and receive communion.  Is there anything more scary about Orthodox confessions? Can I expect a possiblity of a priest hearing my confession and saying ""that's too awful"" or ""penance will be 5 years"" or something like that? 

What would the church ask me in educating my children in the faith? I obviously want to guide them to God, but my husband would simply never agree to let me start taking them to Divine Liturgy right off the bat, and he would want a chance to teach them what he believes/doesn't believe, etc.

Why the Orthodox Church is Different,feeble_stirrings,1611610566,"I've been listening to a new series of [talks](https://myocn.net/acquiring-an-orthodox-christian-mind/) by Dr. Jeannie Constantinou that has been really good so far (only 2 episodes at this point, but more to come). There's a part in the 2nd episode where she answers the question of why we say that we are the early Church and what differentiates Orthodoxy from other kinds of Christianity, and her answer was stated in a way that really struck me.   


When the disciples were with Christ for those three years, He wasn't just passing along to them concepts, teaching or doctrine. They were learning a new way to think and view God, the world, everything. After the Resurrection, when the Apostles began to spread the Faith, they did the same thing. They spent time in the communities they found themselves and imparted that same mindset (phronema); not just doctrine or an intellectual framework, but a way of thinking and a manner of being. It's that mindset that continues to be passed down within the Church that makes Orthodoxy truly different.   


I'm probably not doing it justice, you can hear it straight from the source on episode 2, around [28:29](https://www.facebook.com/MyOCN/videos/936274390239200/?t=1710) (about 5 minutes). I highly recommend at least checking out this portion.",OrthodoxChristianity

Burst water mains, record high and dangerous winds when I needed to travel, and a whole mess of things that somehow manage to go wrong like a wall mounted cabinet literally happening to collapse into me while I walked past it, and a brand new refrigerator dying while I was gone and wasting a month's worth of food. And I kid you not this has all transpired in the past 14 days. And there are even more things I've gone without mentioning.

At this point I'm starting to hate life, God, and all people I come across in my daily life. It feels as though I'm fighting against God to not perish and not be tortured endlessly. It feels like each big moment in my life - escaping homelessness/generational poverty as a child, getting a college degree, finding the love of my life, and going to graduate school have not been because of God, but very much so in spite of what He has wanted for me.

The Church feels foreign and hostile to me now. I was taught that God was love, I was taught that I wouldn't be alone in the war against the flesh and that God, the saints, etc. would be by my side. It honestly feels like the opposite now. The church and in personal prayer use to be where I was happiest, and now it feels distant, and that engaging with the Church is only hurting me. And I honestly don't know if there is any undoing the damage that has been done... if I can ever feel as though God loves me again. If I can ever feel as though I'm not fighting against God to just live another day.

Any thoughts, advice, book recommendations would be appreciated. Because as much as I feel disconnected and abandoned, I want to know why, and beyond that there is something tiny and fleeting in me that wants to draw closer to God.

What is your opinion about the Holy Light?,SebastianGDW,1611585995,"There have been tons of mentions about the Holy Light and how it would be a fraud.
While it is believable that the Holy Light/Fire would be true..There are also reasons to,let's say, not believe in it.
Firstly...There aren't any biblical references to it(obviously), and it's been first mentioned in the 4th century.While that doesn't really prove anything, what I wanted to point out is that since then,there have been  quite some ""opinions"" about it, some of them even being from orthodox personalities,and it has even caused conflicts inside the Orthodox Church itself.

As an orthodox myself, I'll agree, it is quite questionable why the patriarch needs to go by himself insode, and people waiting outside.Now...I understand the ""mystery"" aspect,and I also know the patriarch is inspected closely as to not bring any source of fire with him..But still..I find it a little suspicious.

Some historians mentioned that at one point, the Jerusalem Church admitted to the turks that the Holy Fire is just lit from a ""sacred candle which never stops burning"" hidden behind an icon (the reasoning for their ""confession"" was that the turk pasha said that if he comes there and the miracle is fake,he'll take all their wealth).

Personally...I might be mistaking here,but I don't know if I care that much whether it is a miracle or not...I say this because the Holy Light is not the centre of Orthodoxy,and the Orthodox Christianity certainly doesn't revolve around it. Even if it's true,even if it isn't, there is a MUCH more important miracle...The Holy Communion.

What does really intrigue me is...If the Holy Light,somehow, is just a fraud(and let's pray to God it isn't)...Then does it mean that SO MANY patriarchs since the 4th century have been lying?You know how awful it would be if it'd be real?

The more I think about this,the more I want the Holy Fire to be a truth...And as a consequence to this...I prefer to believe that it is,indeed, a real miracle.

What do orthodox churches say about transgender people?,borinqueno1171,1611529966,"I know that orthodox churches are explicitly not pro gay or bi or lesbian, I understand being against those from an orthodox christian perspective.

How do Orthodox Christians explain aniconism in Judaism?,SeniorNebula,1611501355,"Hello all,

I'm Jewish and I mean this as a friendly question - I have no interest in converting to Orthodox Christianity and certainly no interest in converting any of you out of it. 

I was reading about the use of icons in Orthodox worship. I understand it's not idolatry, that the icon essentially functions as a material aid to focus the prayer toward G-d. That's neat, and the icons are often transcendently beautiful in a totally striking way. I think Orthodox Christians should be very proud of your wonderful tradition.

My question is: considering that we contemporary Jews and you the Orthodox Christians both retain practices from Second Temple Judaism, how do Orthodox Christians account for the aniconism which has been present in Judaism for, to my knowledge, its entire lifetime? 

The reason I am so fascinated by your icons is that Jews do nothing like this - we simply do not produce sacred art of our prophets to aid us in worship. To the best of our knowledge, we have never done this, corresponding to our Bible's absolutely vicious and instant anti-idolatry, which produced a strong tendency against sacred art of human beings and animals. 

I can think of a few different Orthodox responses here:

1. Jewish civilization during and before the Second Temple period *did* use icons. Jews stopped using icons as an adaptation to the loss of the Second Temple, Pharisee political rule, or some other historical development, but icons were a natural part of ancient Jewish worship in basically the way Orthodox Christians use them now.

2. Jewish civilization before and during the Second Temple period did *not* use icons, but the incarnation and works of Jesus as the Messiah made the use of icons a new and important worship method/sacrament for his followers, like the Lord's Supper or baptism.

3. Icons were not used by Jews before Jesus or by Christians immediately afterwards; they were a practice that developed within Orthodox Christianity over time for reasons of culture, geography, and theology which can basically be understood sociologically. Jews were doing their own thing and either didn't pay attention to this new practice or didn't like it.

I'm sure that's not all the options, I just tried to think through all the answers I could think of. I'm pretty sure it's #3 but could be #2 - I don't think it's #1. Jewish aniconism throughout the ages is pretty well-documented. People might point to the Dura-Europos synagogue, a beautiful 3rd-centuty synagogue which was covered in biblical art. But scholars were so surprised because it's so crazy to find that kind of art in a synagogue of any age, and they found a church next door that was painted in the same way at the same time, and opened right before the synagogue started painting. So I think this is actually evidence that Jews experimented with sacred/educational religious art in this style after learning it from Christians. 

TL;DR Orthodox Christians see icons as an intrinsic part of the faith, do you see it as a post-Jesus development or do you think Jews before Jesus used icons in a similar way?",OrthodoxChristianity

Orthodoxy in Iran?,vladgo3,1611496164,"So recently I met this girl from Iran. She is Muslim only in name.

At the end of our discussion she told me that ""I made her think about religion like nobody else has in the near past"", which made me think that *just maybe* I actually convinced her to be more open to the idea of a conversion.

Theological Confusion,pixelpilgrim,1611463125,"I'm a recent convert to the church, I've only been attending for a couple months but I'm trying to learn as much as I can so that I may better approach this new part of my life. Something has been confusing me I've learned that God is outside of Space and Time and that makes sense that the creator would be more than the created. If that is true then how could God intervene in time without disrupting free will. If God sees all of time from a perspective outside of time then he would see all possible choices and all possible outcomes and all the changes his interventions would cause. So all the interventions in reality would all have happened and been destined to happen since the beginning of time.

Please pray for me and others who feel forgotten,asherart,1611463079,"It is easy, especially here in rural America, to feel ""outside"" of this faith.

It is a very large church because it is one of the only churches in the State I live in. I have not been there in a very long time due to the pandemic, but even when this pandemic is over the church is so far away and so large that I am hardly a drop in the bucket when I do attend. I have emailed the priest a few times but he is extremely busy due to the size of the church and he never responds to me. 



So, the best I can do is really just try to keep up with my reading and do my daily/nightly prayers. I've been able to keep up with this for the entire period I've been inquiring at this church, but to what end? I've made no progress in my spiritual life depsite the reading and praying, I've just gone in circles. I have no one to help me or listen to me. I have endured many hardships in my life recently, and usually hardships are a blessing from God, they give us the opportunity to grow in humility and draw closer to God as our faith withstands the struggle. But God feels so far away from me that it feels like my suffering has been in vain, and it leaves me feeling frustrated and empty.


I don't know what to do really, I'm considering giving up, maybe someday I'll be able to move close by to a smaller church or something.

 I know I must not be the only one going through this exact situation, especially these days. If you are also struggling with this let me know and I will pray for you.

Creativity and (non-liturgical) arts,TimeSculpterer,1611432853,"Hello everyone,

I'm a quite recent member of the Orthodox Church, being chrismated on last April.

I consider myself to be a quite creative person, and creativity and arts play a large role in my life. It also did play a great role (and still does) regarding my own way into the Church and the Orthodox lifestyle. As a catechumen I was inspired by many authors, actors etc. who had converted to Orthodoxy and their biographies were a big source of motivation for me in my own converting process.

One thing, that I would especially point out, are the filmographies of two film directors: Andrei Tarkovsky and Terrence Malick. I consider both of them to be deeply Christian artists (especially with Tarkovsky being Russian Orthodox) and I highly, highly recommend both of them to anyone interested in cinema with Christian themes and symbolism. Both of those men and their lives work mean a great deal to me.

So: as a new member of the church I am trying to figure out my own relationship to non-liturgical arts. As I said, art (literature, music, cinema etc.) means a great deal to me. It really does. However, I sometimes feel troubled about listening to secular music, reading books by secular authors etc. Maybe this could be a thing with ex-Protestants? (myself included) 

I feel that it is really difficult to me to live without creativity, but I wouldn't want to compromise my interest in the arts with my relationship to the Church and Orthodox values. One of my dreams is to write for example non-liturgical music/poetry/etc., which still contains Christian symbolism and themes.

Anyways, this is just my two cents for the topic. Would love to hear some comments or ideas about how an Orthodox Christian should approach being creative and interested in secular arts. Thank you for reading!",OrthodoxChristianity

1. Is it allowed to be proud of anything (your country)? 

2. Is it allowed to eat a lot in order to achive something (body building)

3. Is it allowed to name art (music, books, paintings etc..) after pagan/spiritual things? The music has no spiritual meaning for us. Only the name of the music or the storys in the books about imaginary gods/forces. Again we don't belive in that just use it as art.

4. Is it allowed to say ""Gott mit uns!"" (God with us) or ""In the name of god"". It seems wrong to me but Idk..

5. Is it allowed to swear. I saw in some countires in the Military they swear on the bible, is this allowed? With swear I don't mean bad words I mean like when you say ""I swear I don't know"".

6. Is there any good Shop for Christians. Where they sell crosses, maybe even from a moanistary that would be helpful so I can give a bit of Support. Since I don't really have anything so maybe there is a good place for crosses etc..

Saint Apostle Paul on Love ‚Ä†,patiencetruth,1611425687,"The Greatest Gift

Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.

Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.

When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.

And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

Luke 8:10

And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.

Look up the context I'm modifying and getting bored. I don't lie. I don't like saying things twice. And it's tricky balancing people being adequately upset and chastised with not quitting reading and putting things together for them and others. Patience is my worst virtue. 
This is the true start for understanding the parables, (continued at bottom [a1] ) 

Here's the literary hook so you'll suffer through my poor grammar and discarded sense of prescribed imposed literary theory and practice to the end hopefully. I'll pray for you. The solution is the light on the hill for finding your path. It'll cut through the fog. 

I'll aid you through considering Matthew 25. Combined. 
There were 10 virgins. The current disclosed virgin traits are naivety. There were five ""fools"" and ""five"" wise. The fools expected kindness and compassion from the other greedy virgins. They wanted them to share. They were foolish for the means through which they wanted them to share. They expected oil which they had not brought but if they were wise at all they would have expected a share of the excess of light from the ""wise"". The bridegroom tarred on purpose. He waited till midnight, ""at midnight"". In this section of the teaching capital L is used. This bridegroom is the actual Lord not the untrue king in the subsequent talent and kingdom parable. So the ""wise"" would prove their foolishness and evil. Rather than forgiving their mild foolishness and sharing their excess light from lanterns they were not requested to bring, they cast out their companions. They were evil and intended to trick the Lord. The next lord requires no tricking. The one who gave the talents. He knew who and what he was which I'll explain further down. The Lord needed the foolish to trick the wise. So they could glean the excess wasted light without succumbing to the sin of the wise, putting themselves at risk shopping by themselves in the middle of the night, and committing any sin. They only had lanterns probably. Currently only the fools have hope. He sent them away to wait for the sum of man for their second chance. Or wait third chance second source. Duh. Because their second chance with Jesus would have been to keep trying rather than half quitting and waiting to maybe be forgiven my the son of man on earth, Luke 5:24. They chose to gamble on the possibility of being forgiven by the son of man while on earth. They job'd (combinatory human and God inflicted sufferings) themselves. So he denied them which to Jesus is denying faith and the relationship and the person. But he's loving and understanding so he'll forgive them anyways in death. But the wise who do be cruel receive theirs. And that's secret. 

Out of ten zero were truly accepted. And as for the wise he let them in but why would he marry any of them. And these were virgins who whether by some combination of virgin traits foolishness, wisdom, and wise cruelty were all rejected. But the foolish had potential for goodness because they conceded without fighting especially because they were fools. They turned the other cheek and walked away.
Whizch I'll explain now. It's how you act when you don't know how to fight without sin. Some fun implications. If there's more than one person you're turning the cheek too you can spit at them as you turn your cheek back and forth. It's rare to be able to spit at someone and walk away. I'm choosing to stand. If you turn the cheek once you have the potential to walk away right after because you have the momentum of turning but on your terms. You can chastize with your eyes. If you want to mess with them you can keep spinning in circles till you fall over. And there's generally more. Be creative kind and careful. 
Then Jesus leads us into a new section. Being a servant of a rich profiteering master. I'll briefly attempt to explain profit to us retards(completely lacking in thought in some aspect or through combination completely lacking in at least 2, normalize this) [p3]
Where does profit come from? It's always theft either from God or man. Profiting from nature rather than from (and yes I am giving you an extremely easy puzzle you can prove yourselves. I'm not writing a book yet) just gleaning the excess of it such as any _true sustainable resource_ (completely and near permanently renewable, without intervention such as fertilizing or watering for plants for instance. The oceans need that stuff in a natural form so we can be healthy. This is in genesis by the way. No hints). If you make profit in any form from something by degrading it with no way to permanently restore it you're going to hell. Consider where money always comes from at the base. It's abuse and neglect of people and nature to always maximize profit. Consider erosion, the minimum wage, the necessity of the stock market, the service economy!, and inflicted suffering, insulin. People literally dying from this stuff. So people can have their new phones and cheeseburgers. While they gamble on stock. This one gets a book.
The ""wise"" lord traveled and stole as he instructed his servents to do while he was gone. They all received the same amount they had started with from others with the same talent. Which means they ""traded"" with people of equal talent exactly once. If it was coercion they would have kept going. If it was trading services they would have kept going not that that one really makes sense anyways. So what's left? Theft is excluded because they ""traded"". So what's left gambling. How else would they double their profit. Well what's left? If they were excellent they could keep going till someone quit. But they only made that much and that was the whole time he was gone. So what's left. Cheating with the biggest bet they could make. Which after being caught they were only able to do once. Because it was an unfair evil gimmick. That everyone would realize after losing to. This is the interpretation of the direct work and word of Jesus as He intended. Britches. Ah but wait another possibility the talents corresponded to the number of talents at this form of theft. So the math checks out with it being 1:1 with gambling but in smaller bets. Starting to make sense? Here's some proof. The capital L's are switched in this section. Examine it use your brain. Ah now let's examine the final talent. It should be obvious. He was afraid to profit on profit with just his one talent. Read it Luke 25:24-30. Would the same son of God who preached the sermon on the mount endorse this example like this. Keep going with it. 


[p3] So they were given another chance. Consider the sermon on Mount olives. It's about second chances. It's about Jesus's forgiveness. But he regrets having to forgive the foolish evil wise ones. And depending on the kind of evil wise peson. They're not actually people. They're beasts. What even are peple who lead the blind into ditches. 

Chains of the blind can be lead like sheep in a line hopefully not off a cliff. Following a shepherd. I'm. Not. A. Shepherd. Deep down you already know what I am

Luke 23:34 

Hey Simon 


Well this was in Luke so I obviously started with Luke.  Of course God would leave us with the beginning of the start and the immediate continuation of the puzzle in the same place. 

Then you follow order of operations for parable locations and visuals. 

I'll paint and release it all at some point. 

Briefly the log in the eye is a swamp or a pond depending on your wisdom and sight. If people try to pull it out with their own hands they risk dropping more in. The hands around the swamps are the trees. Consider pictures of standing dead trees in swamps. Consider the ecosystems. Do some research. I let mine decompose and settle while ensuring the borders were clean to prevent more falling in and give me further sight. But it's lonely. 
I've chosen to have one living good fruit tree until I sow more seeds. So I choose to wait to be friends with those with sight. 

So we start with Genesis but I'm skipping that for now because it's exceptionally harder and more deviscive. People need to have faith that there's more than meets the eye to the Bible and there's always more. It's the living word of God duh. 

The parables I'm explaining initially deal with the connectedness of man with his chosen environments, the home, the vineyard, the land, the weather, neighbor. and they're connected with many things. My first key was science particularly chemistry and biology as well as Bible study obviously. The necessity of science to understand the Bible is literally spoken by God in genesis and job. Do you understand? 
Further on we have primarily the kingdom, the state, the stranger, the wilderness, the earth, and the son of man. 

We'll start with the foundation because it's lame and easy. You don't make a foundation you find what God left. This'll be helpful for environmental restoration. And I'd you find one by a river it's even better. Self evidenced. 

Before we actually start consider Luke 5:36-39. Consider the context of reborn faith. Would a rent garment have no value and need to be tossed? Of course not. You repair it in your own way and keep going. To avoid waste and relatedly suffering you would keep the new and the old garment and switch when you were comfortable with the new. But what if the old garment is irreparable? (Consider the next paragraph). You would have to repair it with the new which would ruin both, permanently. So repair your garment or switch. But if you call yourself a Christian try following Jesus. 
Consider the intoxicating effects of old wine. Your old ways are corrupt in the wrong system. You could add water to it but you'd still be a drunk. You prefer the wine crafted from that which you did not sow. (if it's ""old"" wine of course you didn't sow it) To be shown the potential of new wine and decide to mix it or discard the new is reprehensible. Especially when you can sow and reap it yourself for once. Ever. 


=(post boredom note) 

Luke 5:31-32. These should be combined in teaching about them. Jesus is and was here for sick sinners. But he understood no one was whole. 

Jesus said to live it up while they were whole and with them. Then he told them to fast when he was taken away. 

The Luke 5:36 parable is a combination one. Besides what I've already mentioned. This is the one and only time I want to say that. In this referential instance it's about the plans for his life. And while I'm considering it a sign to others hmhhmgmhn jews that he did not intent to trash their religion. 

Luke 6:3-4
Jesus has a suggestion requests for the son of man's definition of sabbath work which is to not discriminate based on priests and people. Which probably means that A. Paid priests should not occupationaly preach on the sabbath while telling others not to work. And that you should be able to eat food cooked that day especially if you've been fasting because fasting is not resting. Whenever I get bored I'm just gonna say there's always more. 


Luke 6:9.this is a meme. It wasn't resting but he had scarcity of time like all of us and a lot to do so he messed with them by saying what he did as work was good but their work was evil. Consider hypocrisy. 


Luke 6:20-22

This is for peoples who are fasting and waiting and not participating in the profit theft gamble system waiting for the son of man. And then what would happen after he comes. Seems like thisll do it but I'll keep going. 

Consider every Luke and Matthew instance of son of man and the contexts. 

Well

Luke 6:27-38

This is the part where he switched to speaking to the people who could only heare. But were at least partially blind in the relevant way ie for people with no reading comprehension or the subsequent critical thinking. It's a chain. Up next is seeing and then understanding. He made the rest of the sermon really easy so I'm not going to talk about it unless I reference specific things. It's also the moral key for analyzing his teachings. These are the standards he almost lived up to. By no fault of his own. He was the son of God. Some of these were self evidently unattainable. Not a fan of mentioning this but the upcoming keys are 23, 27
30 is worth mentioning. You'll die doing this one. In this system we suffer. If people bug me I'll quit try to keep them from bugging me. I'm just a guy a little childish at times. 
38 is the opposite of the talent parable. Consider hypocrisy. 

This is painfully boring. Comment things you want me to work on. First top level comment stays I won't check anything else. Probably ever. I'll need some agree disagree voting for this one. 


Luke 6:39. Ugh yeah they're blind but they can hear and walk. Jesus would have said if they were deaf as well plus he would never talk about blind deaf people falling in ditches. Think about wandering and listening. 
For awhile I'm switching to giving the always more keys. 
40. No one is perfect not even a master sans Jesus. Who you could be like if you follow his teachings exactly keeping going from what I've said. You'll never surpass the person leading you but a great master will and has conceded to perfection. 
41. Uncover this one on your own. Consider Minnesota. 
42. Casting it out leaves shards. Which you have to be patient with or have a very delicate hand for. 
43. Hypocrites are automatically bad. 
44. Bad trees suck more than bad apples. 
45. People tell you their fruit in speech for actions see how they respond in kind. 



Just kidding hypocrite. 


46. Is he really your Lord? Or are you trying to be a master. To abuse original sin and profit on Jesus's forgiveness. 
47. Effort without works is fruitless. Not even a bad fruit. Your home and orchard will be washed away. 

Yeah I quit going in order. 

Actually I quit entirely I can't do this without help. Water. 


How do I communicate balance when I'm positive people need to go straight to extremes. They need the light but not to be burned alive and forced into their pits till I die. 





Now for you Lutheranism leaning people out there. The proof. Fuck off. 

And the catholics. You guys just made stuff up to feel better about your incomplete and inferior effort. 

To both of you. Do better. The world will end without you. 

Non denominational = not poggers






Methodology. I wrote and confirmed. 




([a1] )Jesus' teachings and statements!, and his story are all partially or fully misunderstood by the plurality of Christians. So I decided to solve it. Someone had to to keep us from floundering around in cluelessness!, seemingly hypocritical teachings!, abuse by the world, and sin. I'm Alec Bednar of Columbus Ohio and formarly Dallas Texas and I have no intention to stop. Help if you choose to care and discard your former insecurity and vanity. Permanently through faith sourced in seeing and understanding. 

Luke 15:5 ""and when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing"" 

Here's where we have to start. Consider the parables particularly mattew 25. And genesis stewardship. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_J-ODVl9Omg

Consider bandages on holes left by leeches. 


I'll provide more in 1 day. 

Consider the implications on Jesus's life death and resurrection. With all of it. How would he feel. Would he forgive the sin of someone who having faith in original sin's total inevitability and inescapability and then combined it with the belief that he would instantly forgive all sins with the barest amount of effort? Of course not. Why? That's not love its enabling sin. I'll provide more soon. Do better or his kingdom on earth will finish ending. Consider the fact that revelations is full of beasts. What are beasts? Well what makes us human. Knowledge of good and evil. Figure it out.

Now my advice. Figure it out do better. End of eden is our past present and projected future. Fix it. Actually try. I'll quit if no one fixes and saves nature. 

Personally I've discarded my wealthy upbringing, became disabled and partially homeless. Try being the least of these and thusly the most of these. Like the 1 talent man. Because only when you're the least of these can you be the most. You should understand by now. Don't lose to fear of suffering cyclically. You should understand by now.",OrthodoxChristianity

The magician who became a monk,leon1271,1611311878,"January 22, today celebrates Saint Anastasios the Persian the Holy Martyr, the magician who became a monk, an ardent confessor and a glorious martyr of Christ.

*Processing img c1exvp5x3vc61...*

 

Among the seventh choirs of the saints and martyrs of the Orthodox Church, the honored Saint Anastasios the Persian, held on January 22, holds a prominent position. This glorious and multi-valued holy martyr of the 7th AD. century, after knowing Christ, abandoned wealth and positions, put on the solitary figure, openly confessed his Christian faith and sealed his earthly life with his glorious martyrdom.

&amp;#x200B;

Saint Anastasios came from the village of Razih in the province of Rasnuni in Persia and lived in the years of the Persian king Khosrow II (590-680). His noble father was named Bab and he was a famous magician . That is why his son, who before being baptized and named Anastasios was called Mangoudat, attended the famous school of magicians, founded by his father, to be equal to him in magic. As an adult, he enlisted in Hosroes' army and in the Order of the Tyrones.

&amp;#x200B;

In 614 King Chosroes captured Jerusalem and kidnapped the Holy Cross of the Lord in Persia. The miraculous fame of the Holy Cross had spread so widely in Persia that this sacred symbol of Christianity aroused Mangoodat's interest in learning about the Christian religion. Pious Christians undertook to inform him of the greatness of the Christian faith. This fact motivated him to know the mystery of the Divine Economy to such an extent that the desire for Christ and virtue flourished in his soul. That is why, arriving in Chalcedon, he left the army determined to follow the life according to Christ. From Chalcedon he arrived in Hierapolis and stayed close to a Christian compatriot.

&amp;#x200B;

When his love for Christ began to grow, he began to resort to the temples of the city to pray and learn about the life and martyrdom of the saints, while his desire was to be baptized a Christian. That is why he went to Jerusalem and was baptized a Christian by the later Patriarch Modesto, taking the name Anastasios. He then became a monk in the monastery of Abba Justin, where in parallel with the ministry of the cook and gardener he studied the Bible and the lives of the saints and engaged in prayer and practice. He stayed in the monastery for seven years, but the devil wanted to stop his zeal and ascension to virtue. But with the help of prayer and the spiritual guidance of his elder he managed to remain steadfast in his spiritual struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

An unexpected dream, which revealed to him that he would testify for Christ, motivated him to secretly leave the monastery and go first to Diospolis, then to Mount Garizin and finally to Caesarea in Palestine. There, going to the church of St. Euphemia, he met compatriots of the magician and began to criticize them for their delusion and to call them to abandon the art of magic and follow Christ. In fact, when asked himself, he revealed to them that he was once a magicianand lived in delusion, while now he is now a Christian. Then the Persian soldiers captured him and took him to the lord Marzavanas. Anastasios bravely confessed his Christian faith and then the tyrant tried to persuade him with gifts and promises. But Anastasios remained firm and steadfast in his Christian mind. He was then ordered to tie his legs and neck with an iron chain and was forced to lift huge stones at the fortress of Caesarea.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, many Persian soldiers accused him of abandoning his old faith and becoming a Christian, and these accusations were accompanied by violence against him. Anastasios was led again to the lord Marzavanas, who tried to persuade him to return to his magical art. But Anastasios again confessed his faith in Christ despite the intimidation he received. This was followed by the beating of the martyr, who during his stay in prison prayed incessantly and sang hymns to God surrounded by angels. Marzavanas informed King Hosroes II about Anastasios' obsession with Christ and then he ordered his release if he denied his Christian status for one reason only. But again Anastasios remained committed to his faith, so the tyrant decided to send him to Persia to be tried by the king. Before leaving, he participated in the celebration of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, a fact that strengthened his desire for martyrdom, while also stimulating the religious feeling of Christians. On his way to Persia, the people showed their respect and honor to him, while with him was a brother of the monastery of Abba Justin to support him in his struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

When Anastasios arrived in Persia, the king sent a lord to interrogate him. The glorious martyr bravely confessed his faith in the one and true God and condemned the error in which the Persians are. The bold confession of faith provoked the wrath of the lord, who tried to persuade him. Anastasios was taken to prison and the next day, despite the intimidation and threats, he remained steadfast in his faith. A series of horrible tortures followed to bend Anastasiou's fighting spirit, but he accepted everything with patience and composure. King Chosroes then ordered that he be executed along with the other Christians who were with him in prison. About seventy Christian prisoners were hanged in a river. The same fate befell the glorious martyr Anastasios, whose martyrdom was sealed with his beheading. This event took place on January 22, 627 or 628 AD, a day of celebration of his precious memory. His body was buried with honors in the monastery of Agios Sergios and ten years later the resurrection of his holy relics took place, which is celebrated on January 24. The saint's chariot is kept in Rome in the Abbey of Saints Benedict and Anastasius, and the rest of the holy relic is found in the church of St. Francis of the Vine in Venice.

&amp;#x200B;

In honor of the Saint, two ascetic sequences have been published, one in Kalamata in 1865 and the other in Patras in 1876, while the sports games and his martyrdom are praised through the sequence, which was composed by the Great Hymnographer Gerasimos monk Mikragiannanitis. The honor of the Saint is quite widespread in our country, since churches in his name have been recorded in the Basilica of Evia, Drepano, Achaia, Vryses, Kyparissia, Lakones, Corfu, Tinos, Mykonos and Skopelos. Also memorable is the historic church of Agios destroyed in the earthquakes of 1953 in the city of Zakynthos, while the saint is honored today in the beautiful cathedral of Agios Ioannis Prodromos, founded in 1933 in Loutraki, Corinth, where there is an aisle with T in his name.

&amp;#x200B;

The fervent wish of all of us is the holy glorious holy martyr Anastasios the Persian to unceasingly advocate to the Almighty God for the strengthening of our Christian faith and the spiritual path according to Christ and forerunner in our current egocentric and technocratic age.

&gt;O Lord my God, I know that I am not worthy nor sufficient that thou shouldest enter under my roof into the habitation of my soul, for it is all deserted and in ruins, and thou hast not a fitting place in me to lay thy head. But as from the heights of thy glory thou didst humble thyself, so now bear me in my humility; as thou didst deign to lie in a manger in a cave, so deign now also to come into the manger of my mute soul and corrupt body. As thou didst not refrain from entering into the house of Simon the leper, or shrink from eating there with sinners, so also vouchsafe to enter the house of my poor soul, all leprous and full of sin. Thou didst not reject the sinful woman who ventured to draw near to touch thee, so also have pity on me, a sinner, approaching to touch thee. And grant that I may partake of thine All-holy Body and Precious Blood for the sanctification, enlightenment and strengthening of my weak soul and body; for the relief from the burden of my many sins; for my preservation against all the snares of the devil; for victory over all my sinful and evil habits; for the mortification of my passions; for obedience to thy Commandments; for growth in thy divine Grace and for the inheritance of thy Kingdom. For it is not with careless heart that I approach thee, O Christ my God, but I come trusting in thine infinite goodness, and fearing lest I may be drawn afar from thee and become the prey of the wolf of souls. Wherefore, I pray thee, O Master, who alone art holy, that thou wouldest sanctify my soul and body, my mind and heart and reins, and renew me entirely. Implant in my members the fear of thee, be thou my helper and guide, directing my life in the paths of peace, and make me worthy to stand at thy right hand with thy Saints; through the prayers and intercessions of thine immaculate Mother, of thy Bodiless Servitors, of the immaculate Powers, and of all the Saints who from all ages have been well-pleasing unto thee.

Difficulties accepting circumcision,JVR1640,1611286088,"Hi everyone. 

In the OT, from Abraham on, God asked men to be circumcised in order to establish his covenant. But why did he ask for such an act?????

Well, in the past covenants were made through blood, ok, but why did God ask for that kind of blood?
If God asked me a personal signal for his covenant, I'd be way more comfortable having a knife scar on my face than my genitals mutilated. 

The OT wasn't exactly easy for anyone, and it was in times a bit cruel, and even when there's violence in the OT -I'm studying the whole history of the Mongol Empire, so I'm used to narratives of massacres, mass rapes, beheadings, torture, burnings, back breakings, and bloodbaths- everytime God asks for a circumcision my head aches. 

Why did God make millions of men, incluiding His own Son, to go through that. If He needed a covenant sign, it could have been a tattoo, earrings, a necklace, a bracelet, etc.

Not that I'd ever question God's desicions, but why did He choose such a painful and embarrassing sign for his covenant?

And besides, He didn't ask women for a certain sign.",OrthodoxChristianity

(Apologies for any typos and for being quite lengthy I just had to pour my heart out into this One) 

Like any modern teenage boy I am still riddled with sin. Lustful Temptations constantly get to me including today. And recently I've been struggling a lot more with my paranoia. Paranoia has ran down in my family for generations and ever since I began the path of Christ paranoia hasn't gotten any better. what's worse? It's beginning to affect my prayer life. First began with the simple thought of ""what if he isn't real"". I expected this. After all I come from a more non-Christian background. So thoughts of Doubt came my way. But I've had several Miracles and I Witness Miracles every Sunday involving communion and the Blessed bread. So this one was a bit easier to shake off. But then paranoia about heresy came. Then about apostasy. And then about blasphemy. And soon enough, it was starting to creep into my prayer life. A few days ago a trend that I did not want to happen began. I started praying based off of my paranoia. Now to explain what that means imagine instead of praying from your heart you feel like you have to pray exactly six times and do the Jesus prayer in a exactly specific manner or if you don't meet those requirements you failed a prayer and you have to constantly repeat it. That was one thing. But then it started to shift into if you think even a slightly incorrect thing, if you have a question that doesn't sound right to you, or even if you say a Islamic phrase in your mind then all of a sudden I have to say the Jesus prayer a thousand times while swapping out words and doing it in a very specific voice and pattern or else I'm being condemned to hell. I know this is ridiculous. It really is. And that's what bothers me. And here's the thing, I've been talking to my dad and my priest's wife about it. And while they have given me good advice at the same time I feel like I just need a tad bit more and I need some prayers. Especially because praying and asking for repentance should be a cycle of paranoid torture. As my dad put it I really am torturing myself with prayer which isn't how it's supposed to be. Now thank the Lord I am going to be baptized in a few weeks and God and the Holy martyr of Christ St. George have been getting closer to me and appearing more than my Daily Life however the lustful Temptations and the constant agonizing paranoia is getting to me. All I ask of you is advice and prayers. God bless brothers and sisters üôèüèª‚ò¶Ô∏è",OrthodoxChristianity

Looking for patristic quotes on sickness in church,seventeenninetytwo,1611266338,"I've been considering converting to Orthodoxy for some time now, and I recently contacted a priest from a local parish to begin discussing things.

One thing that came up is that this priest does not believe we can get sick in church, and so his parish has continued to hold services throughout the pandemic. He is quite convinced that this is the patristic view and he tells me that this is the belief and behavior of saints across the centuries, and that it is borderline blasphemous to believe otherwise.

Looking online I can see that this topic has been very divisive in the Orthodox Church and has been discussed ad nauseam and it's a bit disheartening. Each side accuses the other of conforming to the world but in different ways.

I've really come to appreciate the views of the church fathers but I don't think I will have time to thoroughly study them myself before I join a parish, and I don't want to end up joining a parish that is in serious error. I just want to understand what is the viewpoint on this matter of patristic fathers who have experienced theosis.

The Confession of Dositheus and the salvation of infants,bag_mome,1611265400,"Can anyone help me understand decree 16 of the confession which speaks of the necessity of baptism

&gt;We believe Holy Baptism, which was instituted by the Lord, and is conferred in the name of the Holy Trinity, to be of the highest necessity. For without it none is able to be saved, as the Lord says, ‚ÄúWhoever is not born of water and of the Spirit, shall in no way enter into the Kingdom of the Heavens.‚Äù (John 3:5) And, therefore, baptism is necessary even for infants, since they also are subject to original sin, and without Baptism are not able to obtain its remission. Which the Lord showed when he said, not of some only, but simply and absolutely, ‚ÄúWhoever is not born [again],‚Äù which is the same as saying, ‚ÄúAll that after the coming of Christ the Savior would enter into the Kingdom of the Heavens must be regenerated.‚Äù And since infants are men, and as such need salvation, needing salvation they need also Baptism. **And those that are not regenerated, since they have not received the remission of hereditary sin, are, of necessity, subject to eternal punishment, and consequently cannot without Baptism be saved.** So that even infants should, of necessity, be baptized.

Is this really saying that unbaptized infants suffer eternal damnation? This seems like such an incredibly harsh position, even in the West people who held to it were called ""baby-torturers"". Am I misunderstanding or is this a translation issue of some sort? Also, I am aware that this is not binding for you guys.

Considering converting to Orthodoxy. Many fears.,Flecktones37,1611257920,"Hello all, I've been a secularist/atheist most of my life (raised as a liberal Presbyterian) who was introduced to Orthodoxy when my lifelong friend got married in the Church. I majored in Religious Studies in college and was interested enough in the Orthodox Church that I wrote most of my papers on it. If I could believe it, I see that it would give me peace. A few thoughts/fears:

1. My culture is secular. I cannot escape it, or at least find it very difficult to. If Orthodoxy could appeal to both my reason and my heart, I may be brave enough to convert.

2. The idea of laying down my entire life to take up my cross and reorient my priorities, if true, sounds like the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. It also sounds terrifying to leave what I know. I hope you understand what I mean.

3. If I were to embrace Orthodoxy, I would have to accept that I sin a lot. Constantly. I could say to myself that I won't do a really big sin again, and within 24/48 hours I'm doing it again. I imagine this is one reason why it's important to be in community and seek spiritual mothers and fathers.

4. Ideas that are not Christianity are appealing to me. There are so many of them competing for my attention. If I were to embrace Orthodoxy I would need to find peace with evangelizing while leaving questions of who will be saved or not up to God. The alternative constant fear of hell fosters too much anxiety in me.

5. The teachings of Orthodoxy, if true, are beautiful. However, I would have to believe that the vast majority of people who seek God could come to know Godin whichever ways suit their personality and situation because the idea of God  progressively revealing God's true nature to the initiated (I.E, Orthodox Christians) can feel like secret knowledge that one must be initiated to find. I find my mind's objections being similar to the objections I have to Gnosticism. I hope I'm not misunderstood here.

How do we distinguish good thoughts from bad ones?,Plastic-Car456,1611256100,"Giving someone a loaf of bread is a good idea.

Accepting the thought of stealing is a bad thought.

But what do we do with the weird ones?

Let me explain. 

I struggled with thoughts that blame me for things I didn't do.After long torments, I hope I escaped.But now I have different thoughts about possible future things that have to do with the past. 

 For example, when I was in high school, I went to the park with the whole class. Moment when we all started telling jokes and fooling around (nothing indecent or inappropriate).And now I'm thinking, if one of my colleagues filmed, and in the coming years he will post on social media accounts? or if I said something inappropriate and I forgot and it will be posted?

Or, also in high school, I did my homework on skype with my classmates. What if one of them filmed and filmed me when I was crooked or eating something and that video will post it in a few years and I will disappoint my children / in-laws / my half ?

Or,because I gossiped about someone a long time ago and they're going to the police for who knows what?

Or,what if I didn't wash my hands properly,cooked the meal and my favorite ones will got sick? 

My father told me that I have too much free time and I have nothing to do with it. Which is true. But I can think even when I do a lot of work.

A desire to learn more,slickrick0133,1611247143,"Hello all, Protestant here that has had a long fascination with Orthodoxy. So far I've only watched two live streams (one Coptic/Oriental and one Greek/Eastern).  However I have some questions. Not necessarily expecting anyone particular to have all the answers. I mean no disrespect to any of these questions whatsoever and really just want to learn more on specific topics.


Firstly, my biggest hang up is the veneration of icons. I'll leave this here that is from Wikipedia as it sums up the view I have on this issue.

""Icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an inappropriate innovation in the Church, and a return to pagan practice.

""Satan misled men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The Law of Moses and the Prophets cooperated to remove this ruin...But the previously mentioned demiurge of evil...gradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.""

It was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition, of which there was a written record opposing religious images. The Spanish¬†Synod of Elvira¬†(c. 305) had declared that ""Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration"", and some decades later¬†Eusebius of Caesaria¬†may have written a letter to¬†Constantia¬†(Emperor Constantine's sister) saying ""To depict purely the human form of Christ before its transformation, on the other hand, is to break the commandment of God and to fall into pagan error"";¬†Bishop¬†Epiphanius of Salamis¬†wrote his letter 51 to John, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 394) in which he recounted how he tore down an image in a church and admonished the other bishop that such images are ""opposed ‚Ä¶ to our religion"",although the authenticity of this letter has also long been disputed, and remains uncertain. However, as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles with traditions of religious images, and especially after the conversion of Constantine (c. 312), the legalization of Christianity, and, later that century, the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire, many new people came into the new large public churches, which began to be decorated with images that certainly drew in part on imperial and pagan imagery: ""The representations of Christ as the Almighty Lord on his judgment throne owed something to pictures of Zeus. Portraits of the Mother of God were not wholly independent of a pagan past of venerated mother-goddesses. In the popular mind the saints had come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities.""

What makes the Orthodox Church believe in this? Are there specific scripture?

1 Timothy 2:5 - ""For¬†there is¬†one God and¬†one Mediator between God and men,¬†the¬†Man Christ Jesus""

Hebrews 7:23: - ""Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing.¬†24¬†But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.¬†25¬†Therefore He is also¬†able to save¬†[h]to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives¬†to make intercession for them."" 


Secondly, I have often seen arguments against certain aspects of Orthodoxy as essentially""it's how we always have done it/ it's part of our traditions"". However did Jesus not refute that very argument? (Matthew 15)

""And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?¬†4For God said, ‚ÄòHonor your father and mother‚Äô¬†a¬†and ‚ÄòAnyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.‚Äô¬†b¬†5But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is ‚Äòdevoted to God,‚Äô¬†6they are not to ‚Äòhonor their father or mother‚Äô with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.¬†7You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:

8‚Äú ‚ÄòThese people honor me with their lips,
but their hearts are far from me.
9They worship me in vain;
their teachings are merely human rules.‚Äô¬†c¬†‚Äù


Thirdly the Orthodox Church especially Eastern Orthodox seems to be prideful in a sense. I see members essentially looking down at others. Treating those from different denominations as non-Christians or not part of the true Church. Is this not up to God to determine who is worthy to be called among Him and His Church?

""1‚ÄúFor the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.¬†2He agreed to pay them a denarius¬†a¬†for the day and sent them into his vineyard.
3‚ÄúAbout nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.¬†4He told them, ‚ÄòYou also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.‚Äô¬†5So they went.
‚ÄúHe went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing.¬†6About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, ‚ÄòWhy have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?‚Äô
7‚Äú ‚ÄòBecause no one has hired us,‚Äô they answered.
‚ÄúHe said to them, ‚ÄòYou also go and work in my vineyard.‚Äô
8‚ÄúWhen evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‚ÄòCall the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.‚Äô
9‚ÄúThe workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius.¬†10So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.¬†11When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.¬†12‚ÄòThese who were hired last worked only one hour,‚Äô they said, ‚Äòand you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.‚Äô
13‚ÄúBut he answered one of them, ‚ÄòI am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn‚Äôt you agree to work for a denarius?¬†14Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you.¬†15Don‚Äôt I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?‚Äô
16‚ÄúSo the last will be first, and the first will be last.‚Äù

Catholic considering Orthodoxy - difficult questions.,F1SC,1611196163,"Hi all,

I am Catholic and have been considering Orthodoxy for a variety of reasons/concerns outlined below.  - can you please give me any insights -  


\*The Catholic view of Sin vs Orthodox - I have realised that the Catholic Church feels extremely legalistic, be a faithful Catholic your entire life, don't go to Church on Sunday (they say a 'mortal sin') die on Monday and spend eternity in hell, stumble at the wrong time through our weak flesh and your damned. Many Catholics are constantly wondering if they are saved or damned at any point in time. It seems to discount the sacrifice of Christ, our Faith in him and the acknowledgement we WILL fall into sin through our flesh.

\*A personal example - It is not a good time for my wife and I to have children at the moment. We have also had  two failed pregnancies and don't want to risk going through the anguish again at the moment. The Catholic Church teaches that if I practised the 'withdrawl method' today, and then died tonight I'd be heading straight to Hell for eternity. What is the Orthodox view on this?   


\*The relationship with Jesus vs the Church - The Catholic Church in my experience seems to big on the relationship with the Church, the Pope etc, but I don't feel many Catholics have a personal relationship with Jesus. 

\*Near my house there is only a Greek Orthodox church, I am not Greek, would it be weird for me to attend a Greek Orthodox Church? It seems in my city any Orthodox church is connected to and attended by certain nationalities ie. Greek, Serbian, Macedonian etc.  


\*My research shows me that some Catholic doctrines are very late, for example, ""indulgences"", these concepts feel invented to me and not at all biblical.  


\*Papal infallibility - this isn't a huge concern for me and I am actually comfortable with this doctrine, I have noticed there is some discrepancy and ambiguity in the Orthodox churches for the very reason there isn't a central authority?

\*I do believe that either the Catholic Church or the Orthodox Church is the true apostolic Church of Jesus - I'm just not sure which one.

Are there are other reasons I should be considering Orthodoxy?

I do believe that the Orthodox Church is the Church founded by Christ and the disciples. The historical record is evident. However, I do not believe the creed.

Holy water and forgiveness of sins,AltOfReddit,1611179948,"I'm a bit confused about the use of holy water in Orthodoxy.. I know that in Catholicism blessing yourself with holy water is done to ask God's forgiveness for venial sins.

Well, to put you in a context, I'm a 19-year-old guy, my hormones are at an all-time high, and it's almost impossible to try to not see sexual images, because they're everywhere. You may be watching a basketball game, and in a commercial break there's model in underwear, or you may be in the street and in a store appears a poster about lingerie. 
Just a minutes ago, I was looking my aunt's Whatsapp status, she mostly post religious things, and next an attractive former high school classmate has in her status a pic of herself in bikini. 

Plus, the fact that my brothers are literally hooking up in our house with their girlfriends isn't helping either. 

Unfortunately and sadly I'm not made of steel and stone, I'm made of flesh and blood. When every other guy around me is freely having sex, I'm told not to. 
My body is asking me for some action, and there's not a kill-your-libido pill in the drug store.

Why does God make us suffer this way?",OrthodoxChristianity
Questions about Veneration and what to do upon entering and exiting the Church as a new(ish) Orthodox Christian,kingdavid0033,1611172448,"So the title pretty much is the gist of it, but basically I went through catechesis during the p-demic (don‚Äôt want to trigger the bot lol) and due to that, most of my teaching was done online with the priest. That being said, most of the time I feel completely uncomfortable walking into the Church building until I find my seat and then I can just follow along with everyone else. Yes, I know how to properly make the sign of the Cross and I know when the Holy Trinity is invoked that I make the sign of the Cross, but other than that I have NO IDEA what to do when:

1. I walk in the building (ie how to venerate the icon or icons and in what order)

2. Walk in the sanctuary (ie how to venerate the icon or icons and in what order)

3. Do I make the sign of the Cross when the Most Holy Theotokos is mentioned? (Or other Saints?)

4. Also, I know different parishes and parishioners (Greek, Antiochian, Russian, etc) make the sign of the Cross differently. Is there a certain way I should and why? I know some people make the sign of the Cross 3 times, touch the floor, etc. 

4. When I walk out of the building (ie how to venerate the icon or icons and in what order)

5. Walk out of the sanctuary (ie how to venerate the icon or icons and in what order)

I know this may all sound crazy that I haven‚Äôt been taught this, but I feel like my catechesis was rushed. I‚Äôm not going to bash the priest or anything like that because I can‚Äôt imagine having to do this during all that‚Äôs gone on in the world the last year. Also, I am most definitely not going to ask him about this stuff because I don‚Äôt want to make him feel bad or embarrass him. 

I just want to make sure I am showing the utmost respect and veneration to our Lord and the Theotokos and the Saints. Thank you all for your help!! ‚ò¶Ô∏è

Questions about confession,JVR1640,1611170007,"Hi.
Well, before baptism in adults, in the EOC is the rule to have a confessiom, as well as in other times.
My question is, why do we as sinners have to confess our sins to another sinner?

Can someone chant in a non byzantine style and still praise the Lord,Nead0n1,1611164505,"This topic has to a bit with theology as well.

But then I though shouldn't we keep the tradition as the Apostle Paul tells us?

Orthodoxy and Evolution,DeadCircuits,1611143100,"I know this is a controversial topic, my aim is not to provoke a debate here.

I had spent quite some time as an atheist, during which I absorbed the arguments in favour of evolution and became quite convinced.

Since converting I have been introduced to the idea that evolution is incompatible with the Christian faith. The notion being that evolution means that death was in existence for billions of years before man even came on the scene and that it thus damages the whole theology of Christianity.

I am aware that there must be Orthodox Christians who don't see this as a problem, but I am unaware of how they resolve it. I would kindly ask if anyone can point me to articles, books, or videos that specifically address this issue.

I'm currently deciding to put the issue in a box and leave it unresolved, but I feel like I put myself on weak ground if I decide that it's either Christianity or evolution, because I am aware that there is a preponderance of evidence for the latter.

Looking to learn more about Orthodoxy,Iraelia18,1611123003,"Good evening,

As you can probably garner from my past posts, I'm a former Christian (raised Lutheran) who has been studying and practicing Sikhi during quarantine. I really love the faith and connect to the teachings of the Gurus, but I've been running into issues lately. Namely, the ethnic barrier between me and most adherents of Sikhi. As much as Sikhi is meant to be a religion for everyone, in practice it is a rallying point for Punjabi-American Culture. Which is awesome, I'm glad they've been able to maintain their traditions in the United States, but I feel as though I'm cut off from and isolated from the wider Sikh community. When I'm at Gurdwara, I'm always the only white person there. When I'm eating langar, I'm always sitting by my own. During meetings with other Sikhs, I always get the vague sense that they view me as an other. Which is understandable, not many white people have become Sikhs and most who do have joined a [cult.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3HO) Beyond that, it's just very clear to me that Sikhi is very much wrapped up in a cultural tradition which I will never actually belong to.

In light of this, I've been getting back in touch with Christianity. My Grandmother, who is deeply Catholic, gave me rosary with sand from Jerusalem and I've been praying over it on occasion. In addition, and I know this is gonna sound really silly, but I recently re-watched Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ. I know the film, and the book it's based on, are incredibly controversial, but whenever I am contemplating God, even as a Sikh, I find myself thinking back to the final scene of that movie, where Christ, having asked God the Father for forgiveness, is brought back to the cross and gleefully shouts ""It is accomplished!"" before the film reel burns out. I never understood the victory of the cross until I'd seen that scene, I'd always thought it to be a deeply mournful moment. But in watching that film I came to appreciate the martyrdom of Christ, His sacrifice, and what it means, at least to a Christian, for man's relationship with God.

I'd always been drawn to Orthodox Christianity in particular, I find it to most accurately resemble the church immediately after the death of Christ, and I always admired the ceremony of Orthodox worship. Because of this, I was wondering if anyone here could point me to some resources to learn more about Orthodoxy, and if anyone would like to have a one on one discussion about it I would greatly appreciate that.

Anti-mask fear is the latest iteration of the bar code scare from 20 years ago,ilovedatstan,1611012881,"If you're not familiar with the scare around bar codes, it was especially prominent in Russia in the early 2000s. Basically people believed that bar codes, credit cards, tax ID numbers, all contained the mark of the beast that could ""seal"" itself somehow in the person associated with it. We see a similar thread of logic with masks or vaccines, where the physical wearing of the mask is associated with the anti-Christ, mark of the beast, etc.

**Ultimately, both express a faith in the material world - that a material object itself can damn a person**. Ironically, this materialism has more in common with Voodoo or the occult than anything Christian.

From¬†[OrthoChristian.com](https://OrthoChristian.com):

&gt;*The Elder asked me: ‚ÄúTell me, my child, what did Elder Aemilianos say about 666 and the Antichrist?‚Äù*

What was the error of Dioscorus of Alexandria and Severus of Antioch?,Public-Heretic,1611005202,"The 6th Ecumenical Council condemns them as heretics:

&gt;Wherefore this our¬†holy¬†and Ecumenical Synod having driven away the impious¬†error¬†which had prevailed for a certain time until now, and following closely the straight path of the¬†holy¬†and approved Fathers, has piously given its full assent to the five¬†holy¬†and Ecumenical Synods (that is to say, to that of the 318¬†holy¬†Fathers who assembled in Nice against the raging¬†Arius; and the next in Constantinople of the 150 God-inspired men against Macedonius the adversary of the¬†Spirit, and the impious¬†Apollinaris; and also the first in¬†Ephesus¬†of 200 venerable men convened against¬†Nestorius¬†the¬†Judaizer; **and that in Chalcedon of 630 God-inspired Fathers against Eutyches and Dioscorus¬†hated¬†of¬†God**; and in addition to these, to the last, that is the Fifth¬†holy¬†Synod assembled in this place, against¬†Theodore of Mopsuestia,¬†Origen, Didymus, and Evagrius, and the writings of¬†Theodoret¬†against the Twelve Chapters of the celebrated Cyril, and the Epistle which was said to be written by¬†Ibas¬†to Maris the Persian), renewing in all things the ancient decrees of religion, and chasing away the impious doctrines of irreligion.

&gt;. . .

&gt;Moreover we confirm that¬†faith¬†which at Chalcedon, the Metropolis, was set forth in accordance with¬†orthodoxy¬†by the six hundred and thirty God-approved fathers in the time of Marcian, who was our Emperor, which handed down with a great and mighty voice, even unto the ends of the earth, that the one Christ, the¬†son of God, is of two¬†natures, and must be¬†glorified¬†in these two¬†natures, and which cast forth from the sacred precincts of the¬†Church¬†as a black pestilence to be avoided, Eutyches, babbling stupidly and inanely, and teaching that the great¬†mystery¬†of the¬†incarnation¬†(Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒøŒΩœâŒº·Ω∑Œ±œÇ) was perfected in thought only. **And together with him also¬†Nestorius¬†and Dioscorus of whom the former was the defender and champion of the division, the latter of the confusion [of the two¬†natures¬†in the one Christ]**, both of whom fell away from the divergence of their impiety to a common depth of perdition and denial of¬†God.

&gt;. . .

&gt;But as the author of¬†evil, who, in the beginning, availed himself of the aid of the serpent, and by it brought the poison of death upon the¬†human race, has not desisted, but in like manner now, having found suitable instruments for working out his will (we mean Theodorus, who was Bishop of Pharan, Sergius, Pyrrhus,¬†Paul¬†and Peter, who were Archbishops of this royal city, and moreover, Honorius who was Pope of the elder Rome, Cyrus Bishop of Alexandria, Macarius who was lately¬†bishop¬†of¬†Antioch, and Stephen his¬†disciple), has actively employed them in raising up for the whole¬†Church¬†the stumbling-blocks of one will and one operation in the two¬†natures¬†of Christ our¬†true¬†God, one of the¬†Holy Trinity; thus disseminating, in novel terms, among the¬†orthodox¬†people, **an¬†heresy¬†similar to the mad and¬†wicked doctrine¬†of the impious¬†Apollinaris, Severus, and Themistius**, and endeavouring craftily to destroy the perfection of the¬†incarnation¬†of the same¬†our Lord Jesus Christ, our¬†God, by¬†blasphemously¬†representing his flesh endowed with a rational¬†soul¬†as devoid of will or operation.

Apparently Dioscorus was understood to be an Eutychian and Severus was understood to be a Monothelite. Is this true? Would they really disagree with the ""one nature"" formula of the 5th Ecumenical Council?

&gt;If anyone uses the expression¬†of two¬†natures,¬†confessing that a union was made of the Godhead and of the humanity, or the expression¬†the one nature made flesh of¬†God the Word,¬†and shall not so understand those expressions as the¬†holy¬†Fathers have taught, to wit: that of the divine and¬†human¬†nature¬†there was made an hypostatic union, whereof is one Christ; but from these expressions shall try to introduce one nature or substance [made by a mixture] of the Godhead and manhood of Christ; let him be¬†anathema. For in teaching that the only-begotten Word was united hypostatically [to humanity] we do not mean to say that there was made a mutual confusion of natures, but rather each [nature] remaining what it was, we understand that the Word was united to the flesh.

Can i feel sorry about the unfaithful ones or just look only for my son(Please Read All The Article),Nead0n1,1611004876,So I recently had a discussion with someone and they think that we should only care for our souls and leave people in the darkness.

Question from a non-Orthodox,authwithqs,1611001785,"Hello there! 

I am an author that is not Eastern Orthodox, and I am trying to create a realistic Greek Orthodox woman in my book, and all the churches near me are shut due to Covid, so I thought I would bring my question here as I cannot ask a priest directly :). I have been searching for some sense of an answer on the internet but it is hard to find. 

My question is, in the Greek/general Orthodox church, is the head-covering for women seen as something that is needed, and if so, is it a thing that is only worn in the church, or something that is worn everyday like a hijab for a Muslim woman? I am aware that some Orthodox churches, especially Russian, women generally wear them but I wasn't too sure if it was different with Greek? Or is it more down to personal interpretation of scripture on where and how often they are worn? (and if so, do many women opt to wear them a lot?) I am aware there is no one right answer in such beliefs but I would be thankful for some sense of what's average so I know I'm on the right tracks :)

Also, if there is anything else you may think I might need to know in the general life of a Greek Orthodox woman, I would find that incredibly helpful and it would be massively appreciated on my behalf :) I have been reading around a lot but I definitely think it is better to hear it directly from someone who is more engaged with the religion.

Is lying always a sin?,Public-Heretic,1611001550,"On one hand, the Law forbids *false testimonies* or lies intended to hurt others, and Christ takes it further and forbids *promises* altogether, but that our ""yes"" be ""yes"" and our ""no"" be ""no"". In the Desert Fathers we also find a saying that if you do not lie, you heap up sins for yourself, with the example of lying to protect a fleeing criminal instead of delivering him over to the executioner. 

But every Orthodox source I can find online says that lying is **categorically** a sin, and that if we want to not tell the truth we must only stay quiet. 

So, which one is it? Is lying always a sin in all circumstances? Or is lying not necessarily a sin if it is without a malicious intent?",OrthodoxChristianity
Should I tell my friends in another city about Orthodoxy if there is no church?,Chatechized,1610997818,"So I have recently decided to become a catechumen and some very dear friends of mine who live in another city I used to live in are going through some frustrations and deconstructing of their own faith in a fairly charismatic non-denominational church that we all used to be a part of. I've talked to them about why I left ages ago and they were polite but it didn't matter. I made the transition from non-denominational to Presbyterian and explained it all to them, and now I'm doing the same for Orthodoxy so they may be skeptical as it is.




Nevertheless, I'd like to share more with them but there isn't an Orthodox Church for more than 80 miles in every direction that still runs. There is one that exists in their city and it's very beautiful but there is only one parishioner, no priest, and they obviously cannot celebrate the Divine Liturgy, so I even wonder what good it may do to discuss it with them to begin with if they can't even go to a church at all and there is no community and no priest.

What are the Church's views on divorce of this nature?,PrayerRequester,1610945873,"I'm new here, and interested in converting to Orthodox Christianity from Baptist Christianity. I have a question about the Church's views on divorce, but am accepting of any advice or ideas anyone has that could help my marriage.

Here's my story. I married my husband who I thought was a Christian about a year ago. Not long after the marriage, he pressured me to have anal sex. I didn't feel good about it, and am worried about the health risks and what it would do to my body. I also sense a spiritual darkness about it.

My husband very specifically has said that soon, either I do this act or he abandons the marriage. Both he and I realize that this marriage isn't perfect in other ways, but the point that he has made very clear and over and over again is that the decision of the future of our marriage will be made by him over this issue. He talks about nothing but this issue, day and night, and has in no uncertain terms made himself clear on this being the reason for his abandoning a marriage, saying he ""needs it"" in a marriage or relationship. 

Other than this act, we come together sexually on a regular basis. I am willing to do other things, but he doesn't care about this. He cares about only anal.

Me and a friend have been praying and fasting about this frequently. I have told others to pray for me, but don't say what for. I am trying to do what I can to get this marriage to work. This was the first man I have ever been intimate with, and I waited 30 years to marry him. I waited for marriage to be intimate with him, and thought this marriage was an answer to prayer and waiting on the Lord.

I want this marriage to work out, but if it doesn't, and he decides to leave, is it considered wrong on my part to remarry? Marriage is something my heart greatly desires. Thank you.",OrthodoxChristianity

From what I can gather from Wikipedia, the authoritative work on this topic is ""Book of Union"" by Babai the Great (551-628). He wrote, amongst other things, that:

""One is Christ the Son of God,

Worshiped by all in two natures;

In His Godhead begotten of the Father,

Without beginning before all time;

In His humanity born of Mary,

In the fullness of time, in a body united;

Neither His Godhead is of the nature of the mother,

Nor His humanity of the nature of the Father;

The natures are preserved in their Qnumas (substance),

In one person of one Sonship.

And as the Godhead is three substances in one nature,

Likewise the Sonship of the Son is in two natures, one person.

So the Holy Church has taught."" 

Wikipedia also states: ""The Church of the East could accept expressions like 'Christ died', 'the Son died', but not 'the Word died', even not 'the Word died in the flesh'.""

For example the first liturgies were served in houses and were full meals, also it seems like it was much more spontaneous. He further said that the early church was closer to Protestant services ( albeit with the cultural trappings of antiquity ). If the goal of us orthodox is to preserve original praxis how have we let innovations like the iconostasis or the altar sneak in. Also what is stopping us now from adding new things into the liturgy, if anything our liturgical conservatism is against the spirit of the early church.

Saint Paisios : What is the prayer against the devil,leon1271,1610911442,"\- Elder, I feel powerless to face any temptation and difficulty.

\- You do not say the wish? As the ships in danger emit S.O.S., so do you constantly say: ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me"", and you will receive help.

 For me, once, temptation would throw me off the cliff if I did not say the wish; the wish saved me. When I was at the Holy Monastery of Stomi, one night I went to a cave that was located in a dangerous and steep place. She was very small; I had put some stones out of its opening, because it was a cliff below. I said the wish all night. At dawn, in the silence, a frightening ""peacock"" and a loud flutter of wings sounded right next to me. I was surprised. ""Lord Jesus Christ,"" I shouted and was thrown out. I almost fell off the cliff. But I immediately realized that it was the temptation and I continued the wish, while my ears were buzzing with the noise.

Elder, when one says the wish only with the mouth, without involving the mind, does that help?  
\- That helps too. Of course, he does not chase away the enemy, but, with the gusts he throws at him, he fixes him where he is.

Wish has great power; it is a terrible weapon against the devil. It is like shooting the devil with spiritual bullets and he can not approach. Once a probationary monk, who lived in the Hermitage of St. Anne, said the wish, and the devil mocked him and kept saying ""mmm."". Then he heard the devil shout: ""In the Skete of the Old Woman the monks do not let me approach"".

Elder, when I have evil or blasphemous thoughts and I try to say the wish, can I draw the wrath of God?

\- No. The tagalaki from his wickedness sows evil thoughts, but you use it as a worker in unceasing prayer. To say to him: ""good that you brought me these thoughts, because I had forgotten God"", and to say the wish. The tagalaki, when he sees that he is doing you good, will retreat on his own, because it is not in his interest to use this as an occasion for you to pray. When it subsides and you no longer mind, you will have acquired unceasing prayer.

However, the devil, without wanting to, does great good in the end; that is why God forgives him. When I was in the Skete of Iveron, one night the tagals went to kill me with a slate! In the afternoon, a distressed man had passed through Kalivi. I gave him all the money I had and he left. At night I hear knocks on the door. I thought he would think I had more money and came back. ""Who is it?"" I shout. Nothing. I then hear knocks on the other door. I light a candle to light it. ""Who is it?"" I shout again. Nothing. In a little while I hear knocks on the ceiling. ""Well, now we have agreed!"", I say. And a noise begins!

I knelt down and kept saying the wish. Suddenly, they throw a slab from above ""bam!"". He broke the plank from the ceiling and half the plate came out just above my head with my nose down. ""I understand, I said, so we will go all night!"" We were vigilant afterwards. Me with the wish and the tags with the blows on the roof ŒÆœÑŒ±ŒΩ These were beautiful vigils!

Wish means war against tagalaki. Therefore, the tagalaki will also fight in defense. The tagalikas are disarmed, only when one fights them with a leventia that has humility inside, and not with a selfish lad.

"What do you know about logismoi,how do you know they are logismoi and how to overcome them?",Plastic-Car456,1610903676,"Hi. (Long post) 

For some time I have been assailed by thoughts that do not give me peace and I am afraid that if I do not do research on them, maybe I have done something wrong in the past.

All my life I've been careful what I talk about and how I behave with the opposite gender.

A few months ago I wanted to do a digital cleaning through conversations, emails, pictures, social networks.

After this,a wave of harassing thoughts, I might say, came over me: ""What if you talked indecently to strangers? What if you sent or posted indecent things?""

&amp;#x200B;

As long as I had those conversations, emails, social media accounts, I never had those thoughts, nor did I care. They only appeared after I deleted them.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone told me that if I had done such things I would have remembered that it was not like locking the door at bedtime, and once you forgot.

the problem is that I love a religious person and we can't be together if I were a person who would do such things.

I don't even know what to say to confession to get advice. Should I say ""I did those things"" or say ""I don't know if I did them""?

Every time I think of that person dearly, those thoughts are even more violent.

  I actually came to believe that I am exactly what my thoughts tell me: an indecent person. These thoughts brought me to my knees. I can't stand this guilt anymore.And the most stupid thing seems to me is that I don't even know if it's true. If I still feel guilty, I want to know why and for what. I feel like my life is over, but I'm not even sure.

&amp;#x200B;

And I don't just have thoughts like that, I have thoughts about diseases, and the fact that maybe I hit someone and all sorts of things.  Although my rationally and logically thinking tells me that these things are not true, the people around me tell me the same, my mind does not want to believe and blames me.

I would not give importance to these thoughts, but I am afraid that not giving them importance I will miss something, and others, and me, will suffer.

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise, memories and images come to my mind that I don't want. Things I left in the past and thought they rotted there.

How do I learn to be Orthodox?,Principal-Moo,1610881549,"Hi everyone,

A brief history about myself: I grew up in a non-denominational Christian home. In 2009, when I was in my early 30's, I joined the Roman Catholic Church. I quickly realized that RC was not teaching what it was supposed to and I found the EO church (ironically, I found the EO church because a Catholic bookstore was selling The Way of a Pilgrim). 

In 2016, I joined the EO church. I did not join like most poeple. I am a US citizen, but I live in Hanoi, Vietnam. I was trying to find an Orthodox church in the area and could not find anything until I discovered that a Russian Orthodox priest was going to begin visiting Hanoi every few months. I contacted Father, met him when he first visited Hanoi and he brought me into the church (he asked me some questions and then chrismated me). 

Here are my problems: I did not have a formal catechism. I was very knowledgeable about Catholicism and I believe Father felt I knew enough to become Orthodox. The community here is all Russian: I am the only non-Russian speaking member. When we have Divine Liturgy, I try to follow along in English, but I am not fully immersed (I spend a lot of time ensuring I'm in the right place). When I make my confession, I know Father does not understand English so we cannot really talk about my Confession (now that I have finished my doctorate, I have vowed to learn Russian to break this barrier). But, I do not know a lot of other things about Orthodoxy, like when to make the sign of the cross (I have caught on that you do it when you pray Gospodi Pomilui and Tibia, Gospodi), what is the proper way to venerate an icon (I noticed lots of people do their own thing), which rite (is that even right?) to use on Sundays (it's usually the Liturgy of John Chrysostom, but it changes, right?). 

I just don't know how to be a proper Orthodox. I have tried looking things up online and each website is different. Any idea where I can start? Speaking with the priest will be difficult, not only because of language barriers, but because of location (Father lives in one area, but travels throughout Vietnam to offer the Liturgy).

Christ the Eternal Tao vs Orthodoxy &amp; The Religion of The Future,Ragnarross,1610880662,"So I've recently read both these books, I am mainly interested in the intersection and differences between Orthodoxy and the Eastern faiths. I'm a bit confused in that it seems that they paint quite a different picture... Fr. Damascene, the writer of Christ and the Eternal Tao, was a student to Fr. Seraphim Rose, the writer of Orthodoxy &amp; The Religion of the Future. And yet it seems to me that the former (Fr. Damascene) takes a much more positive attitude towards the Eastern Faiths... he sees Taoism (&amp; perhaps other Eastern faiths), as a preparation for Christianity, and even considers the experiences and insights one can gain out of Eastern practices as being ""external"" experiences of grace acting on one from the outside. Fr. Rose, on the other hand, considers most of these experiences to be demonic in origin, and deceptive.

1) I'm not sure I comprehend what Fr. Damascene means through the distinction he makes between grace acting internally, from the inside out, for the Christian after the coming of Christ, vs grace acting from the outside in for Lao Tzu and the sages who came before Christ... I really can't understand this difference... and how come it was NOT possible for the virtuous sages before to experience Christ in their mystical experiences. So if someone could help me out on this I'd appreciate it.

and then

2) What are we to make of the idea that the experience of the Zen master is the same experience as the Christian, but with a different interpretation? Fr. Damascene says:

""*To this day,* *I consider it \[Zen mystical experience\] a real experience, an insight into eternity. The problem was not in the insight, but in my interpretation of it \[...\] Fr. Sophrony, having been \[in his young age\] a yogi himself, did not deny the truth of the experiences of trans-personal consciousness. He was not an externally-minded Christian, enslaved in the letter of the law, who would just dismiss the experience of non-Christian spiritual practitioners as being evil and demonic.""

"Defense of Orthodox Christianity I made in r/exmuslim when some guy started saying that Christianity is worse than Islam, and went through all the cliches and stuff. Hope I was accurate, I‚Äôm not actually orthodox but interested",AncapElijah,1610870174,"Here‚Äôs what I said to him/her

‚ÄúYour issues with Christianity are primarily with Protestantism, Puritanism, etc, not as much with the catholic and Orthodox Church.

Protestants take every word of the Bible as literal fact, when in reality whole sections such as the first half of genesis are supposed to be symbolic pretellings and such. They think rhat god points to random things and calls them bad or good, when in reality the issue is more complex. Object sins or indulgence (sins regarding sex, drugs, overeating, that type of thing (making something your god)) aren‚Äôt sins because god randomly says they are, they are self-punishing sins that cause you to suffer if you choose to over indulge, for example. These simply come about by human nature and the actions we partake in. Protestants also expect god to work miracles nonstop and for everything in your life to be good, but this sets people up for a fall, since the part of god that you come in contact with in the normal world is the Holy Spirit, the non-all powerful panentheistic spirit directed by the father. The Holy Spirit works through the spirit of god everywhere and in all things, to achieve gods will. The Holy Spirit can‚Äôt magically do what you want if you have belief. 

Protestants treat hell like it‚Äôs some punishment straight from god‚Äôs hand, when in reality it‚Äôs simply the state of your soul. If your mind/body, and the soul inhabiting it are corrupted, that‚Äôs how you end up after death. People not understanding this leads to people using hell as some binary punishment from good for doing random things seen as bad.

When it comes to the ‚Äúforced conversion‚Äù, that‚Äôs not a part of real Christian beliefs. Individuals have free will and forcing someone to pretend they are Christian doesn‚Äôt make them any better off. Government‚Äôs used Christianity as a mask to take over foreign lands, and would the. Impress the beliefs on the people. It‚Äôs the government‚Äôs fault, not the religion. Islam, in contrast, calls for forced conversion directly AND in its culture.

Is God omnipotent?,kountouris08,1610862757,"I was thinking about the idea of an unmovable object meets an unstoppable force, I came to the conclusion that since God is all-mighty, He would by definition be both the most unmovable object and most unstoppable force in existence, and since God's will can't be divided, He can't oppose himself and therefor this fallacy doesn't apply.

But this also got me thinking about the attributes of God. From a philosophy standpoint, I have never read any Orthodox writings on God's attributes, I've only seen Thomas Aquinas', many of which I know are considered to be false in our church (for example the simplicity of God).

Catholics and Protestants seem to hold firmly to the belief that God is omnipotent, but I wanted to hear the Orthodox point of view on this topic, so I have a few questions:  
1. Is God omnipotent?   
2. If God is omnipotent, can God create another omnipotent ""god"" with separate will?  
3.  Are there any Orthodox theologians who have compiled lists of God's attributes similar to Aquinas' list?   
4. Can God change what sin is, or is God essentially inseparable from the meaning of righteousness which means anything he does is by definition good?

This, despite the fact that I devote a lot of time, energy, and effort to making careful decisions and avoiding any form of trouble. I take risks whenever I consider it my duty to take them, and only then. 

I don't want to dox myself, so I won't give too many details. Suffice it to say that bizarre things go wrong that nobody could possibly have anticipated, or even imagined. Other things go wrong that are completely run of the mill, but a large number of them go wrong at once, leaving me feeling overwhelmed. 

I am currently battling panic attacks and general anxiety disorder. Problem is, whenever I get a panic attack, something serious usually does go wrong in my environment fairly soon. The other problem is that this feeling of fear gives me zero information about what catastrophe is approaching, or what, if anything, I could do to mitigate it. This anxiety is harming my health. 

I have recurring nightmares about problems in the workplace and elsewhere that I cannot resolve.

Have to share!!! I am not a covert yet. I have been on an Orthodox journey for a year now self-study because the closest church is 1:45 minutes away but I have been in contact via email with a priest. Thursday night It was heavy on my heart that I have not at least visited a priest in person to the point I became emotional. I prayed that God would open doors and time away from my job to go visit a church. Here is where it gets exciting!!!

Last Minute last night I had to run to the grocery store for my wife( I never go, I hate it really.) I was walking into the grocery store and out of nowhere an Orthodox priest walks out and says hello, just to make sure he wasn't a guy in a black nightgown with an Orthodox cross I ask ""are you an Orthodox priest?!?"" ( this is very unlikely in my area) he says ""yes follow me"" I literally follow him to his car haha.

Orthodox &amp; Lutheran Interfaith Marriage,tethron,1610810004,"My girlfriend and I (me being raised Orthodox with a priest for a father, and her being raised ELCA Lutheran with a pastor for a mother) have been discussing how we would go about getting married someday. We aren‚Äôt seriously considering this anytime soon, however the conversation made me curious.

As far as I know, interfaith marriage is fine as long as it‚Äôs with another person who believes in the holy trinity and they are baptized in a church which follows that simple doctrine (with an exception in Mormonism).  We weren‚Äôt worried about that. However, when an interfaith couple gets married, is it true that you must commit to raising the children exclusively orthodox?

I would love to pass on my faith to my children, but I also want them to understand their faith and heritage if my spouse is Lutheran. My girlfriend has said several times that in a perfect world, we would be able to take them to both churches and simply raise them in an interfaith household. However, she‚Äôs also done research, and recognizes the fine line we‚Äôd be walking if that were to happen. 

As I mentioned, her mother is a Lutheran pastor, and her family tree is filled with matriarchs as pastors. I fully understand and respect her desire to pass something on to her children; this is absolutely not a point of tension between us. However, we also do not want to make a wrong move in raising kids and end up no longer being in good standing with the OCA. Any advice?",OrthodoxChristianity

So what is the church view on disability?,RainAndTea77,1610649993,"I want to start this off by stating I‚Äôm not attacking the Church. I‚Äôm in the last few months of my catacuman experience. I am blind so I experience some of this first hand. My priest and fellow parish members have been amazing at trying to make everything as accessible as possible for me. My priest took me through the church and described everything and also has recorded himself reading the catacuman book that was not accessible. All this to say I am a proud catacuman and future orthodox Christian, it just hursts me to see so many individuals with disability that the church could reach out to. The church could reach out to this marginalized group where the each are on an individual basis and show them the love of Christ and power of the community of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic church.   

Some cons I can point out are most churches not accessible especially in America where the building are newer so the excuse of older historical building isn‚Äôt valid. There are very few tactical icons for the blind. The liturgy isn‚Äôt accessible to the deaf or blind.  There are very few websites that are remotely useable for the blind.   There mostly likely numerous others but this is all I came up with off the top of my head. 

Some pros I can point out generally people are very accommodating. The theology it‚Äôs self seems to guide people towards not constantly pitying or demeaning the faith of the disabled.

Are there any Coptic or at least Orthodox responses to Saba Mahmood's Religious Difference In a Secular Age: A Minority Report?,soulsilver_goldheart,1610649379,"I am trying to gather material for an academic thesis surrounding ""Eastern"" Christianity in Western academic settings. I have read excerpts of Saba Mahmood's book (quoted in the title) which makes a direct connection between secularism laws in Egypt and the persecution of Copts.

A few things make me uncomfortable with Mahmood's books, the first of which being that she refers to the Copts as ""Eastern Orthodox"" and at various points lumps them together in an ""Eastern Orthodox"" category, along with Armenians, Ethiopians, Greeks, Russians, and Maronites (who aren't even Orthodox at all, but Catholics). I've also come across one critical review: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/cpt.2015.70](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/cpt.2015.70). This at least alleges that Mahmood implies that the Copts are in part responsible for their own persecution after being granted certain privileges as religious minorities:

""If the Coptic Church endorses secular, corrupt autocrats and secularism leads to more violence against the Copts, then the implicit conclusion is that the Copts are at least partly culpable for their persecution. ‚ÄòThe Coptic Church‚Äôs collusion with the security states bodes ill for the future ‚Ä¶‚Äô (pp. 86‚Äì87).""

I can't pass judgment on whether or not the reviewer's argument is sound. I have seen at least some discussion of Mahmood's take on religious freedom on this sub. Because I have not yet been able to purchase the full text, I was wondering if any scholars of Eastern Christian backgrounds (particularly Coptic scholars) have read or responded to Mahmood's book?

Idk if this maybe is a bit off topic, but a family from  the  parish I go to is letting me go with them in their car to visit a church where the metropolitan is and I asked them if they wanted me to help pay money for gas since I am taking part in the trip and they said no. I still want to give them a gift of some sort to show my appreciation, because it feels wrong for me to not give anything in return. I feel cheap/selfish, you know?
I was wondering if you have any advice on what to give. I dont know then very well, I have only met them a hand full of time (I'm not orthodox yet, im converting thats why I'm going with them), so I am having trouble on figuring out something that is appropriate. Does anyone here have an idea?

Should divorce be avoided at any cost?,grayish_friend,1610642469,"I try to make this short, and sorry if I don't manage to clear enough to be understood.

Me and my husband got married about 10 years ago. It felt right. I truly believed this was the man God had led to my life. And I still believe he was meant to be in my life as I have grown as human thanks to him.

But we have grown apart. We are practically roommates. I feel that have given every single bit of me that I can for our marriage. Willingly and volunteerily. But now I'm empty. I care for my husband, he is part of my family. But we haven't been a couple for a long time. 

All the important things we do separately. Like praying. I'm an orthodox, he is a seventh day adventist. That has never been a problem, but I wish we could do this together. Same thing when it comes  to hobbies, food, travelling etc. We have same values and mutual respect, but our marriage is not what I think a marriage should be.

We have started to discuss about divorce. We think we could easily go towards friends and co-parents -kind of relationship. But both of us want to be sure it's the right course of action. We don't have any outside pressure (no affairs or other issues) so we can take time to seriously consider things. Neither of us want to hold other back or be married to a roommate.

I take marriage seriously, so I keep praying for clarity. I wish to travel this life with Gods guidance. But I feel lost. Could it be that some people are supposed to travel with you only part of the way?",OrthodoxChristianity
"Do I understand ""theosis"" or salvation correctly?",AstronomerOk4608,1610642175,"First, I would like to say that I am a non-denominational Christian and I only became serious in my faith about a month ago. I believe in the Holy Trinity and that Jesus Christ is my Lord and Saviour. I believe that protestants, roman catholics, and orthodox are all Christians. After that, things start to get a little fuzzy... I know that both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church both claim to be One ""The Church"", and so far from my research, it sounds like the EOC sounds the most probable, but again, I am not completely sure. I know that it is a sin to depend too much on human intellect, but I come from a baptist background where admittedly, it was much simpler (just have faith in Jesus!)...But I want as much Jesus as I can get!

So this is how I understand salvation/theosis so far...

It is like a marriage. A marriage takes two to function. We are either in this walk with Jesus, or we are not. The walk with Jesus consists of participating in the sacraments to become holier, especially confession so that all our sins can be cured. The end goal is to become like God, and this is like a synergy, we must submit to the will of God, but it is His grace the transforms us. We have faith that Jesus will heal our hearts, as imperfect as they are.

I read that heaven and hell is one place in the afterlife, and depending on the state of our hearts, experiencing God can be wonderful and perfect (heaven), or horrible (hell).

Now my question is, what if someone were to become a Christian right at the end of their life? They didn't have the time to do theosis... but they had faith that Jesus Christ can save them. And what about protestants who don't practice sacraments? Do they have hearts full of sin, and therefore cannot be in communion with God?

And since nobody can ever become perfect, does this mean that everyone will experience a little bit of hell in the afterlife? Is it some kind of purgatory (I know that purgatory does not exist in the Orthodox faith, but I'm trying to wrap my head around this).

This is what I meant by faith with protestants is so much more simple. We are required to have childlike faith in God, and true faith should produce works/fruits of the Holy Spirit. Right now, I know that I am a sinner, but God is my merciful Father. I am trying to be in communion with Him everyday and stay faithful, He has truly rescued me (I was suicidal), so I don't think the Loving Father would send me to hell just because I don't \*currently\* participate in the sacraments.",OrthodoxChristianity
What do you do when prayer gets co-opted by sloth?,DenMeXereis,1610640364,"BACKGROUND: I'm an Evangelical who doesn't trust Evangelicalism. If I were to look around on the Internet or ask my pastor about this (and I'd rather drink bleach than ask my pastor for help), I would expect to see blame directed at liturgical spirituality (the only spiritual approach that has ever resonated with me) as the problem, and then probably trying to replace it with something with lots more risk of deception. I know the answers here will come with the disclaimer of ""this question is really best directed at a priest,"" but please know that this isn't an option either.

THE PROBLEM: I've tried to keep some form of liturgical prayer rule off and on for probably a decade now. They've never lasted, and although I have on occasion received insight, or consolation, or conviction from them, they've always turned into just another excuse to shirk my responsibilities before I inevitably blow up and abandon them.

Most recently I've tried following Father Hopko's advice of making a rule that's shorter and simpler than I would ""like,"" while still being liturgically based. This went from saying a few prayers twice a day when I was alone to trying to muddle through it while drifting in and out of consciousness before I fall asleep, if I remember to. All while *constantly* ignoring work and family duties in order to compile Scripture readings, weigh the merits of sanctoral calendars, try to make a web app that simplifies all these things so I might actually get around to doing them... And all this on top of a million other dissipations: cooking things nobody but me wants to eat; writing music nobody but me wants to hear, play, or buy; putting together D&amp;D adventures I'll never play; languages I'll never use; books about things I can learn by just pulling my head out of the sunless orifice I always have it in...

Until finally, once again, events made me realize how horrible an employee, spouse, and parent I had become through nothing but sloth. Praying even felt like something to be ashamed of. Finally, I said to hell with it all. I got rid of my most useless ""hobby"" stuff, all the digital religious literature I'd accumulated, scrapped my app, and resolved that if it comes between me and my family, it has to go--religion included. If God wants me to talk to him or read up on him, he's going to have to magically change me, or tell me directly what to do. I won't waste time mumbling at him (whether pretty words out of a book or whiny, halting words from my own brain) or reading about him when I have things I need to be doing. I even know that God doesn't want me to, anyway. Since then, I have not prayed, read the Bible, or indulged in any of my other pastimes, and have never felt more on-track (notwithstanding the time I took to write this post).

And yet, this still feels like a mistake. **What's a healthy way to stay in touch with the Lord without letting it become a dissipation?** You have the Divine Liturgy and a rich, ancient prayer tradition to stay connected to the ancient faith, but as an Evangelical, liturgical private practice is it for me. Again, Orthodoxy has thrived under emperors, caliphs, sultans, chairmen, and dictators--surely there is some wisdom to be found somewhere on that subject.",OrthodoxChristianity

Does the justice of God come out from the love of God or are they different attributes perfectly balanced? Why?,vlakiades,1610594478,"Do you agree with the teaching of Saint Isaac of Syria?:

‚Äú[T]hose who are punished in Gehenna are scourged by the scourge of love. Nay, what is so bitter and vehement as the torment of love? I mean that those who have become conscious that they have sinned against love suffer greater torment from this than from any fear of punishment. For the sorrow caused in the heart by sin against love is more poignant than any torment. It would be improper for a man to think that sinners in Gehenna are deprived of the love of God. Love is the offspring of knowledge of the truth which, as is commonly confessed, is given to all. The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners, even as happens here when a friend suffers from a friend; but it becomes a source of joy for those who have observed its duties. Thus I say that this is the torment of Gehenna: bitter regret.‚Äù [11]

Is the Greek Orthodox Church my best option?,OrthPol,1610591797,"Hello all,

I'm a theological convert to Orthodoxy but have yet to be baptized. Following a friend's advice, I was looking to be baptized into the Greek Orthodox church but have come across some concerning stories.

I think the Greek Orthodox church may be going a bit woke. Stories of worshipers being thrown out of services for not wearing a mask and seminars about the dangers of climate change have me unsettled. Perhaps the most concerning thing I saw coming out of the Greek Orthodox Church (in Australia) was a seminar called ""the importance of science"" in the context of climate change and masks. I find this concerning because it seems to align with the secular/liberal misunderstanding of science - a near-religious worldview. 

I'm scared I'll be baptized into a church that will fall out of communion with the rest of Eastern Orthodoxy.

Confession is so important,AstronomerOk4608,1610555430,"I started using an Orthodox prayer book (I'm a non-denominational Christian), and I have to say that the prayers are powerful. Since I come from a baptist background, confession was not a big thing for me growing up. Prayer life consisted of thanksgiving, praising, and praying for good things to happen like good health, help in a career or relationships, etc. I didn't really bother to confess because it wasn't required, and I thought that I was already justified through Jesus' sacrifice. 

Well, now I see why confession is so important. In the prayer I said last night, it talked about confessing all sorts of sins like getting upset with someone, or not giving to a beggar, losing one's temper, gossip, etc. As human beings, we are so sinful. I used to be turned off on how much Catholics would call themselves sinners, because I thought that I was seen as perfect in God's eyes through Jesus who covered me with His righteousness. 

Now I'm realizing that actually.... I am a sinner! And admitting this and confessing my sins is a sign of humility and faith. I have faith that God will forgive me of these sins, I have faith that Jesus will transform my heart to be more like His. Confessing my sins is making me more humble because I'm learning that we have all fallen short of the glory of God -- who am I to judge someone else? As Jesus said, why do you point out the speck in your brother's eye while ignoring the plank in your own? 

And instead of feeling guilty and shameful, I actually feel more free and at peace. Because i'm leaning on Jesus to guide me in my everyday life. How wonderful is the love of God!!",OrthodoxChristianity

Jesus truly heals,AstronomerOk4608,1610482220,"I'll preface by saying that I am currently a non-denominational Christian, who is very interested in Orthodoxy. I lived a very sinful life, I was a complete hedonist, slept around a lot, got drunk all the time, and practiced whatever self-indulgence I wanted. This was due to some traumatic events that happened to me, I had undiagnosed PTSD, and I was your classic PTSD patient trying to self-medicate with vices. Once I started my weekly therapy and began to acknowledge the pains that happened to me, I began to have full-on panic attacks on an almost weekly basis and I began missing work because of my panic attacks. I hated myself so much. I wanted to die. This lasted for most of last year until early December.

I finally said, God, I confess my sins to you. I'm sorry for my pride in thinking that I could heal myself and thinking that I knew what was best for me. I give my pain, my suffering and my sins to you. Please forgive me, please heal me. I need You.

And then I believe it was the Holy Spirit who touched me, because I felt compelled to read the story of the Samaritan woman at the well. Jesus acknowledged her sin (but didn't condemn), invited her to drink from the water of life, and revealed Himself to her. I was just like this woman! It wasn't therapy, radical feminism, marxism, and exercise that I needed... It was Jesus all along.

And thus began my beautiful faith journey. Now I have finally opened my heart to invite Jesus back into my life and actually live out my faith. I confessed my sins, repented, and I have been praying (I've been trying an orthodox prayer book every night too!), reading my Bible, discussing with different believers, and researching in order to have more Jesus. This faith journey has led me to Catholicism and Orthodoxy. The more I dove into Catholicism, the more I just couldn't accept some practices and theology they adhered to. So that left me with Orthodoxy.

I have an orthodox friend and she is really knowledgeable on theology, we had a long chat on the phone yesterday and she gave me a lot of resources to learn more. She said she'll take me with her to the divine liturgy once churches are open again (they are closed to visitors because of COVID). In the meantime, she invited me to watch it online.

I think I am very keen on joining the Orthodox Church, but I still want to keep praying to God for discernment because I know that this is not a decision to take lightly. Some of the theology is very difficult to wrap my head around as someone with a baptist background, and I have been wrestling with this, but I do want to live out God's will and keep learning and have an open heart.

To me it seems very mixed.

There are saints such as St Cyprian who say that there is not salvation outside of the Church because salvation IS the church.

Then we have people like Fr seraphim Rose of blessed memory who says that it would be extremely difficult to be saved outside of the Church, when we consider how hard it is to be saved in the church, and that we ought not to concern ourselves with the salvation of others, but with our own salvation.

What happens to unjustified excommunicated people in the afterlife?,JamieOfArc,1610379338,"In the 17th century, the Orthodox Church in Russia excommunicated so called ""old believers"" who opposed certain liturgy reforms (it had nothing to do with theology or doctrine afaik). 1971 these excommunications were taken back by Moscow and the liturgy of the old believers was accepted by the mainstream church. Now the old believers that died prior to 1971 died not in communion with the church but their excommunication was unjustified.

Baptism and John's insert,Jonikster,1610348796,"We are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:

Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Matthew 28:19.

But!

If you learn the Bible, nowhere in the Bible you will find baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit!

Peter replied, ‚ÄúRepent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38.

They had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Acts 8:16.

So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Acts 10:48.

They were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Acts 19:5.

Did the apostles violate what Jesus instructed them?

But we can find a contradiction in the words of Jesus too.

But you are not to be called Teachers, for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. Matthew 23:8.

That is, Jesus tells them not to be called teachers. And in Matthew 28:19 ask them to become teachers.

&amp;#x200B;

There are recognized later insertions in the Bible. For example, John's insert:

For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. 1 John 5:7.

In the existing New Testament manuscripts and in the testimonies of the Church Fathers earlier than the 4th century, the text of the John Insertion is missing. At the end of the II century, Tertullian, arguing the concept of the Trinity (Tert. Adversus Praxean, 25:1, ¬´Qui tres unum sunt, non unus¬ª), quotes other passages in the New Testament (including the First Epistle of John many times, but doesn't mention this phrase). Origen, Augustine, Clement of Alexandria and Athanasius of Alexandria (III-IV centuries) don't cite this phrase in polemics and, therefore, don't know about it. For example, Augustine in his work ""Against the Arianine Maximinus"" quotes only verse 1 John. 5:8, and without the words ""on earth"".

An expression close to the ""John's Insertion"" is found in the middle of the 3rd century in the Holy Martyr Cyprian of Carthage, in the work ""On the Unity of the Church"" (De unitate ecclesiae), although hes text is not identical:

Dicit Dominus: Ego et Pater unum sumus, et iterum de Patre et Filio et Spiritu sancto scriptum est: Et tres unim sunt.

The earliest direct evidence of the ""John's Insertion"" was found by historians in the Latin writer heresiarch Priscillian at the end of the 4th century, in the work ¬´Liber apologeticus. 1. 4, 18:6¬ª:

‚Ä¶tria sunt quae testimonium dicunt in terra aqua caro et sanguis et haec tria in unum sunt, et tria sunt quae testimonium dicent in caelo pater uerbum et spiritus et haec tria unum sunt in Christo Iesu.

For this reason, the authoritative biblical textual scholar Bruce Metzger considers Priscillian to be the author of the phrase, William Barkley agrees in his commentary. Most likely, this phrase first appeared in the form of a commentary in the margins (marginals) in one of the copies of the manuscript of the First Epistle of John, and then, during the next correspondence, was included in the main text.

There is no ‚ÄúJohn's Insertion‚Äù in the earliest texts of the First Epistle of John in the original language (Greek), namely, in the Sinai, Vatican and Alexandrian codes; and also in the Vulgate of Jerome, in the Syrian Peshitta, in the Syrian Philoxena-Garclay collection, and in the Coptic texts. It's not found in the writings of the Greek authors citing this epistle and living before the Council of Nicea in 325, as well as in all translations into Coptic, Ethiopian, Arabic and Slavic languages up to the 16th century.

Why did I say about this insert?

If we don't find in the Bible baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and the Apostles baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, maybe Matthew 28:19 is the same late insertion?",OrthodoxChristianity

This dissatisfaction got me reading more into church history and the different traditions within Christianity, so naturally I was exposed to Orthodoxy.

I have begun to look more into it, and have been swept away by the beauty and tradition. Not to mention have been convinced that you guys simply have better theology.

However, since I am an American, there are no Orthodox parishes around me. In fact, none of my Christian friends have even heard of the EO Church.

A confused Christian,AstronomerOk4608,1610295803,"Hello brothers and sisters in Christ! I'm a non-denominational Christian, and I have posted here a couple times in the past. I feel very confused as to which church to belong to. I tried to watch the Divine liturgy of a local Orthodox church online (as my city is under lockdown and we can't go to churches), and I will be honest, I did not understand what was happening. It was also very difficult to stay concentrated. They were also speaking some Arabic I believe, so I didn't understand that even more. I watched an online mass from a Catholic church last Sunday, and I found that was easier for me to understand. However, I find that I just get confused the more I think about which church to follow. I find that I have the most peace when I am just reading the Bible and praying. I'm also reading Confessions by St Augustine and it has been a real joy for me, it feels like I'm reading the Psalms and I feel that I relate so much to St Augustine. 

There are doctrines in Catholicism that I don't agree with, such as confessing to a priest, papal supremacy, and the concept of mortal sin and going to hell if you don't confess. However, I find myself drawn to catholic saints. I said a Hail Mary the other day and I felt much better after. I have also been reading about female Catholic saints, and this has also brought me much comfort and inspiration to follow Jesus. 

This also sounds really trivial, but I think I feel more comfortable with Catholicism because my parents are from a Catholic country, and where I live, there are lots of (albeit non-practicing) Catholics. Orthodoxy is very new to me, so it's kind of intimidating to explore if that makes sense. I never even knew about Orthodoxy until my cousin who is thinking of converting, introduced it to me. 

I shared my struggles with finding a church to my weekly prayer group. They are all protestants. One member actually sent me a video about a muslim who converted to Christianity, and she told me not to lose faith. I think to her, exploring catholicism or orthodoxy is heresy and means completely leaving the Christian faith. 

So my problem right now is that both the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches say that they are THE Apostolic Church. How do I know which Church is the ""one""? And does it matter?

Depression is telling everything is pointless after two years of living without it.

While treating depression with medication and therapy is a must and I have experienced some traumatic things in my childhood, apart from all that I do know I lack faith and spirituality - even in the most broad sence of the word. I am a non-believer, although I identify culturally as Orthodox and Christian. I have wished many times to become a believer, but unfortunately I am not. I have read, though, how many people have found God at a certain point in their life, I wish that could happen with me as well. I am not gonna lie why I long for that - I have no purpose and stand for nothing in this life - but I do want to have a meaningful life. Many say you make your own meaning by taking responsibility (f.e. prof. Jordan b Peterson) for your life, for your loved ones, etc., which is great, but there is some emptiness, lack of spirituality inside me that needs to be somehow filled.

He, as the Apostle Paul tells us today, descended to earth to save the afflicted man. To preach what God is and what he asks of man. That God is spirit, eternal and immortal and is not pleased with material sacrifices, but with spiritual worship, which springs from a pure heart and intellect. Man after the original sin was turned away from the true God and led to idolatry. From this darkness of idolatry Christ freed man and made him again a beloved child of God by grace.

Thinking of converting to Orthodoxy.,MTA3235,1610271842,"Hello, I'm a 20 year old maronite catholic, and I would consider myself devout though unfortunately not very practicing, partly because of laziness, but also partly because I have been increasingly growing further and further from papal culture and doctrine. Through out my relatively short life I have went through many philosophical and religious stages which have made me the man I am today, some were dark and some were bright, but I would not wish it to be any other way as they have taught me what I know today. The reason I'm thinking of conversion is because of doctrinal differences and ceremonial aspects of orthodox prayers/masses I have found to be much more spiritually fulfilling.    

1) In terms of theological differences. Before getting into the changing of the creed, which I agree is heretical, filioque is illogical. First, although Christ has the spirit of God, and since what has the spirit of God is in essence, God, I think there is a temporal error in saying the Spirit proceeds from both the father AND the Son. It could be that it proceeds continuously from the Father into the Son as St. Maximus thinks of it, but I have yet to really scratch my brain around it. The question of false translation is an even bigger problem. In not only changes the religious method, but also jeopardizes all the councils on which our faith is based, which leads me to my second problem...   

2) Papal primacy. What can I say about this which hasn't already been said a million times. The pope is a MAN, prone to error and sometimes, as history and even modern times have shown, he is perhaps the WORST person to judge in terms of matters of doctrine. Without listing the popes which have not only be factually mistaken but also literal demons, whom the Vatican still refuses to acknowledge as doctrinally erroneous, it does not take much brain power to know that popes, or any person in a religious position is at a very prone to corruption, as is the case today, as was the case through history. Indulgences, the sack of Constantinople, the Falsification of the Creed.... are all results of papal sins.   

 3) Orthodox masses vs Catholic masses. This is perhaps a more personal and subjective point, which some of you might think is silly, but Orthodox churches have generally filled me spiritually in a way catholic masses haven't. Without saying too much on this subject, I think most of you would understand.  

These are currently my main reasons. I wanted an opinion on converting with these philosophical/theological convictions of mine.   

Also what are perhaps the best steps to go through this? Like do I go to a parish and just to talk to a priest and explain my situation and mental thoughts?",OrthodoxChristianity

"Best resources on the concept of theosis/having strong doubts, how to discuss with my priest?",soulsilver_goldheart,1610251170,"Hello brothers and sisters, I may have been here before with similar doubts and problems, but I have lately been struggling with the fundamental aspect of Christianity that I hold so dear: the doctrine of theosis, especially as it relates to the Church body.

I have not been able to go to Church in so long, which makes me very depressed. COVID has separated me from my spiritual community. I feel lethargic, and I have had horrible doubts and fears. 

During this time, I've been confronted with very strong doubts about the transformative power of the faith. I'm uncertain about how Emperors Constantine and Justinian II could be saints. Yes, they preserved the Church, but I've read that they did things like boil pregnant women alive and massacre innocent people based on faith. How could I know for certain that these men were reaching union with God? We protect and cherish the life of the unborn. We condemn all forms of violence. It's terrifying to me how being so religious didn't prevent them from this.

I've read about Bulgaria's complicit behavior with the Holocaust, and the Circassian genocide against Muslims in the Balkans, the protocols of Zion. The way that homosexuals are killed in Eastern Europe. It's not the peaceful pacifism we espouse. How can the faith not prevent this?

I know that other faiths have histories of violence. I do not excuse the ethnic cleansing of the modern nation of Israel, or the persecutions of Christians by Islamic governments, or the persecution of the Church under the USSR. I condemn all of this violence. But it's not Judaism, Islam, or atheism that I put my trust in, or even Roman Catholicism or the Protestant faiths. It is uniquely Orthodoxy. And so I despair at the ways the faith hasn't prevented such corruption.

I've seen and read such wisdom from the Saints and Desert Fathers and Mothers, but it's so hard to hold onto my faith in light of historical events, and also negative experiences of people within the Church. Prayer and reflection has certainly made me humble. Yet I remain unsure.

I have heard that many enlightened saints saw only their own sin, so maybe I should not despair at this uncertain and be glad that I am not self-righteous. But I struggle to see the light.

I want to speak with my priest about my doubts, but I am afraid of hurting his feelings. I also have not been able to see him in person for a long time.",OrthodoxChristianity

I was watching a video online and it claimed that Jesus was not the messiah according to ancient Jewish tradition. I had always known that Jewish people didn't believe he was but I had never actually heard it said out loud like that and it just got my mind into working overtime. I know that the Bible was written over thousands of years by many different people with their own agendas and audiences, and that it was first organized over a century after Jesus had ascended to heaven. There's also the issue of translations and schisms....the Bible has been translated several times and some things can get lost in translation and whole books are cut out, depending on which Bible you're reading. 

How do we know if the editors of the Bible didn't purposefully cut out or change certain prophecies because it would've conflicted with the narrative of Jesus being the messiah?

View of the Cross,ColoradoMinesCole,1610207267,"Hello Orthodox brothers and sisters,

I have heard that the Eastern Orthodox Church (not sure about Oriental) takes the view that Christ's work on the cross should **not** be seen as a judicial act (aka penal substitution). This does not seem right to me. Reading Paul's letters, the book of Revelation, and especially Isaiah 53 convince me that concepts like penal substitution do have an extremely strong scriptural basis. This has me confused why many within the Eastern Orthodox Church deny this aspect of the cross so strongly. 

I have come into agreement with many other teachings of the Eastern Orthodox Church, but I am not sure if I can become Orthodox if there is not a good explanation for this specific issue. At the moment, it seems like the EOC is denying parts of scripture (I know this can't be true, but that is how it seems to me currently and is why I am asking for an explanation)

Question about Orthodox Salvation,polymorphic0,1610121329,"So I'm not Orthodox, but am Christian (Protestant in practice, but more Romish in theology). I've been reading some of the comments here and the impression I get is that salvation is not as simple as *Soli Fide*, *Soli Gratias*.

So my understanding is that salvation is completely wrought by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and that belief/ faith in Him is the only means of salvation. 

- ‚ÄúFor by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God‚Äî not because of works, lest any man should boast.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠(Ephesians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠2:8-9‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠RSV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨)

- ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠(John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠3:16‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠RSV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨)

- ‚ÄúWhile we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.‚Äù
(‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Romans‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠5:6‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠RSV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨)

So I'll admit that my viewpoint of salvation may be fairly Protestant, and I understand that our faith should spur us to action as per (James 2:17), but my understanding is that lively faith in the Christ produces works of love naturally, and that it's not a symbiotic relationship of works of love *and* faith in the Christ that works salvation. Is this not the Orthodox perspective?

Do the Orthodox believe in a more complete relation of sanctification and justification (e.g. that only those who will go on to be sanctified will recieve justification?)

Just curious. Thanks in advance!",OrthodoxChristianity
A rant about Atheism and why Christianity is true,falcoistop2melee,1610112506,"Atheism is really stupid.  Its literally a conspiracy theory that relies on ridiculous chances of us being where we are today, meanwhile the Bible is historically true, and makes actual sense for today.  For why I think Atheism is dumb, it relies on first the big bang theory, but how could the big bang theory exist without anything? The big bang is reliant on something that's impossible.  Secondly there's a reason why this is called a theory, it can't and hasn't been verified to be true.  It'a just people who are egotistical who have 1 bad experience in life half the time and are like MY LIFE ISN'T PERFECT SO THERE CAN'T BE A GOD.  It's people who are corrupt by the devil who think that religion is out against them, and to that I don't understand. Christianity is only giving good things if you believe and are a good person.  People who think it's just a trick to make people nice don't understand that nobody was smart enough back then to enough think of that.  Even then, they were much more brutal back then so why would a large group of people do something that doesn't have to do with h supporting violence?   Why I KNOW Christianity is true, historically accurate as it is verified by MANY historians to be true.  Secondly, 12 people saw God (aka Jesus) die on the Cross for our sins, and has been written by many people so it's not made up by 1 person.  Thirdly, (and I understand if you don't believe me on this one) my parents, and I have experienced miracles that will never be explained by science.  For my parents: they saw me as a baby running across the room laughing as a baby taking clothes out from the drawers and laughing, (they weren't on drugs, living healthy life styles and my mother wasn't pregnant yet).  10 months later I was born and not only did I look the EXACT SAME but I also always laughed ran and took out the clothes.  For a miracle with me: (I have plenty of times I can mention but this one is my favorite) When I was 5, I saw an angel and that's the day I can remember being on earth. Hear me out, (I remember this like it was yesterday) when I was 5 I remember feeling alive in the most literal sense like as if God put my soul in a body, and I saw an angel who was very beautiful very tall had amazing eyes etc.  Then I was in bed in a situation where I was about to go to bed, all I felt was love, and I was not hallucinating because at the time I was awake and I was healthy according to my family so God gave me an experience of his love at 5. Fourthly, we have people who have went to heaven when dead and came back.  There are many videos and I'll edit in a link when I'm done but basically the gist Is, people have died for MUCH over the limit of hallucinations after death so they legitimately saw heaven.  If I'm not mistaken it's about 12 minutes for the absolute limit where oxygen is inside the brain and you can create hallucinations.  They've seen God and people who've barely read scripture, and knew nothing about heaven saw a white light from the animals eyes in heaven which is said in the Bible Matthew 17:2 There he was transfigured before them.  His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.  All the experiences go hand in hand with the Bible and MANY people have seen this and come back after 12 minutes so it's not just 1 or 2 people.  This is why I believe in Christianity, why I believe atheism is stupid, and this isn't even all the evidence for going with Christianity unlike Atheism where they claim to have evidence and proof and then literally give no counterpoint.  I've studied both sides and I don't understand how people can still think that Christ is fake.",OrthodoxChristianity

"Orthodox doctrine, morality, and authority",digitalpesto,1610049499,"I was having a discussion with someone recently who claims to be Eastern Orthodox, but also believes early abortions, premarital sex, and homosexual sex are all morally acceptable. I'm Catholic, and have always been under the impression that Eastern Orthodox Church believes most of the same doctrines the Catholic Church does, and holds to the same moral values. I tried pointing out that EO beliefs contradict his own, which seems to be the case from what I've read, but he says some churches and priests believe differently than him and some don't, that scripture is misinterpreted, and the priests he knows aren't as pharisaical as that.
Looking at abortion in particular, I read that there was a synod in Greece this year in which the bishops declared that life begins at Conception, and abortion is murder.

How much wiggle room is there for personal opinion on moral issues like this? In Catholicism, we would say it's contrary to Sacred Tradition and to official Church teaching, so holding to such views would be heretical and a denial of the Catholic Faith. I know the EO would point to it being contrary to Tradition also, but are different churches allowed to put their own spin on Scripture and Tradition, adapting it to the times, or is he way off base? I know there are plenty of nominal members of Catholicism as well, so I suspect this is the case, but I wanted to get some other opinions.

Also, does a synod like the aforementioned need to be obeyed, or is a priest or bishop allowed to hold a different opinion? I was researching that also, and it sounded like the Mind of the Church had to be unanimous on it? It sounded kind of gray, I wasn't sure what exactly that meant.",OrthodoxChristianity

"""Prayers to"" Mary (Theotokos) &amp; Saints",unorthodoxmonk,1609953076,"I feel compelled to ""let you people know"" this, and perhaps any resulting discussion will somehow wind up being worthwhile, if even to only a slight degree and to myself (though certainly hopefully for others, but who knows).

I have, several times over a good many years, been inspired to look into and spend some time with Orthodoxy in various ways (I do not have a church nearby, nor transportation to get to the nearest (about an hour), and also now have serious health issues that prevent me from being able to go to places farther than ""just up the road"", and even then only at certain unpredictable and short lived opportunities). At any rate, I enjoy listening to Orthodox monks/priests/etc. on YouTube, Ancient Faith, and other more random spots here and there, and have gained many worthwhile insights that help greatly in my personal walk with God.

Over the course of these studies and such I have had a handful of primary issues with Orthodoxy, one being the ""praying to"" Mary (Theotokos) and the Saints, thinking that nothing makes any sense whatsoever other than praying directly to God/Jesus, and anything outside of that sounding at least questionable with regard to idolatry and such. Yet suddenly, just a short bit ago while trying to walk around the yard for what little bit of exercise I am capable of, during which I typically repeat the Lord's Prayer, sometimes the Jesus Prayer, or other just general praying, I felt, very deeply, compelled to ask Jesus' earthly Mother and the Saints to pray for me, and it just all made incredibly beautiful sense to my deepest self, without any need to wreck it all up with intellectual picking apart. I could ""feel and see"" the Saints, from all history and beyond, surrounding God. I sensed that it also acknowledges validation for the sacrifices/struggles they made/went through in order to become Saints themselves, and as I've read so many times when looking into this aspect, it certainly shouldn't hurt to have such beings praying for you.

I felt, at that moment, that I'd just made a profound step towards Orthodoxy in a very organic way. I do wish I were able to attend and go deeper/further, but at least presently it seems impossible. God willing, if I am able to overcome these health issues (8 months now, 3 trips to ER, 2 CT scans, multiple blood works, a few other tests, one significant hospital procedure, they do not have any idea what it is, what is causing it), and become physically able once again, I will find a way to at the very least visit with an Orthodox church and ""come and see"". As for now, I will continue in my studies and implement this new (to me) element into my prayer life.

Bless you all for the value of contributions I have gotten from people within your community over these years. I can remember when (I do not think) there was any /r/OrthodoxChristianity, nor many Orthodox at /r/Christianity at all, and it seemed that /u/Silouan was, at least seemingly to me back then, the lone representative for turning us onto it and answering questions, etc. Things have really blossomed profoundly since then, and I always get a lot from my periodic check ins.

Feeling unwelcome,kookiemarie,1609935999,"We all know that the Orthodox Church is seperated on ethnic lines. Growing up I never really identified with my ethnic background and at times it stopped me from identifying with church. For the last year I stopped going to church because every Sunday felt like mental warfare. 

A new church has started near where I live. This church is supposed to be an Orthodox Church with no cultural boundaries which is mutlicultural and open to all. Sounds great. Me and my partner had been there once before and good friends of ours were going for Christmas mass so we decided to go there to. 

We arrived at the door and asked if we had registered. We said no sorry. We were told limited space due to COVID but that they‚Äôd let us in this one time and asked us to sit at the back corner in the outside area. No worries. 

Mass finished and we were talking with people outside. I can see the priest talking with my partner I think nothing of it. 

As we‚Äôre walking out my partner tells me the priest asks if we had registered. He says no sorry we will next time. He said the church attendance is restricted to ‚Äúmulticultural couples only‚Äù (me and my partner are from the same culture). He asks whether this is just for COVID and the priest says always been the rule and suggests other churches in the area. 

I was outraged when I heard this. There are PLENTY of couples and families who come from the same background attending the church. The priest pointed out that some of the people are mixed race but all these people grew up in the church the same way I did. The other same cultural couples are ‚Äúserving‚Äù so it‚Äôs okay. 

I just feel disheartened. I never related to the church because partly due to culture. A church advertises itself as being non cultural and I am told I‚Äôm the wrong culture and to please go somewhere else.

In this country there's a catholic church in every village (literally), but other religions don't have as many followers to be everywhere. 
So my question is, could I be a part of EOC even if I can't go to a church?

"I don't understand ""salvation"" and forgiveness in the Orthodox faith...",AstronomerOk4608,1609879401,"Hi fellow brothers and sisters in Christ! I am currently a non-denominational Christian, looking to explore the Orthodox faith. I want to follow and worship Jesus as He intends for me to, and after looking into Church history, I have narrowed it down to being a Catholic vs Orthodox. One thing that is really difficult for me to wrap my head around is not knowing if one is saved. As a protestant, we believe that once you are saved, you are always saved. You will know if you are saved by your works, which is a natural result of faith and the Holy Spirit working in you. So if you have no works, then there is no faith to begin with. 

As for the Orthodox faith, I feel confused about how salvation and forgiveness work. It sounds like nobody ever knows if they are saved, and they are working towards their salvation? I have tried searching online and on this subreddit (I contacted a priest, I'm waiting for him to reply), but it's just confusing me even more. If Orthodox don't believe that we are fully forgiven through Jesus' death, how does forgiveness work? How does salvation work? I understand why it's important to confess your sins, so that we can be continuously sanctified, but I always believed that God sees us as He sees Jesus -- holy and perfect -- once we accept Jesus as Lord and Saviour because without Jesus, it's impossible to live up to the standard of God. To me (and my apologies if i'm wrong), it sounds like we have to work for our salvation in the Orthodox faith. That does not make sense to me because what was the point in Jesus coming to earth then, if that was the case? 

Thank you and God bless you all!!",OrthodoxChristianity

"Christ is at War with Death, and we Should be too",aletheia,1609859201,"*""The last enemy to be destroyed is death."" -St. Paul; 1 Corinthians 15:26*

This is going to be yet another post about science, COVID-19, and the Church. There seems to be a misconception that ""science"" tells us something about ethics or other 'oughts' - this misconception seems to be in place both among those who believe science is a useful way of gaining knowledge and among those who think science is a conspiracy. This is my attempt to dispel that misconception.

Science, generally speaking, gives answers to questions in the form of ""If this, then that."" In the present situation, we get things like this: ""If we take no protective measures, than X people are likely to die of COVID-19"" or ""If we wear masks, Y people are likely to die."" Science takes data and produces a predicted outcome of a subsequent trial.

What science cannot answer is ""Is burdening people with a mask mandate the right thing to do?"" or ""Is requiring a mask an infringement on civil liberties?"" or ""Is it an acceptable loss for X people to asphyxiate to death when we could have taken action to prevent it?"" Those are questions we have to answer as a community. They're ethical and philosophical questions. They're not scientific questions. Science cannot tell you the value of a human life, or of a Divine Liturgy.

Now, scientists are not somehow untouched by ethics. Scientists absolutely have ethical opinions, and they're free to share those opinions. Scientists are as varied in their ethical opinions as any other group of people. There are many forms of research you cannot do without ethical oversight of an outside body. These ethical protections are in place due to unscrupulous scientists committing or being ordered to commit atrocities. Sometimes ethics get violated by accident; the Standford Prison experiment was cancelled because things went off the rails. Science did not stop the experiment - ethics did.

Now, to bring this full circle: What kinds of things can science tell us about the COVID0-19 vaccine? It can tell us is prevents COVID-19 X% of the time. It can tell us that if we vaccinate Y% of the people then the reproduction rate will be reduced to Z. It can tell us that side effects happen at such-and-such a rate. What can it not tell us? It cannot tell us whether we ought to get the vaccine. It cannot tell us if we should desire to end the spread of this disease. Science does not recommend this or that action. It can only give a prediction of the outcomes of those actions. The scientists, to the degree they constitute a community (and again, there are as many scientific communities as there are religions), can give their ethical opinion. Other communities, such as the Church, also ought to weigh in on the oughts. I think the ethical choice for Christians is obvious, though: Christ is at war with death. We should be, too.",OrthodoxChristianity
Can Vegetarianism/Veganism today be justified through the Bible and/or the Church Fathers?,cataractum,1609848151,"Question largely in the title but - are there any works/sermons/books/anything which outlines the argument or teaching that vegetarianism/veganism *would* be justifiable, or even recommended, per Christian teaching? 

This would hinge, i think, on how meat is produced today under an increasingly industrialised, commoditised and profit-driven process. Basically, animals are no longer animals but commodities treating inhumanely. As opposed to pre-modernity where you would raise and slaughter as needed.

As an example: Muslims and Jews allow Halal/Kosher meat, but have arguments which justify vegetarianism on the basis that ritual slaughter is not just ticking a box - it's ensuring the meat consumed is raised and slaughtered responsibly. Halal meat, even if slaughtered per the rules, isn't halal if it's part of the industrialised manufacturing process where animals are raised inhumanely as commodities only to be slaughtered as efficiently as possible.

Insanely frustrated...,Musty-Meerkat123,1609795178,"I‚Äôve been Orthodox for over two years now. I‚Äôm the only religious person in my family and have never come across a single Orthodox person outside church. For many, many months I‚Äôve been so frustrated and defeated. My parish is just the last straw. 

My priest is never available and doesn‚Äôt answer my emails or calls. When some parishioners asked to have a Bible study or catechism, he openly berated them for not knowing ‚Äúbasic‚Äù things like essence/energies and homoousios/homoiousios. Several of them either left the church or the Church. A couple people have left for other parishes when he tried to baptize/chrismate them after 2-3 months of catechism. They told him they weren't ready, he never provided books or meetings or checked on them. Nothing. Told them to find someone else to teach them when asked. (Which is how my catechism went, too‚Ä¶) 

And then there‚Äôs this disconnect between what I read and practice. I come from a Muslim/agnostic background. When I asked the priest how to fast/pray, he only said, ‚ÄúDo what you can,"" and never replied to my questions/concerns. Just shrugged and walked off. Feels like I'm running in circles. Two other parishes near me haven‚Äôt been better. I don‚Äôt have enough fingers and toes to count the number of people who flat-out told me I‚Äôm not welcome for not being X. Lots of parishioners openly making racist comments and slurs. A yiayia even blocked and ""bounced"" me from the entrance once - even after I told her I was Orthodox. I tried to wait it out for over a year at these parishes, but if anything it‚Äôs even worse. 

I‚Äôm going *nuts!* Only prayer and the sheer hope that things will get better keep me from leaving the Church altogether. I don‚Äôt expect people to be perfect by any means, but *come. on.* Feel so guilty saying this, but I‚Äôm so happy to be stuck at home praying Typica. It's much easier to find Jesus in my icon corner at home than at Liturgy where the prayers are drowned out by gossip and sports. But lots of nights I kinda break down crying over it all.

Reflections from the Nativity Fast,SSPXarecatholic,1609709960,"Christ is Born! This Nativity fast I took it upon myself to read two books about a topic that I have been wrestling with for quite some time. The first was the ever controversial book by David Bentley Hart *That All Shall Be Saved* and another book in a similar vein but also very different by a Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar called *Dare We Hope ""That All Men Be Saved?""* (including his short discourse on hell). This is going to be fairly long, but I hope for some of you it is instructive or helpful or at the very least moderately interesting. 

Right off the bat, this isn't really a post trying to debunk or advocate for any specific position, I think we have had *more* than enough of those posts on this sub. I just wanted to share my thoughts about how they have impacted my perspective on life and my spirituality. I enjoyed both books a lot more than I had anticipated, in particular DBH's book. I'm sure many of you will know I have been fairly hard on DBH in the past and I felt in many ways ashamed of my behavior towards him and his ideas after reading his book. Balthasar's book was one that had been on my radar for some time after I saw a video of Bishop Barron referencing both DBH and also on Balthasar's book and his own perspective on the matter of universal salvation. I never really gave it much thought but soon after finishing *TASBS* I knew I was going to have to read what Balthasar had to say on the subject, particularly for his more unique perspective on the matter.

**A General Overview**

I suppose I should start off with *TASBS*. This book was enjoyable, if not for it's beautiful appraisal of God's total victory over sin, death, and the devil, then certainly for it's utter evisceration of the reformed Calvinist theology (if we can even call such a heinous set of doctrines true theology). Like a spectator in the coliseum I cheered as Hart mercilessly ripped apart the most diabolical and sinister doctrines of Calvin and his ilk. It was a glorious sight to behold to see someone well-versed in the Calvinist tradition take it to count on every aspect of it's persuasion. This book is worthwhile for this alone. In fact, it seems as though most of the book is centered around this Augustinian tradition that Calvinism grew out of (and even Thomism) and has much less to do with the actual meat of what universal salvation really means. I for one didn't particularly feel attacked as someone who is technically an infernalist (more on that later) because I always found, even in my protestant days, that Calvinism was a disgusting way of understanding Christ's actions on the cross and how God interacted with his creation; that is, as a cold despot arbitrarily dishing out blessing and punishment on those whom he favored or hated on that particular day. Even in my reading of Aquinas and Anselm I was always perturbed by their candid matter-of-fact view which decided to rend apart God's mercy and judgement preferring to attribute punishment to justice, exclusively, and forgiveness to mercy, again exclusively. Moreover, Aquinas' grim view that the felicity of the elect was only further enhanced by watching the writhing suffering of the damned always seemed to me to be absolutely foreign to any sense of intuitive human decency and the Gospel message more specifically.

As far as *Dare We Hope*, I found myself cheering less and pondering more. This book was a much more sober approach to the question at hand, and in the end I found it to be downright beautiful. After putting down the book I found myself filled with a deep sense of hope, and also a newfound perspective of our blessed Lord. Looking at the crucifix in my icon corner I couldn't help but recite endlessly those beautiful words recorded in John's Gospel, ""And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."" Balthasar really brought home the point that there is without a doubt absolutely *no* lengths that our God will not go to gather his children back to himself. In fact, Balthasar claims that for God, the company of the elect would be too small if even one were left outside. He goes to great pains to explain why hell is real, similar to Hart, but departs when he says that it's eternality is a real option for any of us. As opposed to Hart, Balthasar's proposition is not whether an eternal hell exists or not, but whether, out of Christian charity we can hope that in the end it will be empty.

**Tone**

The tone of these two books are night and day. While I enjoyed Harts bombastic dismantling of Calvinism the book, for many, will be almost unreadable because of how arrogant he is. Hart never stops to consider that he could be wrong. He plows ahead with a certain dauntless philosophical daring that even if you already agreed with him you might ask him to exercise even the most modest modicum of restraint. The fact is, is that Hart, by his own admission, would *not* be a Christian if his brand of universalism were not the case. Whether the reader thinks such a position is tenable is another discussion entirely, but this brings me to my next point which is that Hart, as is evidenced by his book, is at heart a philosopher and not a theologian. On the other hand Balthasar, while certainly a philosophical thinker is writing a theological tract about the virtue of hope, not about the logical implications of an eternal hell. Balthasar comes across less, as Hart claims, as a creeping sniveling hoper of the possibility of universal restoration. Rather, his exercise of restraint goes hand in hand with his view that hope properly exercised does not presume upon the mercy and compassion of God. While Balthasar admits that he believes a salvation of all men would be the best and most suiting outcome for God, he also balances this with a view that he may not actually have the whole picture, and that perhaps some may, in the end be lost eternally (although he is uncertain as to how). Balthasar makes a restrained incursion into the theory that all in the end will be saved and is more like a canoe gently floating down a river of theological hope in a tentative exploration of a difficult topic. Hart, for better or worse, is an Apache attack helicopter blowing up and burning down any opposition he perceives to be in his way.

**Takeaways**

One of the reasons I really loved Balthasar's book had to do with his epilogue on the certitude of an apokatastasis panton. The final chapter of this deals with how we are to deal with actually teaching or preaching such a doctrine to the average lay faithful. Here we see the full display of his patristic insight no doubt acquired from his instructor, one of the initiators of the *ressourcement* in Catholicism Henri de Lubac. Balthasar essentially comes to the conclusion that even if we could be certain of such an eschatological outcome, when we begin to read from those most involved in it's theological development it is viewed as a doctrine which should be reserved only for those who are spiritually mature enough to properly understand it. I think many of us intuitively know this for any manner of mysteries that the faith has to offer. One need only to look at the conclusions drawn from the reality that the Logos manifested himself in creation through various beliefs and philosophies. Instead of rightly glorifying God for expressing his love for mankind to prepare all people to receive Christ we instead end up with the luke-warm drivel of perennialistic thought that all religions are fundamentally the same, and that all are worshipping/dealing with the same metaphysical reality. 

To further see this as the case, one need only look at the responses many Christians give if they are told universalism is in fact the case. Their objections range from a believe that there will be a loss of evangelical zeal, thinking that for evangelical purposes an eternal torment must await those who fail to accept Christ in this life. Less often, but still as such, many believe that the faithful would devolve into a life of pigs where the fire of their faith is warmed exclusively with the threat of hell-fire as opposed to the love of Christ. More to the point, Balthasar makes it clear that Origen, who writes on this topic extensively, is not gnostically trying to keep secret knowledge only for the spiritually enlightened. Furthermore, he emphasizes how Origen makes clear that all must pass through such fire and that the Lord will ""Stand in the river of fire near the flaming sword."" (Origen, Homilies on Luke) Sadly Balthasar has to mention this for those who, as Hart puts it, are like the mafioso who don't turn in evidence to the District Attorney thinking they can ""do the time."" Lamentably, it seems that the vast majority of Christians seem to think that hell is only threatening when it is eternal, scarcely recognizing that even if it is temporary, the NT imagery of what it will look like (again, even *if* temporary)  should be *more* than enough for one to be encouraged to work out his purification in this life.

That said, in the end, I think Balthasar's treatment of the issue was perhaps not more philosophically convincing than that of Hart's but it offers a place for us ""infernalists"" to rest in a great hope that God will restore all things. That the mountains will be leveled and that the valleys will be filled. I don't feel the need, as I did after finishing *TASBS*, that I must throw out my entire eschatological perspective and assume some neo-platonic perspective on the matter. Rather, I was left acknowledging my own lack of certainty of the eternal destiny of any (particularly my own), but also praising God for the fact that in the end God may truly be all in all.",OrthodoxChristianity

I have been taking lessons at my local Orthodox church and I love it, considering joining. I understand they teach they are THE church. I however also investigated Catholicism and their theory of Apostolic Succession, which hints *they* are THE church.

Some of you never seem to realize that you are likely somewhat culpable for their disinterest. Your own salvation is what should be taking up your time.

Hard Teachings,ColoradoMinesCole,1609609999,"Hello Orthodox brothers and sisters,

There are many things in Orthodox Christianity that are intriguing and good, such as the liturgy and worship. However, there are some teachings/beliefs that I don't think I can ever accept. 

1. The teaching that Mary lived a sinless life. I just don't see any reason why we should believe this. It seems like speculation at best, and quasi-heresy at it's worst. Unless it can be shown that this was taught by the Apostles, I cannot accept this.
2. Veneration of Saints. To me, this is fine when it is very low-level. However, I have seen this abused regularly (in my opinion) when I have looked into Orthodoxy, and I my personal conviction is that I can never begin venerating saints. 

I know there aren't really strong dogmas in Orthodoxy, so I was wondering if it is possible to become an Orthodox Christian while not practicing these teachings, as they don't really seem relevant to the main message of the Gospel. I.E. would I sort of be forced to venerate the saints or is that a personal choice?

Spiritual warfare tips!,NewAgeToJesus,1609599517,"Hello my name is Brian and I have been involved in spiritual warfare the past 4 years I am 24 now and have been successful in overcoming anger, depression, witchcraft and all things nasty. I just wanted to give my brothers and sisters a couple of tips that help me through it all! Now of course this was all possible through our Lord and savior Jesus Christ and the help of the holy spirit!

Tip 1: What ever negative emotions you are going through understand there is a demon behind it, you must bind up demons of anger, depression, anxiety, ect and cast them out in Jesus mighty name. And make sure to speak it with authority that we were given! 

 **2 Corinthians 10:4** 

 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds.

 Ephesians 6:12 

 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 

Luke 10:19

Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. 

Tip 2: Discouragement and fear comes from the devil! Anytime you feel discouraged where as if you are having trouble over coming habitual sin just know that Jesus is always there and he is looking at you with love and admiration! The devil will try to implant negativity and discouragement! The devil is a liar and keep your heads up! The devil is afraid and trembles just at the name of Jesus!

2 Timothy 1:7

For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. 

James 2:19

Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. 

Deuteronomy 31:6

 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. 

Tip 3: Be persistent and consistent in your prayer and keep praying until you have breakthroughs and pray without ceasing, pray when you are mad, sad, happy, relaxed, ect. Pray always!

1 Thessalonians 5:17 

Pray without ceasing. 

God bless everyone who reads this in Jesus mighty name, I hope this helps all of you who read this because these are things I have learned are vital for overcoming the enemy and we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us! Much love and peace be with you all my lovely brothers and sister now go out and bring down strongholds and destroy the works of the enemy!",OrthodoxChristianity

Any protestant converts here?,AstronomerOk4608,1609534812,"I'd love to hear protestant converts' experiences! 

My parents were Catholic and converted into Protestants when they were teens, and so I was born into a Protestant family. They were very anti-Catholic, and they always told me that we must always follow the Bible, not the traditions and heresy that Catholics have created. 

I fell away from the faith while I was in university... long story short, it was only when I reached rock-bottom did I finally decide to rededicate my life to Christ about a month ago. I have started to take my faith very seriously and I started praying and reading my Bible regularly, and just praising God for bringing me back into His arms. While I was away from God, my beliefs wavered so much, and I pretty much only based my morals, values and beliefs in whatever popular culture said. Now that I'm Christian again, I find myself thinking so much about this world, and what drove me to commit my sins, and why the world is just drowning in sins. I also noticed that there is so much division in Protestant churches, and it seemed to me that so many people were just following their own interpretations and trying to justify their sins with God's grace (which I used to do). I was drawn to Catholicism because of the structure, and how the Church is united around the world, the traditions, and the beautiful artwork. 

Some things I have trouble accepting though is the pope's infallibility, the way confession works and the reverence of Mary. I do believe that we should confess our sins, but confessing to a priest is a really hard concept to wrap my head around as it's so foreign to me. 

Now I'm interested in the Orthodox faith because it seems similar to Catholicism, but there is no pope. I also really like how there is weekly fasting, prayer, and saints. I want to have something more tangible in terms of my worship to God, and I want to find more structure in my faith and faith community. It's difficult right now because of COVID, and churches are closed where I live...

Orthodox vs. Protestant Response to Sin &amp; Scandal,AndGrace4Grace,1609512751,"Happy New Year everyone! Former Protestant/soon-to-be-catechumen here. I apologize in advance for being inarticulate!

 I've long perceived a (sometimes) subtle attitude within protestantism of, I guess, futility/apathy? when it comes to striving against sin and actually progressing in holiness. I often get strong relativist vibes when it comes to righteousness as well, as though all sin/all sinners are on exactly the same plane, no one is more holy than the next etc. etc
(Of course there is some basis for this but I hope you guys can understand what I'm driving at here). It just seems a very imbalanced view that emphasizes some teachings in scripture at the expense of others, and I believe it contributes somewhat to the lack of personal holiness as well as the lack of accountability for sin in Protestant circles. 

Now, as some of you may be aware, a prominent Protestant apologist recently passed away, and since then allegations of his sexual misconduct throughout his long ministry have been substantiated. As usual when this happens, there are loads of responses from protestants which all say, essentially, ""so he was a sinner like the rest of us, we shouldn't be shocked, this is why our faith is in Christ and not man, this is why we don't put people on pedestals, etc."" 
And again, while I can understand there is some basis for this, I feel like this type of response is not only dismissive of the gravity of this failure, but plays right into the attitude I described above, where true progress against sin is never really possible in this life so we can't expect/demand better behavior from our leaders and teachers.

I've found what seems to be a much more biblical attitude among the Orthodox toward sin and holiness, what with the teaching of theosis, the acknowledgement of saints, etc. But I guess I'm wondering:
1. If anyone else can relate to this defeatist, even lazy attitude in protestantism, and

2. If in practice the Orthodox responses (in Leadership and laity alike) to egregious moral failings within the Leadership are any more encouraging than what I've seen in protestantism? And no, I don't mean less gracious as that is certainly not what I'm after, but more... exhortation?",OrthodoxChristianity

"What's the move? That is, how should I go about pursuing truth, considering what I know?",Busy-Pear6557,1609383632,"If I truly believed that God would help me, then I would live as if that's all there is to it, and I would leave it at that: I would know that whatever God intends for me is good - sanctification - and I would then submit myself to Him - dedication.

So due to my instability and irregularities, the question becomes: do I believe in God? I think I ask this question because I had sought the answer to a lot of questions before: there are plenty of denominations and religions and philosophies at work in the world, and I must be able to discern why exactly Orthodox Christianity is the correct faith among all of these if I am to believe it.

For the time being, I believe that I'd told myself that I would merely rely on the praxis of Orthodoxy rather than the belief, as I hadn't ascertained the latter, and perhaps, that's where I went wrong and have lead myself to a certain depravity: I am now lacking a foundational reason for my actions, which implies nihilism. There are such people that just wholeheartedly believe, and I'm sure that the fruit of that is in there lives: the fruit may be reflected in one of the Christian saints or someone like Elon Musk or someone like Hitler who strove toward advancement by his own foundational belief. Thus, such people exist in all manner of belief systems, including scientism.

So how can I get myself to believe wholeheartedly when such a grand amount of doubt exists in my heart? **What can I do this very moment?** It cannot merely be waiting toward a future point where I will believe in something truly, right? Is that the right thing to do then? To merely believe?

But beyond that, is it this generation's responsibility now to resolve the convolution of human history? That is, is it our responsibility to figure out who lied and who told the truth? All of human history has certainly lead to this point, and with technology, we have a capacity now to examine our past, although not with absolute accuracy. Hmm, if we don't have absolute accuracy, what do we do? ""Begin."" Is that not the answer? Where others have given up, must we not take strides toward answering the many riddles inside of the minds of others? Here's something I'd written a while back: ""We can all be certain of one thing: any diversion from the truth is harmful; therefore, discussion and persuasion regarding religions. philosophies, and ideologies is a **service**: we speak diplomatically with the other person to explain why the certainty they've come to is incorrect, so that they might be pointed toward what, we believe, is true.""

So instead of relying on polemic or mere rhetoric to sway others' minds, we should be able to point them toward facts - however, isn't that what the scientist supposes that he or she is attempting to do with his or her life? To do everything ""objectively""? The fact is that everyone is just tending toward some future point to discover truth - that we're all just ""moving toward finding the truth,"" but we know that we might never discover it, even if we had an infinite number of time to do so: there will always be more to discover, yes?

Still, chief among all things to remember is that - whether we choose to pursue truth or not - we still all exist in this same reality; therefore, whatever truth we're trying to pursue already exists, and we're living in it.

So what's the move? That is, how should I go about pursuing truth, considering what I know?",OrthodoxChristianity

Showing complete disregard, and then apologizing or repenting seems very shameful and foolish, perhaps more offensive even when it comes to G*D. Of course I expect the shame and manifestation of a punishment when I confront someone with the intention of apologizing. With Jesus or G*D, and this is funny, I feel like He looks down on me and Says: ""What did you expect."" Even more shameful is apologizing then doing it again... Maybe even 3 times. It just seems like I really don't give any effort and disrespecting the afflicted. Mainly my actions towards fellow family members, rage and cussing, coming late to agreed upon things. Me showing rage immediately after apologizing again... It just seems even more offensive and again I look like a foolish man. 
And With G*D... After great sin I struggle to pray, 
meditate, clearing my mind and confronting Him. I hope I made it clear, apologizing and then sinning again seems even more offensive to me. He gives me mercy every time; and also I understand he is still near via The Holy Spirit even if I do not confront him. Simply making great effort not to sin I suppose, especially after apology.

Your prayers have worked!!!,JustaSaintInMaking,1609322989,"At long last, I have made my decision.  I am coming into the Orthodox Church with my children.   Some of you may remember me from a number of back and forth posts where I was struggling with making the decision to become Orthodox.  I'm the canonical Roman Catholic who was trying to become a Ruthenian Catholic as a compromise to remain in communion with my wife, though my heart had already converted to Orthodoxy, and our family was spending all of our time exclusively at an Antiochian Orthodox parish.  Well, ultimately, Eastern Catholicism isn't going to work for me.  I would not be able to make the official switch as the Eastern Bishop, sensibly, requires someone to be attending at said parish for at least 1 year (preferably 2) in order to show the move would be a serious one and not a spur of the moment or rash decision.  While it was certainly reasonable on the part of the bishop, it made it impossible for me to remain Catholic.  So while I am deeply saddened by the thought of breaking communion with the Catholic Church, and far more saddened at the thought of breaking communion with my wife and taking my children out of communion with her, ultimately our souls are more important.  Especially that of my children.  My children (3 and 4) get upset when they see all their friends at church line up to receive Communion and I have to keep telling them they can't yet.  So no more.  I will not keep my children from Christ out of desire for my wife to convert with us when she has made it clear that it won't happen anytime soon, if ever.  So far be it from me to deny our Lord's command to let the children come to Him.  We will be starting the process soon!  I wanted to thank each and every one of you who put up with me and my doubts and struggles over the past few months.  You are all in my prayers and I will forever be grateful to this community here for helping me see the beauty and truth in Orthodoxy.

Question about the council of Chalcedon (specifically canon 28),CountOfLoon,1609246042,"Hello. I was doing some research on the ol' papal supremacy thing when I came across something interesting. I read that, during the council of Chalcedon, the bishops agreed to grant the patriarchate of Constantinople ""equal privileges"" to the See of Rome, along with quite a clear mandate to preside over a bunch of ""eastern"" diocese. 

I also read that the Catholics rejected this cannon, which made me think: ""wait the Catholics rejected (in part) the council of Chalcedon???""

So I made a post about it on the subreddit of our catholic friends and it got a bit of interaction. Some comments contained interesting information, others were just ""Yea but Peter is the rock man"" or ""Yea but this isn't proof that papal supremacy wasn't a thing back then, because the modern pope says it was"", or ""meh the pope is free to dismiss any conclusion at any time by any council because he's the pope""... these answer left me with more questions than answers.

So my question for the fine folks at OrthodoxChristianity is: 

How do the Orthodox view this cannon? Do the orthodox see in this the proof that primacy of a patriarchate does not soley derive from having petrine origin?

I had a few months where I felt very depressed, thinking I committed the unforgivable.

You guys helped me out, and I managed to feel better for a bit, but I started feeling like this again.

At points i where angry, depressed. I felt like maybe it‚Äôs all not true, some things don‚Äôt connect, I don‚Äôt know if to say that at times I might have joked about it.

I started to look into atheist sub Reddit‚Äôs and books, look into what other religions think. At times I felt like just dropping everything, I felt like the pain was so strong that I almost saw atheism as a way to escape.
That if I never had hope, maybe I should stop believing.

Yet I never did. Emotionally, I was bombarded with feelings of hope and hopelessness all at once. I continued to believe and I still do, although sometimes I felt like when I heard somethings about Christianity I didn‚Äôt want to really hear it ( I don‚Äôt k ow how to express my self) mostly because I didn‚Äôt want to get back in a stage of severe depression by interpreting things wrongly.

That‚Äôs not to say that I didn‚Äôt want to get close to God and Jesus. I did. I wanted to learn more, but I have no church close by where I can attend, and again I was emotionally extremely fragile. Considering with all the exams and school work I have coming, going into another depression would destroy me.

All along I keep on praying through out all this time. I tried to stop watching porn, I felt like my heart hasn‚Äôt hardened yet. I keep on believing but it bothers me so much that I had thoughts of stopping to believe and at times I looked at atheism in a way to escape my pain sometimes. I believed but how strong was my faith really?

It bothers me a lot because I believe, and I love God and Jesus Christ and always will. I mean ok, emotionally I was very very fragile and I went through a lot of pain but it still bothers me a lot. Did I go too far to be forgotten?

I don‚Äôt want to say that it‚Äôs my case, but can someone who was a believer, went through a phase of doubt and maybe not even knowing if he‚Äôs believing anymore or not but come back with even stronger faith be forgiven of such thing?

I‚Äôve got a ton of exams coming, and a ton of stress from having to study so much. And right now I‚Äôm just feeling devastated. I feel like my heart hasn‚Äôt hardened yet, and that I shouldn‚Äôt lose hope but my past selfs makes me question if I can be forgiven anymore.

Medications,Demetrios95,1609197482,"Hello all,

I am a baptized Catholic that is heavily leaning towards converting to Orthodoxy. I know this is an ‚Äúask a priest‚Äù question but I have been exposed to COVID and am in isolation.

I was diagnosed with severe OCD 7 years ago. I have been through many medications and am currently prescribed an antidepressant, an anticonvulsant, and a benzodiazepine. The latter drug is considered a narcotic and if I don‚Äôt take it as prescribed, I suffer from withdrawal symptoms that are widely known to be more severe than heroin withdrawal. I am not happy to be on this medication. I have taken it for a few years.

This drug Klonopin is in the same class as Xanax, for perspective. 

Even as I take it as prescribed, I am very far away from what most would see as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and am still somewhat of a nervous wreck. I have motor and vocal tics and with isolation this last year and now after my exposure, things have not improved.

This drug is a sedative. I am wracked with guilt that it sedates me as I feel that I am supposed to suffer. I feel like the drug (as well as the other two) suppresses my suffering and makes me unfit to become Orthodox or receive Communion.

What would the Church think about this? Am I to suffer and be an invalid, or take it and be able to mildly function and do good works? I feel like it falls into the category of drunkenness although I do not abuse it and a physician prescribed it to me...

I don‚Äôt want to be doomed to lose God‚Äôs grace because of this. I fear I‚Äôve been physically and mentally ensnared by a secular tool that the Evil One uses to rip souls away from Christ.

Is it okay to be medicated and be a member of the Church? Aren‚Äôt I supposed to suffer? Have they led me to unknowingly deny the Cross I was meant to bear? 

I know that this may seem scrupulous or zealous but I have no people to turn to on this right now besides the Saints and prayer. Please help me understand the relationship of psychiatric medications within the true Church.

Dogmatic thinking and its roots in the denial of ambiguity,MarysDowry,1609134326,"I originally wrote this for /r/Christianity, but I thought I‚Äôd add to it and make it more relevant to apostolic Christianity. My argument in this thread is quite simple, that dogmatic thinking is an unfortunate and predictable by-product of denying legitimate evidence of ambiguity, and by being overconfident in limited data.

**I would like to suggest anyone who is struggling or new in their faith not to read this post as it will likely not be constructive to you.** 

The major belief that I am espousing here is that its not unambiguously true of self-evidently true that the presuppositions which undergird Christianity in the macro sense are correct, let alone in the micro. 

To properly examine all the areas of ambiguity would take more than a few lifetimes of dedicated research, but I would like to give a brief overview of some major examples.

The reliability of the OT and the gospels as historical witness is the first biggest hurdle that supports the entire faith. The first thing to note is that there is not a clear chain of authorship for the gospels, apart from a few early references in Papias to Mark and Matthew we have no particularly early identification of the documents. What we have that remains of papias is fragmentary and sometimes of debatably reliable provenance. We see that later debates over canon bring up serious doubt of authorship, such as Eusebius‚Äôs belief that the John of revelation was infact Presbyter John and not the apostle John, additionally Eusebius notes that the early Church in his view only accepted 1 Peter as legitimately petrine. Papias‚Äô reference to the ‚Äòlogia‚Äô of Matthew is also widely debated, as it doesn‚Äôt match the document of Matthew we now have.

The synoptic problem is also another parallel issue, as we see that the later gospel authors are largely reliant on material from Mark‚Äôs gospel. There are many instances where later authors disagree with Mark and edit details to give different theological outlooks. We do not see a uniform picture of Christianity across the gospels, an easy example is the issue of food laws. In Mark we get an interjection that Jesus abolished food laws ‚ÄúIn saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean‚Äù, Matthew removes any such indication and instead adds to the end of Jesus‚Äôs statement ‚ÄúThese are what defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him.‚Äù. Later in Acts we see Peter apparently confused over food laws, a strange occurrence given his supposed interpreters clear statements of abolition and Jesus‚Äôs explanation at his request. 

Such disagreements are to be expected when diverse and ideologically varied authors interpret historical events through their individual cultural lenses, this is perfectly acceptable if we act as historians, interpreting the documents in their context and recognising the personal biases and motives, this is a lot more of a problem if we seek to find a universal and consistent binding truth from such documents. 

There are plenty of similar issues that range from minor to quite major. Almost certainly the biggest is the unrivalled uniqueness of John‚Äôs gospel. Whilst the gospels are rather opaque on the true nature of Jesus‚Äô divinity, John (or more likely, the community based around him) gives us sayings of Jesus found nowhere else in scripture which explicitly identify his self-proclaimed divinity. ‚ÄúBefore Abraham was, I am‚Äù, ‚ÄúI and the Father are one‚Äù etc. The divergence of the synoptics and John led some early authors to call John a ‚Äòspiritual gospel‚Äô, Origen remarked that the historical differences within the gospels could not be reconciled. How are we to know the true intentions of Johns gospel, where do we draw the line between theologically infused fiction and literal autobiographical history? We cannot know. 

So far we have 3 synoptic gospels, largely interdependent on each-other, with different theological outlooks and historical details, and a forth gospel which blatantly and irreconcilably diverges from the synoptic traditions in many regards. 

What should also be noted is the time period of the NT texts almost certainly shaped their authorship. Expectations of history are anachronistic when applied to the texts, the wholesale invention of speeches was not an uncommon practice in those ancient times. The widespread use of literary techniques are widespread in the gospels, Matthew for example adds earthquakes to various stories, even changing a storm into an earthquake (leaving behind the winds of the original story). This is also evident in examples of editorial fatigue, where otherwise editorialised details are missed and left unchanged.  Another addition characteristic of Matthews apocalyptic messaging is the raising of the righteous dead of Israel. The absence of what would be such a major prophetic indication is absent from the other gospels and is entirely absent from any historical recording of the time. Did the raising of the dead who then proceeded to walk into Jerusalem actually happen? Did Matthew intend such to be taken literally? We cannot know. 

Can we even know what the original texts said 100%? Take the Marcion gospel of Luke controversy, did Marcion corrupt Luke? Was Luke a redaction of Marcion, were Marcion and Luke both products of a proto-Lucan gospel? Again, there‚Äôs ambiguity. We have variant readings  of various parts of scripture, entirely different endings of Mark for example, we have possible interpolations in various places too. Now to be clear I don‚Äôt think any of the variants call into question major doctrine, but it shows that what constitutes inspired ‚Äòscripture‚Äô is not unambiguous. This is just the new testament, attempting to do similar with the OT is vastly more complex, but we still see traces of contradictory parallel traditions in the text, such as the two creation accounts in Genesis. Again this is not a problem if we take the texts as historical witness to peoples own subjective interpretations of revelation, it is when we try to extract concrete doctrine from it. 

The issue of canon itself is filled with presuppositions. The canon comes from the church, but we would first need to prove that there was a church with this legitimate authority. The historical evidence for the succession of bishops is spotty and sometimes contradictory. Like most ancient history, we simply cannot say anything with certainty. Was Ignatius of Antioch attempting to institute a trend of mono-episcopacy or was he reflecting a normative means of governance? We don‚Äôt know. There‚Äôs some good evidence that some parts of the early church had a collegial system of governance for example, how did this progress to monarchical model (if the collegial model in-fact existed at all), we can‚Äôt know for sure. What books are even canon? Even within the Orthodox church the canon traditions are varied. In early Christianity we seem to see far more leniency and a wider use of what would now be considered non-canonical books, Enoch being a prime example, quoted in Jude. The question of who even has authority is also not simple, even those later deemed heretics claimed apostolic origin, the claim of apostolic origin was not unique to those proto-Orthodox figures. Its not self-evidently true which side we should trust, and given the fact that the Orthodox unsurprisingly didn‚Äôt copy the vast array of heretical texts we simply do not have a uniform view of the matter, what we largely have is hostile witness to lost texts and vague indications of early debates and controversies. 

Other than by an extrapolation of a single event in Acts (once again, a matter of debatable historicity) we have no substantial evidence that the church councils are authoritative, and even if we were to totally accept Acts and the extrapolations drawn from it, the claims of what exactly makes a council authoritative and the exact status of doctrine is highly contestable and uncertain. These claims to power themselves rest on the gospels, Matthew is the only one who witnesses to the specific authorisations of the church, not even Mark (Peter‚Äôs interpret by tradition) records Peter‚Äôs supposed founding role and proclamation of faith. The history of the vast majority of the apostles is highly speculative, really the only major sources we have are Paul‚Äôs letters, Acts and the gospels, and potentially epistles like James. which only really focus on Jerusalem and Paul. 

And to not leave this unstated, the entire truthfulness of all the above, even ignoring all the challenges, is reliant on a single event. The resurrection of Christ. As much as we can try to argue for such an event, it cannot be proven by historical method and there is as of yet no unambiguous proof of this events historicity. My point so far is that what we often see as self-evidently true is based on a series of highly contestable claims, much like a house of cards. 

In addition to all of this, continued rejection of legitimate ambiguity often requires special pleading. The most obvious example of this is the case of the miraculous in other faiths (or even just other denominations) and other peoples claims of religious experience with God. The common retort is either to outright deny that the other faiths (or even other churches) have any kind of grace, to just ignore these occurrences or to claim that they are true, but just demonic. What should be quite obvious to anyone thinking, is that these claims are mostly just apologetic reactions based on no real evidence. How do you know that the supposed visions of Orthodox saints are true and the contradictory Catholic visions are not? Well, because you presuppose Orthodoxy is true. Orthodox like to claim the unique guidance of the spirit, but even our own saints do not experience the same God. You‚Äôd find it very difficult, essentially impossible, to reconcile the experience of God from someone like St Isaac or St Gregory of Nyssa with any of the various infernalists. Given such the wide disparity in experience, why would I set myself up in opposition to others based on the ‚Äòinspired‚Äô opinions of the Fathers? The fact that the Fathers can come to such varying and often contradictory claims on just about every passage and issue (and before the canon, on even what was useful to read) should show that there is likely not a single divine source of doctrinal knowledge that is being zapped into their heads as some expression of the ‚Äòtrue faith‚Äô. My point here is that admitting ambiguity is the honest reaction to the observable phenomenon, but so many Orthodox cling to strict notions of patristic inspiration in spite of this, attacking others in the faith because they disagree on doctrine or the teaching of the Fathers. 

The history of the church often shows the bad fruits of this kind of denial of ambiguity, from the relatively minor squabbling all the way to torture and exile. I fail to see how the sheer level of hostility and exclusivism is a real fruit of the spirit of the God who commended the faith of the Samaritan heretic or who told his apostles to let others continue casting out demons in peace, apart from the apostles. The way many Orthodox act, you‚Äôd think Christ‚Äôs proclaimed the necessity of assenting to the Nicean creed during the sermon of the mount, instead of his teaching that we‚Äôd be judged based on how we treated others. The denial of real ambiguity leads to continued struggle over doctrinal minutiae (which to be quite frank, is never specified as a necessary condition for salvation) instead of loving acceptance of all people. The opposition to ecumenism stems from mythology and the denial of ambiguity.

The faith started out with Jews who would go into the temple and the synagogue to preach to those who did not even believe in Christ, nowadays we find it sinful to even attend the services of those who affirm the same creed and Lord as us (the Catholics). I see this kind of thinking too often as an outlet for pride and quasi-nationalism. Instead of supporting a country or a sports team or a political party, we support a church. When we talk of the Catholics we are quick to point out that they need to bow down to our demands because we have the ‚Äòtrue faith‚Äô, we‚Äôll even push aside the Orientals who differ from us in such minor ways that its almost indistinguishable to most people. The denial of ambiguity leads us to favouring doctrinal minutiae over communion with our fellow Christians, can this be a real fruit of the Spirit? And sometimes it wasn‚Äôt even over doctrine itself, but over the practical aspects of worship, we saw conflict over the style of tonsure, over leavened or unleavened bread, over the day of celebrations, over calenders. I really fail to see how any of these can be seen as meaningful, other than by denying that there is real ambiguity (are you fed up of me saying that yet?), so much controversy rests on the implicit assumption that there was a pre-existent and formalised true faith which was then consciously eroded by deranged heretics, when this is not obviously the case. This is how we get to people like St Sophronius viciously insulting Origen in his synodal letter, because Origen supposedly was an evil God hating heretic who just wanted to destroy the faith because he was impious or some such nonsense. We get saints proclaiming that heretics cannot be saved even by martyrdom or that there is no salvation outside the church (even if w e now take a far looser reading of that phrase). Instead of accepting the obvious reality that most early writers inhabited an environment of huge doctrinal variance, most historians and biblical scholars readily acknowledge the vast variety of acceptable early Christian practice, but pious myth and continued centralisation of power turned that reality into violence. Too often we act as if the heretics were just denying the plainly obvious out of hatred and evil intent, instead of having legitimate disagreements based on the fact that nothing was particularly clear-cut or certain. Is the scorning of heretics (and even those who died in the company of the church) for 2000 years in keeping with Christ‚Äôs message of forgiveness? 

If you actually read all this I am surprised, but I hope you see what I am trying to get at here. We would all do well to accept that the things we‚Äôve convinced ourselves of aren‚Äôt self-evidently true and to remember that those who disagree aren‚Äôt always disagreeing because they are stupid or because they have a spirit of hatred against us, but perhaps its because they have a legitimate point of view too. I don‚Äôt miss the slight irony of being convinced of my own beliefs and seeing them as obviously true, but hopefully I take my own advice and do not divide the body based on such debates. To be clear I am not attempting to destroy anyone's faith in Christ here or the church, believe as you wish, my point is that our subjective interpretations of history should never come before love and acceptance of another, regardless of how firmly we think these things are true.",OrthodoxChristianity

I have a question about how to handle one person in the church I go to who seem to be against me converting to orthodoxy.

I am a catechumen and I am supposed to be christmated soon. My priest and I have been talking about deciding on a date, so with that in mind he must think I am ready. And I feel ready as well, I have been wanting this for over a year (but I have not been a catchumen for a year).

However, there is one person at this church who keeps telling me to wait longer, and keeps hinting that I shouldn't do it. He barely knows me, he has talked to me twice. First time he said it out loud, then the other time he apologized for what he said and that it was wrong of him because he doesn't know me; then later that same day still said it again. I know that ultimately it isn't up to him, but I'd be lying if I said it does not bother me. I am asking for advice on how to handle this and I'm also wondering if this is common.

I have been feeling that this is right in my heart for a very long time, but this is making me feel a bit anxious. It doesn't change my mind on converting, but it gives me some sort of negative feeling, not sure how to explain it better than it is an anxious feeling.",OrthodoxChristianity

Why Anti-Maskers Should Wear Mask,ProfCChristian,1609040279,"I do not particularly care about the mask vs. no-mask debate. I always wear a mask, but find that there are annoying people on both sides of the debate.   


However, I implore anti-maskers -- particularly among clergy -- to continue wearing masks and to enforce physical distancing.   


The reason is simple: evangelism and optics.   


 I've been attending an Orthodox parish here, whose priests are lackadaisical about masks and physical distancing. My family, which was considering converting to Orthodoxy, was annoyed about this flouting of public health guidelines and the bishop's orders. They do not wish to convert to Orthodoxy anymore, thinking that we're a bunch of Luddites.   


This breaks my heart tremendously.  


So please, don't give a reason for people to reject Orthodoxy. The Bible tells us to obey the civil authorities, unless they orders contradict Church dogma. We can disagree among ourselves about masks, distancing, etc., and we should push back when unfair lockdowns are imposed on us, but let's not be bad examples to people.",OrthodoxChristianity

I want to become Orthodox but my local parishes are ethnic clubs,Chrysogonus,1608939374,"I am Anglican at the moment, but read Ware‚Äôs The Orthodox Church a few years ago, and found it very intellectually satisfying. For a year, I had the chance to attend an Orthodox Church of America parish that was absolutely marvellous. (Even as a small mission parish, it ran five times as many services as most churches that have ten times their resources, and did so with incredible but simple beauty.) Orthodox doctrine and worship provides many things that have been missing from my life ‚Äì in fact, on investigation, that were once part of western churches but that we‚Äôve since lost. This is the Christianity that I want to grow in and pass on. 

But there‚Äôs a problem: last year I moved to a city in which Orthodox churches are a force for perpetuating Eastern European customs rather than Christianity per se. There are three Orthodox parishes of different nationalities, and they all seem to despise each other: one is Russian, another is Julian-calendar Russian (they split from the former a little over a decade ago), and the third a Slavic minority. I tried attending them all several times, but even before the pandemic, nobody would even acknowledge my presence. The last actively drives people away of other nationalities, without so much as an English translation of their website.

This is in an area in which there are very few people of these ethnic groups, and they probably feel besieged. But this is a major city, and one would think that evangelizing it would be more important than cultural purity.

The only Orthodox person I‚Äôve met in the year since I moved here now attends a Baptist church, as he considers it to be the least heretical local faith group where he could find a community. (There are local Anglican and Roman Catholic churches, but they‚Äôre all given up on anything identifiable with historical Christianity. The priest at the closest parish to where I live denies the Virgin Birth.)

Since the pandemic, it‚Äôs all been about watching filmed worship from back home, while local parishes have become completely closed to outsiders. My drive to have anything to do with church is slowly dying, along with them. I can read and sing some random prayers in my room, but it increasingly feels like a weird obsession that nobody else bothers with. There are many days on which I feel like I‚Äôm the crazy one for still caring about any of this, and wonder if my time would be better spent volunteering for a food bank on Sunday mornings. We now have a tiny child and worry that he will never have an experience of growing up in a local church.

Now, years later, and as I said, I haven‚Äôt said any ‚Äúroutine‚Äù prayers in a long time, and I have avoided spiritual readings of any kind because every time I‚Äôve done it in the past, I‚Äôve drawn more and more into a radical traditionalist standpoint.

Why should we be good if we cannot earn our way into heaven?,throwaway-aa2,1608856828,"Couple of notes:

* About 3 weeks ago I opened my heart to Christianity, and have been trying to learn. Ordered 2 bibles, started officially reading the Bible and praying, and just soaking up all the info I can.
* I know the most about Eastern Orthodox, and I'll be attending liturgy (already talked with a father) but I'm in the middle of moving so I'll have to wait for a real world interaction.
* I really don't want to ask this in the normal christianity sub, I really only trust you all to answer it and give good feedback on it, as I know the view on this from Eastern Orthodox differs from Protestantism and all of those.

I know and understand that we can't merely earn our way into heaven just purely on our good deeds, but by our faith.

The problem I've had with Christianity ""forever"" (and why I refused to believe) is the Christians surrounding me (society, mother, father) who use Christianity and faith to shield them from being criticized and allow them to act however nasty they want to others (because they're going to heaven because they have faith), and to give them ammo for telling people they're going to hell and such so that they can feel superior to others. That's my little vent but hopefully that gives you a frame of reference.

I keep hearing that you cannot earn your way into heaven by your actions, but only by your faith. The thing I'm having a hard time reconciling, is that I have to assume that having faith in Jesus but choosing not to repent, continuing to have pre martial sex, killing, not praying, etc, doesn't just mean you get into heaven because you believe he died for your sins.

That sort of contradicts with the idea of not being able to earn you way into heaven by your good deeds. Now I understand you can't merely get into heaven just by good deeds, but assuming you have good faith, I have to assume and believe that the person who prays every day, goes to church every week / two weeks, reads the Bible, and acts within the framework that god sets... I have to assume that this person would be in better standing with god.

If this ""isn't"" the case, then what would the logic be behind not committing sin? What I mean is, is if I do EVERYTHING right, but I commit adultery by lusting over another women I see in public, I could say to myself that it's ok to do a little sin because god will forgive me for it.

I'm not looking for an excuse or anything and I would appreciate a non antagonistic answer (If I asked this question in the christianity sub they would just tell me I'm going to hell or looking for justification to sin...

Can God help me with depression and existential anxiety?,Kozchey,1608851353,"I mean depression and anxiety in their medical meanings.   


I am taking meds prescribed by a psychiatrist and a friend recommended me a psychotherapist who saved her from suicide. So, yes, I know God is not a substitute for whtavever has to be done.  


I am male, recently 31. In theory I have big career change plans and in theory I want to have a family on my own, i.e. have a meaningful life. Truth is, I really don;t know what I want from mlife and **don't know why I am living right now** even in my normal or happy times.  


Three weeks ago my old depression and anxiety due to obsessive fear of the death of my loved ones came back. I thought I had beaten in for good two years ago.  


I have struggled from intrusive and obsessive thoughts since I was 12. I believe they fuel my anxiety which causes depression. My father was physically abusive towards my mother and her mother (my grandmother). I am pretty sure childhood trauma is in the root of my mental problems.

I also definitely struggle from personal deficites as I grew up without a father figure - even at this age I fail to be polite and respectful with my mother. I can get extremely vengful if a girl cheats on me.

I also lack spirituality - in the secular meaning and in terms of faith. I know many people seek God when life gets hard. I am somewhere between deist and agnostic or even atheist. I would like to believe in a loving God who hears our prayer and loves us as his children - you know, the universal deist thing, that most people nowadays tend to lean to. I would like to be a believer but I just don't feel I do. Yet. I say a quick honest prayer when I visit church as a tourist - I mean I have been thinking of God even in my good times.  


I am not an egoist, but an extremely egocentrict person. Given this, plus how I communicate with my mother, etc. - I need to grow not only in terms of mental health, but as a person. I am still immature in a certain way.  


Do you think God can help me with the pain that my anxiety causes to me. I have been praying a little to him, asking him to show me the way out of this suffering and how to live as per his will. I know you will say yes, but last time it was three hard and sometimes dark years in depression. And then some more, and more - so many times after I was 11,12 - there was always some issue with my head. Not always dark and depressive moment, but sometime it was. And now I want to put and end to it. He didn't help me for so long years and now I am afraid I will not have fruiftul 30s. And while having meaningful and fruitful life is a must, why not be happy from time to time.  


I need the psychotherapy. Maybe God will help me through it. But would He show me some how He exists and cares for my pain. He is my witness I want to lead a life that He approves. I feel like a child who needs his mother or father to hug him and guide him. I secretly hope this ""hug"" could come from Him. From God.  


Has God ever showed you a way to go? You know what hardline non-believers would say, right? That you guys just adjust whatever happens in your life and say ""right here! That was a sign from God"" I am a non-believer who would like to find Faith. What is even worse than being a non-believer is that I am a huge nihilist and I hate it - I really don't feel my life was meant for something.",OrthodoxChristianity

Titles are hard haha.

I have never been religious previously in my life, I was never a part of a church or congregation. My father passed a couple years back when I was 21 and as the months passed I felt a push towards discovering more about religion and became someone who never believed in Gods existence to now currently being confident in myself to learn and expand in his teachings.

I spent a couple of weeks exploring the different Faiths / Sects of Christianity. My partner is Protestant from a Catholic family. After discussing both with her and researching I felt a pull towards the ancient rituals and pure continuity of Orthodoxy. 

I live in England. I have made contact with a few Greek Orthodox churches but they have responded by saying they only do services in Greek.

I made contact with a particular church today that has the Divine Liturgy on Sundays but also carry out Holy Communion in English on Saturday (I noticed the Communion was at least two hours shorter than the Greek liturgy). I explained my situation and asked if I attend the English Communion to learn more and join in worship would I be missing out of teachings (potentially 2 hours worth) that the Greek would give.

They responded by giving me the number for the Archdiocese of Britain and Ireland and said that calling them on Monday they might have links to English Zoom classes that someone like me would benefit from.

My question is, firstly, would the Archdiocese office(?) have this kind of thing, secondly, it seems that the ability to call up such an important organisation of the church and ask for help as someone not from a church, seems, entitled? Or have they maybe redirected me as a kind way or saying ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt really help you‚Äù?

If this is something the Archdiocese would help with, is there a certain route I should ask on the phone to be directed to the best sources?

I apologise if this comes across rude, I promise I don‚Äôt mean it. I‚Äôm a nervous person usually and I don‚Äôt want to call up and waste the time of the Archdioceses if it‚Äôs in vain.

1. Rural (usually Southern) Protestants who are in folk religion



2. African Americans




3. Muslims





My questions are basically firstly, do you feel besides being a more biblical and historical faith, that there is anything in particular that Orthodoxy offers that speaks to these groups better Protestantism or Islam in general (for example, a greater connection to the martyrs and the downcast for African Americans and a greater relation to orthopraxy and worship for Muslims than Protestantism can offer) and secondly are there any books specifically that offer apologetic sources for Islam in particular?

Why we celebrate Christmas on December 25,herman-the-vermin,1608690281," 

Why do the Christians celebrate Christmas on December 25?

Christ was born that day. 

Saint Telesphorus the Pope ruling from 126 to 137 instituted a midnight Divine Liturgy on the eve of Nativity going into Christmas day. 

Saint Theophilus (+181): ‚ÄúWe ought to celebrate the birthday of Our Lord on what day soever the 25th of December shall happen.‚Äù

Saint Hippolytus (+240), ""The First Advent of our Lord in the flesh occurred when He was born in Bethlehem, was December 25th, a Wednesday, while Augustus was in his forty-second year, which is five thousand and five hundred years from Adam. He suffered in the thirty-third year, March 25th, Friday, the eighteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, while Rufus and Roubellion were Consuls.""

Saint Augustine (+430): ""For Christ is believed to have been conceived on the 25th of March, upon which day also he suffered; so the womb of the Virgin, in which he was conceived, where no one of mortals was begotten, corresponds to the new grave in which he was buried, wherein was never man laid, neither before him nor since. But he was born, according to tradition, upon December the 25th.""

December 25th was always the day celebrated in the European West whereas in several places in the East it was celebrated in conjunction with Christ's baptism in the Jordan all on one day: January 6th. Saint Gregory Nazianzen tells us how both Christ's birthday and baptism are both called Theophany since they both reveal God to man in their own ways. Our Lady, the Virgin Mary, was known to have conceived Christ at the Annunciation on March 25th, and as the sinless and perfect One, He was born without birth pangs nine months later on December 25th. 

By Saints Basil and Chrysostom's time, the East was adopting the December 25th date due to the historical data they found thanks in part to the Roman census that was taken at Christ's birth. Rome had the records and so we now all as one worship the God Who became a Child from a Virgin Mother ""born in a cave for our salvation.""",OrthodoxChristianity

So I found a center (the Washington Center) and got accepted. Moreover, I also saw this as a chance to be free. So I jumped at the chance, then COVID happened though and it got moved. And it got moved again. Finally setting on leaving this January. 

Downside is the sites reach out to you for an internship and it seems as if all I‚Äôve been getting is rejection. I know it‚Äôs stupid, but if this doesn‚Äôt work out I know I‚Äôll regret it for the rest of my life. I pray to Our Lord, but it seems like he‚Äôs not listening. I know He‚Äôs trying to help me but the problem with free will is that although I may follow His signs that‚Äôs not universally shared. It‚Äôs just last time when I had a family member hurt and I asked for prayers it worked. And to be honest, I‚Äôm kinda running out of hope so I‚Äôm asking for the same. I want to help save the world as stupid as it sounds. But I can‚Äôt save it if I end up in small town USA",OrthodoxChristianity

*In the crisis moments of history, in search of answers to the challenges of time, there is often a desire to imagine how certain historical heroes would have acted in the current situation. In the current coronavirus year 2020, many new problems have arisen for the Church, how to serve, how to receive communion, how to protect themselves from the virus. In the Memorial Apartment of St.John of Kronstadt has to hear different opinions of pilgrims that father John would never have received communion with plastic single spoons, would not have dipped a spoon in alcohol. Others say that the priest was not a formalist and for him the external side was not important, he did not always observe it, for example, he conducted a General confession or frequent communion.*

*To adequately answer this question, you need to find a similar situation in the life of an ascetic and see how he behaved in it.*

Godparent when converting and their role,ne0ngl0w,1608570374,"Hello.
I'm wondering what the role of the godparent is when it is an adult converting. As I understand it, when parents pick a godparent for their child their role is to speak for the child when it gets baptized, and also make sure that if the parents pass away the child will still continue going to church and learn about the orthodox way of life.
When the person getting baptized is already an adult, they can technically speak for themselves but one still gets a godparent. Is this simply to follow traditions?

What is the difference between the God parent and spiritual father? Because it seems like when an adult convert they turn to the godparent when they have questions about the faith as well, but many say they ask they spiritual fathers etc. About these things. Are they synonymous?

"New Christian believer, recently introduced to Orthodoxy, I'm at least 3 hours (one way) away from one.",throwaway-aa2,1608525814,"When I say new believer, I mean I've never fully read the Bible, haven't been to church in years since I was a kid, etc.

I'm getting ready to be a first time home owner, one reason being that I want to be away from all of these big metropolitan non believer cities when the presidential inauguration rolls around (there are plenty of other reasons). I've found a really really nice place in the country.

I had some great person suggest Eastern Orthodox to me. It seems great from what I can tell, and addresses some issues I considered were ""christian"" things but it now seems they were more denominational in nature.

So I've never been to any church in a while, let alone a liturgy. I'm moving in less than 3 weeks. I still ""do"" have time to cancel the place but it is unlikely that I will find as nice of a place, within my budget, and it'll leave me living where I live now, in an expensive, dangerous, godless place.

The problem is that I only just recently got introduced to Orthodox. To my discouragement, when looking online, the closest places to my new home are 3 hours away, ONE WAY. 1 hour there and back would be one thing... but a 6 hour round trip? It would take a lot of excess money and gas pollution to even get there, and I'm going to have a farm (if I'm away too far and too long, predators could get to them, or people could kill / steal livestock).

It seems like the basis of this denomination is REALLY going to liturgy and experience things in the flesh, and also taking the journey with others.

So yeah this seems like a lot to commit to, especially when I haven't been to service once. Not getting that place also seems incredibly excessive (I searched for many many hours to find that place, and I'd like to be moved in by January, and I've done all the house inspections and committed to buying the place).

My orthodox friend told me I should attend service at another local church especially not having attended churches in a while but it's obvious to me that it's not the same?

I'm just sort of confused what I should be doing really. It seems like I'm not so blessed based on the location of the house I picked, and changing gears would force me to find a new house based on a denomination of a church that I have never visited before.

I'm getting ready for confession soon, and i realized I should probably talk to him about me being bisexual but since he's not really my spiritual father, it feels weird talking about it, especially since my family doesn't know (I'm a minor) and the area where my church is homophobic. For the first thing, i know that i should confess that but it's hard for me to tell him since it seems like I've been telling him the same thing since i first started confession.

Suggestions for Catholic Possibly Inquiring,thomas_basic,1608505417,"My request for suggestions is not logistical--meaning I am not looking for Orthodox temple locations or book suggestions--but rather more psychological, for lack of better word. I have a number of mental and personal barriers which prevent me.  


For about 10 years I (as a Roman Catholic) have been off-and-on reading about and contemplating the position of the Orthodox Church. I am wondering about inquiring 'officially' but have reservations and I'm wondering if anyone might have advice or has been in this position. These reservations are in no particular order of importance.  


Reservation 1. Ethnically I am Irish, German, French Canadian, and a number of other ethnicities of Northern Europe. My family is culturally Catholic, but currently our grandparents and myself are the only ones who practice. I treasure my membership in the Catholic Church because it connects me to my grandparents (some who have passed) and forms part of my identity as an Irish (and other ethnic groups) American. This may be read as placing nationality above Christ. I'm not sure if I can explain that articulately. I feel if I leave the Roman Church I am betraying my ancestors who stood for their beliefs.

Reservation 2. I am a gay man married to a man. I'm not sure what more should be said. I understand the Orthodox Church's teaching on this. I'm not sure if a priest would suggest we divorce, or something to this effect, and I'm nervous about other issues that might arise from this such as end of life issues-- ie. the Orthodox Church refusing to perform a funeral for me or bar him from attending or vice versa. Overall, I am nervous the Orthodox Church's pastoral approach to my situation.

Reservation 3. My family and myself have a strong devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe who has worked miracles for our family.

Quotes: 

‚ÄúLove the poor and co-suffer with them, so that God may have mercy on you also.
Do not rebuke those who sorrow at heart, that you might not be punished with the same rod, and so that when you begin to seek for one that would have mercy on you, you might not find that there he is not there!‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember that you also bear a mortal body, and do good to all without exception.‚Äù

‚ÄúDiscernment is higher than all other virtues.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo not reproach anyone for their sins, but consider yourself responsible for everything, even for your neighbor‚Äôs sins.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is better to be despised than to despise. It is better to be insulted than to insult another.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo not live with a proud person, so that your soul would not lose the grace of the Holy Spirit and thus become the habitation of evil passions.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe who flees the vain glory of this world feels the glory of the future life in his soul.‚Äù

‚ÄúHate repose and a comfortable existence, so that you might preserve your thoughts in tranquility.‚Äù

‚ÄúAvoid meeting excessively with others and take care for your own soul, so that you might preserve peace of soul.‚Äù

‚ÄúAvoid small sins, so that you might not fall into greater ones.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is more profitable to resurrect your soul from the passions, contemplating the Divine, than it is to raise the dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúMany have done amazing deeds, raised the dead, and labored in asceticism; in order to bring the lost to the path of salvation they worked great miracles. Many have been brought to God through their efforts. Later, however, those who raised the dead have fallen into shameful passions. By their sinful deeds, which became known, they have led many into temptation. In reality they themselves were sick, but instead of caring for their own spiritual health, they threw themselves into the open sea of this world in order to heal and save the souls of others, thereby ruining both their hope and their souls.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoever hates the seduction and distraction of the mind that comes in worldly affairs will see his Master and Lord within his heart.‚Äù

‚Äú Our only weapons are spiritual ones: prayer, humility, love, but also confession [of faith]. You can‚Äôt love without confession [of faith]. Love is sacrificial, and if we fear to confess the truth, what sacrifice do we have? Or if we do not care about our neighbor who is unaware and we do not inform him and we let him fall prey to this system, what love do we have?

Those who still struggle today to awaken their brother, who have not remained indifferent to the future of a nation and a church, those are the children of the love of God, who lay their lives down for their brethren...

It is important to oppose all antichrists and die with dignity; not to have a cowardly position...‚Äù

‚ÄúSo that the Lord might pay attention to our virtues, they must be accompanied by physical temperance and a pure conscience.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is better to live with eagles than with the greedy and insatiable.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is better to live with a crippled and outcast person than with a proud one.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is better to be persecuted than to persecute; it is better to be crucified than to crucify; it is better to be insulted than to insult; it is better to be slandered than to slander.‚Äù

‚ÄúSelf-justification has no place in the life of a Christian, and can be found nowhere in Christ‚Äôs teachings.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you love meekness, you will see peace within your soul. And if you become worthy to acquire peace, you will rejoice in any trial.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod forebears all our infirmities, but He cannot bear one who murmurs all the time, and He punishes him in order to correct him.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lips and the heart that give thanks to God in any trial or temptation receive His blessing and Divine grace.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod‚Äôs grace is preceded by humility of wisdom, but God‚Äôs punishment is preceded by high-mindedness.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen your life is according to God, do not be saddened over afflictions and your ferocious passions, for God will take them from you one fine day. Neither fear death, because God has prepared future goodness in order to make you higher than death. ‚Äú

**Speaking of Orthodoxy, we should not repeat Pilate's mistake when he asked Christ, ""What is truth?""** **(John 18, 38).** **The correct thing is: ""They are the truth"".**

 

For truth is not an idea, a theory, a system, but a person the Holy Person of the Incarnate Word of God, Jesus Christ. So we must ask about Orthodoxy, because it is identified with the theo-human Face of God the Word. He, as a Godman, is our Orthodoxy, our Pan-Truth.

 

1. If we wanted to conventionally define Christianity as Orthodoxy, we would say that it is the experience of the presence of the Uncreated (God) 1 in history and the possibility of the created (man) to become God ""by grace"". Given the perpetual presence of God in Christ in historical reality, Christianity offers man the possibility of deification, as Medical Science enables him to maintain or restore his health, but in both cases through a certain healing process and a specific lifestyle.

Holy Trinity,ice-ice_baby,1608437001,"I never bothered to understand Trinity as I felt Holy Spirit years ago and I was sure I‚Äôm on the right path. However my human brain tried to imagine this God that is at the same time One, but also three persons. When we say three distinct persons we associate this word with humans like us and I just imagine three men (that‚Äôs why I prefer the word entity). And when I saw an icon (I think Oriental) of three men who look the same and represent Trinity I was very confused. I love that we have icons of Mary and our Saints as they existed as people and also icons of Jesus are fine because we have an idea how he looked when he was on Earth. But I thought we shouldn‚Äôt depict Father? I saw an icon that has Father above Mary and Jesus. And spirit of God - Holy Spirit is depicted as dove in icons? That is just symbolic I know, but I kinda understand the Protestant argument against images of God. Anyway I want to check if I understand our theology first. Jhon 1:1 - In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. This is about Jesus, he‚Äôs the word of God that became flesh. We gave these three entities titles Father, Son and Spirit based on scripture.

Holy Trinity,ice-ice_baby,1608436336,"I never bothered to understand Trinity as I felt Holy Spirit years ago and I was sure I‚Äôm on the right path. However my human brain tried to imagine this God that is supposedly one, but is three persons sitting at throne. When we say three distinct persons we associate this word with human people like us and I just imagine three men at Heaven (that‚Äôs why I prefer the word entity). And when I saw an icon (I think Oriental) of three men who look the same and represent Trinity I was very confused. I love that we have icons of Mary and our Saints as they existed as people and also icons of Jesus are fine because we have an idea how he looked when he was on Earth. But I thought we shouldn‚Äôt depict Father? I saw an icon that has Father above Mary and Jesus. And spirit of God - Holy Spirit is depicted as dove in icons? That is just symbolic I know, but I kinda understand the Protestant argument against images of God. Anyway I want to check if I understand our theology. Jhon 1:1 - In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. This is about Jesus, he‚Äôs the word of God that became flesh. We gave these three entities titles Father, Son and Spirit based on scripture and because Mary conceived through Holy Spirit and Jesus is Son of God in that way because he was born  and Mary is therefor Theotokos.

He asked why I pray for Mary to pray for me, and said that no one is in heaven yet, and I didn't quite know a scripture at hand to argue this

In addition to the idea of proof of God in itself, I'm also curious about how you all feel about the impact of philosophy on faith.

How can I find God?,Kozchey,1608384578,"I am Orthodox Christian and identify culturally as such. I am not a believer, unfortunately. Not really an atheist, probably agnostic. When it comes to God and the Devine I don't go with reasoning, I just check how I feel things are. My feeling/assumption is that there might be some sort of Deity ruling this world, but it is some Force behind the whole matrix. I really don't feel this force cares about our prayers or loves us, it is just a Force and is indifferent to us.  


Often people seek God when in huge dispair. I am not in one currently, but recently I started struggling with anxiety again, something that I thought I had beaten for good 2 years ago, I won't lie - the thought of God appeared in my mind again. Believers find salvation and reason to live through their Faith - and this is, excue me for marking it, but it is appealing. Nevertheless, I have often thought on these matters when in good state as well.  


The above was about God in general, in terms of deism. When it comes strictly to Christianity I don't think I will ever qualify for a true believing Christian - I view Jesus as a human being who changed history, not as a Son of God; I don't believe in the his miracle or resurection nor in the Immaculate Conception. Knowing myself I don't think those will ever change. I am not a hardline rationalist, don't deny what appears to be supernatural, etc., just my mind can't accept any form of miracles and will probably never accept them.

I have an ""understanding"" for the more abstract concepts like Logos, I am drawn towards the most ascetic aspects of orthodoxy like nepsis/hesychasm, I ""understand"" the logic behind fasting and abstinence and praying to the saints. I have deep respect and admiration for gerondas, I like reading theological texts of St. Justin Popovich. I feel that there's one ultimate Aletheia of the world and we can be part of it as long as we manage to free ourselves from the conditioning and the worldly fallacy. I often contemplate and feel sad about this lack of freedom and about how my ontological state keeps me trapped and won't allow me to think clearly.

I think I am drawn towards these ideas because of my love for Greek language, Plato and Heraclitus. I also like to engage the concept of Mnemosyne to my thinking.

Some questions about domestic abuse within the Church,moshpitjoe1,1608377986,"I am a catechumen, and I generally feel as if the Orthodox Church is the true Church, but one thing that has deeply troubled me recently is the lack of response of some within the Church to domestic violence. We have priests like Fr. Josiah Trenham saying the following:

""This wifely obedience and powerful virtue is especially tested and demonstrated when the husband tempts the wife by his own arrogance, by his pride, or by a tyrannical spirit, or sometimes by his own irresponsibility or even radical incompetence which might even threaten the safety of the family, or the well-being of the family in various ways. We men can do all of these things fairly easily. It‚Äôs at times like that when the good wife manifests her character by refusing to act in the face of her husband‚Äôs craziness, by refusing to act as her husband‚Äôs head, or as his teacher and judge. The good wife does not fight with her husband, she does not raise her voice against him, as though she is his head, or as though they‚Äôre co-heads. There are no co-heads. To do so is a sure and certain and certain way to cause the husband to react even worse, and to disdain whatever of importance the wife may be attempting to communicate to him.""

(from ""The Good Wife"" episode 1)

This sort of statement suggests, to me, that a wife should not speak out about verbal and physical abuse from her husband in the name of maintaining 'order' and headship. Do any of you know Trenham personally? What does he say a woman should do in the face of abuse? How does the Church generally deal with verbal and physical abuse within marriage?",OrthodoxChristianity

Question regarding books on St. Silouan the Athonite,LuapOivasLamrin,1608354172,"Hello, all!

I'm a Catholic who has a deep interest in Orthodox spirituality. I would be very grateful if someone here could clarify a point.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is:

Is this book ([Saint Silouan the Athonite](https://www.amazon.com/Silouan-Athonite-Archimandrite-Sophrony-1999-02-03/dp/B01FEK6NK6/)) just a combination of the content in these other two smaller  books ([The Monk of Mt. Athos](https://www.amazon.com/Monk-Mount-Athos-Staretz-1866-1938/dp/091383615X/) / [Wisdom from Mt. Athos](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Mount-Athos-Writings-1866-1938/dp/0913836176/)) or does it have completely different content ? 

&amp;#x200B;

All are authored by St. Sophrony and have the same translator. But the two smaller books seem to have roughly less than half the page count of the bigger book, which is why I thought that perhaps the bigger book is a combination of the two smaller books. But what confuses me a bit is that the year of publication (based on Amazon information) of the bigger book (1999) is between those of the two smaller books. (1997 &amp; 2001)

&amp;#x200B;

I have already purchased ""Saint Silouan the Athonite"" and am currently reading it. I was just wondering if I would get the benefit of learning anything new on the life &amp; teachings of St. Silouan by purchasing the other two books next.

"Questions regarding fasting: discernment, spiritual father, and church tradition.",Brawnyson,1608336365,"Hello, brothers and sisters in Christ. I am an inquirer into the faith and am trying to grow closer to God through fasting, as well as practice obedience to the church that I may eventually join, and to unite myself in the ancient tradition of the church fathers. That being said, I have a few questions. 

Is breaking the fast sinful? Also, in what way are we to fast if we fail in keeping with church tradition? Say, I fail to abstain from dairy product. Is it best to keep the spirit of the law and fast in a way that I am able to discern as being healthy? If I fail in one area, is it permissible to fast from something else while still attempting to follow the guidelines of the church?

I do not have a spiritual father; therefore, should I take this to God in prayer and do my best to please Him? 

I ask these questions for two reasons mainly: because I do not want to be prideful in ‚Äúchoosing‚Äù what I fast from and what I do not fast from, and the second reason being I want to be obedient while keeping the fast, but do not want to become a ‚ÄúPharisee‚Äù, so to speak. 

I understand that ultimately, this must be taken to God in prayer and consulted with a spiritual father, but if anyone can give me advice, perhaps references to the church fathers as to how we should fast, I would be very grateful.

Seraphim Rose and ROCOR,MoreMathematic,1608333347,"[There was a conversation recently](https://fatallmistake.livejournal.com/162580.html?view=comments#comments), and I'm interested in your comments. I don't want to stir up a conflict or prove anything to anyone. I want to know how accurate the information we're getting is. Go.

\- *Such a ""bomb"" came from Seraphim Rose and is still quite quiet and ticking.*

\- *What's with the bomb from Rose?*

*- I will not hide it, there is a lot of my personal attitude here, because it affected my bishop. Studying the works of Rose, the Dutch diocese was confused and, according to the bishop, there were strong disturbances. We almost lost our flock in the Netherlands. And all why? Yes, because Rose supported the schism, was against the Eucharistic communion of the ROCOR and the ROC, recognized our Church as graceless. He wrote and spoke a lot on this topic. You can Google ""Rose and the ROC"", ""Rose and Sergianism"", and so on. Moreover, he wrote about the ""future of Russia"", but never even went there, and took the trouble to analyze the situation, which made him look like a rather superficial teacher and a dubious visionary.*

*In september, on the day of Rose's death, there are laudatory articles, even calls for Rose's canonization on our websites. I usually confine myself to testifying that we should be careful not to forget that Rose had dubious views, unorthodox. What begins here! up to the point of breaking up the relationship.*

*My bishop does not consider rose orthodox, even wrote to the patriarchate to stop printing his works, because the enthusiasm of the flock for Rose's books (and he is not devoid of literary talent and clearly read the holy fathers) may lead to the perception of his view of our church.*

*Rose is raised to the flag by the fragments of the ROCOR: Seraphim (Rose) on the heresy of sergianism:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XQjkb82eIw&amp;t=3s*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XQjkb82eIw&amp;t=3s)

*In short, if they push, then Rose will be canonized, and then the arguments will go on, as was already the case in Holland.*

*The soil is ready and everyone loves Rose.*

*- Yes, I noticed just the other day that some Foreign citizens still have a lively contempt for the Russian Church. However, I did not know that Fr. Seraphim was one of these:*

&gt;*Letter dated 5/18 May 1970*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The situation in the Orthodox world, alas, is not improving. Because of the connection of the Metropolia (the current ""Orthodox Church in America"") to the Soviet Church, it is now impossible to have Eucharistic communion with it.*

*And he has admirers...*

*As for his canonization and subsequent schism - I hope that God will not betray - the pig will not eat. With the same Rasputin, for example, they was scamper and now scamper, they tried to deceitfully use the authority of fr. Nikolai Guryanov, like ""Father blessed!"" - and all to no avail.*

*- With the ROCOR, even with those who are now with the MP, everything is difficult. A few years ago, our archpriest served a prayer service together with the ROCOR, and missed the name of His Holiness (later he left our diocese and his fate is not known to me). The wife, hearing such an ugliness, immediately left the walls of the temple. I was stupid and did it much later. I still feel my slowness as a perfect sin. We came out, there the ROCOR parishioners are happy to report that it is good that we have united, they say now we will stop hating each other. My wife and I looked at each other: and when did we hate them, it is unclear? In short, we no longer communicate.*

*There are a lot of lies about the elder Nicholas. He is even declared a secret bishop. And he wasn't. I have his personal testimony on this matter, which I am voicing here. I saw these shots with the elder and the"" icon "" of Rasputin - this is an obvious manipulation.*",OrthodoxChristianity

It is a heart on fire for the whole of creation, for humanity, for the birds, for the animals, for demons, and for all that exists. By the recollection of them the eyes of a merciful person pour forth tears in abundance. By the strong and vehement mercy that grips such a person‚Äôs heart, and by such great compassion, the heart is humbled and one cannot bear to hear or to see any injury or slight sorrow in any in creation. For this reason, such a person offers up tearful prayer continually even for irrational beasts, for the enemies of the truth, and for those who harm her or him, that they be protected and receive mercy. And in like manner such a person prays for the family of reptiles because of the great compassion that burns without measure in a heart that is in the likeness of God.

A concern of the one spiritual phenomenon (and a prayer request),RodionUA,1608228029,"Peace be to you all, Orthodox family!

I have one question on some¬†spiritual phenomenon that¬†I cannot fully understand. I think I know where it¬†came from, but anyway I need help and guidance from the Body of Christ. First, I shortly want to describe what I was experiencing this past week.¬†

Last Wednesday (09/12) I met with my close friends. We had such a great time together. We were discussing how we are doing, some christian topics (such as what¬†is the Gospel, how we can share it with unbelievers etc.). One of them was sharing what he read last week and what he is researching¬†for the university (he studies theology).¬†He started to tell he discovered a guy named Karl Gustav Jung (a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology). And here what happened ‚Äì when my friend was sharing his ideas, I was listening and something inside of me was resisting it so strong. In general, my friend‚Äôs thoughts were okay (such as we cannot judge anyone, we do not know if a specific person is saved or not, Christ died for everyone etc.). However, something was telling me that something is not right. I remember I asked: ‚ÄúOkay, but a human cannot change himself with just his on power, he needs God, right?‚Äù The answer was ‚Äúwell, actually he can, cuz Christ died for everyone and He granted everybody with His grace, it is already inside of people, they just need to find it and open up their potential‚Äù. Then he also mentioned that sometimes we highlight the form of the Gospel more than worrying about its core (again, sounds okay in general, but‚Ä¶). But when I also asked about dogmatic and how we should believe in Christ, he answered that it is also can be a form that sometimes we need to sacrifice for a person's sake. ¬†

After that day, I was praying and asking God if my friend‚Äôs ideas, gleaned from Jung‚Äôs teaching was right or no (just a small note: Karl Jung was connected to the occult things. Jung had an apparent interest in the paranormal and occult. For decades he attended seances and claimed to have witnessed ""parapsychic phenomena""). But the whole week I felt like something is forcing me to believe it. Something was saying like: ‚Äúyep, does not matter how you believe, the most important is to open up your inner potential, just do what is right and ¬†you‚Äôll be okay, doesn‚Äôt matter how you believe in Christ and are you in Christianity or no, just do good works‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know, it sounds ridiculous for me, but this voice or these thoughts I named ‚Äúa violence against will‚Äù, like something wanted me to believe that and forcing me, convincing me that those ideas I resisted inside of me, are okay! I remember I was praying Jesus‚Äôs prayer during that conversation.

Then other thoughts started to come. Something was saying like ‚Äúare you sure that God even exist? Are you sure that your God (meaning Jesus, the Son of God) is real, maybe there is other god. Are you sure that you have His Spirit? Maybe He doesn‚Äôt hear you, no prove Jesus is real (not a historical person, but as God Almighty)‚Äù. So these thoughts were getting over me for a long week, abusing (as I call it) my will and telling me that I have no choice but believe the way it says me to believe.

So, the peace of God left me, I was fighting a lot, praying and crying to God with tears, my soul was confused and disturbed, I had no rest, no peace, no calm. I know it came from the enemy, but sometimes I was like: ‚ÄúGod, it is so hard, please give me Your peace and comfort, I cannot bear it myself‚Äù. I hubmly ask your prayers and support in this unknown phenomenal for me. I believe that God is faithful and will strengthen &amp; lead me to the end.",OrthodoxChristianity

A link to that post is found* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/kcy5a4/i_a_catholic_think_i_just_destroyed_my_own_faith/)*.* 

*In the meantime, I've been investigating the evidence that both sides, and as I said that I would give you updates on how I was swinging, I've decided to write this post. I'm not done yet, and there will be more of these kinds of posts until I fall flatly on one side or another, I am after all, merely attempting to take Saint Vincent of Lerin's advice to heart, and what I do find along the way is a genuine attempt to find the truth of Christ.* 

*The issue it seems to me to boil down to a single issue: The Papacy. Other differences can be resolved, albeit somewhat awkwardly and not to everybody's liking, but they can be resolved nonetheless in charity and fraternity. The Catholic argument, and likewise, the Orthodox argument, relies on the central question of the claims of the Pope and whether or not they are true. Given the nature of those claims, I have divided the question into three categories: Papal Primacy, Papal Supremacy and Papal Infallibility.* 

**Papal Primacy and the Primacy of the Roman Church**

The object of this question is to find out ***if the Bishop of Rome has some kind of special position***. The exact nature of that position may be contested, or undefined, but it forms the pretext to Rome's further claims, and the objections raised by the Eastern Orthodox to those claims, so it seems to me to be a good starting point. 

Rome's claims rest on the fact that it is the see of Saint Peter and has inherited from Saint Peter an alleged special position received directly from Christ. 

***Can we reasonably believe that Saint Peter was the first bishop of Rome?***

Some on the Orthodox side have made the claim that Saint Linus, rather than Saint Peter, is the the first Bishop of Rome. After extensive study, it seems clear to me that we can rule that argument out. The earliest accounts of the episcopate in Rome all point to Saint Peter and Saint Paul as having established the Church there, with particular emphasis on Saint Peter. Saint Jerome writes of Saint Linus being bishop after Saint Peter, as does Saint John Chrysostom. The Liber Pontificalis concurs with these saints. The argument in favour of Saint Linus as the first Bishop of Rome appears to originate in a quote from Saint Irenaeus of Lyon saying that ""*the blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate*"". Now, whilst I understand the reason why some would interpret the above quote as stating that Linus was the first bishop of Rome, being installed by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, I am inclined to agree with Saints Jerome and Saint John on the matter. 

The tradition that Saint Peter was the first bishop is very old, pre-Constantinian, and given Saint Jerome's access to the historical material available in the city, I am inclined to agree with his judgement that Saint Peter acted as the first bishop, consecrating Saint Linus, Saint Anacletus and Saint Clement as bishops. As far as I can find, there is no dispute in the Nicene period that Saint Peter was the bishop of Rome, nor is there any challenge from Antioch, a see that is most definitely Petrine, that Rome was also founded by Saint Peter. The literature from the time is unanimous in describing Saint Peter as the founder of the bishopric of Rome.

Where I think those orthodox polemists have got things right is the numbering after Saint Peter; St. Linus is to be regarded as the second Bishop, not Saint Clement, as the Roman Church numbers him, being succeeded by Saint Anacletus and then by Saint Clement. So I think we can reasonably believe that Saint Peter is to be regarded as the first bishop of Rome, where he was martyred and his body now lies under his basilica in the Vatican. 

***What of Antioch?*** 

That Saint Peter established the Bishopric of Antioch is uncontested by both sides and the history would agree entirely with this. There is copious evidence from the earliest centuries that Saint Peter established Antioch as a see. There is, likewise, extensive evidence to suggest that Saint Peter resigned the see to go to Rome, and left Saint Evodius as the bishop of Antioch. 

Some have argued that this was what he intended to do in Rome as well. Establish the church, consecrate a successor, and move on. I find this argument lacking. The early accounts from the city of Rome state that Saint Peter consecrated Saints Linus, Anacletus and Clement, and remained in the city ""devoting himself to prayer and to preaching"". This seems logical. The ageing man, perhaps coming to the end of his natural life, weary from his missions, settling down in a final city, the heart of the pagan empire at its zenith, to establish the Church there. He consecrated clergy to assist him in the mission, and designated Linus as his successor, as was standard practice in the Roman world. The outbreak of the Jewish wars would have brought plenty of Palestinians to the city and among them would be some Christians, and potential converts, as well as a significant Hellenic population. Rome's position as the centre for all trade routes in the Mediterranean also makes it the logical choice for Saint Peter to establish as a bishopric from where he can oversee and communicate with missionary efforts further west, all the while maintaining good links with the east. 

Thus I think it is probable and reasonable that Rome had a ""special"" place for Saint Peter and that he did not intend on leaving the city. The fact that he was martyred in the city, alongside Saint Paul, only added to the prestige of the early church in Rome, and the city's position as head and capital of the Empire at the time, and then its subsequent role as a religious and ceremonial capital after the crisis of the third century, all lent the Church of Rome a significant dignity and prestige. The number of martyrs found in the city, as well as the presence of two of the apostles, only further exalted its position in early Christian minds. Thus it is not surprising that in the earliest designations of the Patriarchates, Rome is described as first, Antioch second and Alexandria third. 

***In the earliest centuries, did the Church of Rome have a special ""primacy""?***

It is clear that Rome held a certain place of distinction in early Christian literature. For the reasons outlined in the paragraph above, Rome had developed, very early on, a sense of its own primacy, and was regarded as the ""first"" by most Christians. 

Saint Irenaeus of Lyon, writing sometime in the second century, described the Roman Church as being ""very ancient and universally known, founded and organised at Rome by the blessed Apostles"". He goes on to say that all churches must agree with Rome on account of its ""*pre-eminent authority*"". Now, before the Catholics start jumping with joy waving fingers at the Eastern Orthodox, I will point out that this is merely a quote from a Saint (have a look at what Saint Thomas Aquinas said about the Immaculate Conception if you think Saints are always right), not scripture. It is not binding upon the faithful, and it should only be read as meaning that all churches should agree with Rome as it was at the time of Irenaeus' writing, not necessarily forever and until the end of time. Nonetheless, it does point strongly to the idea that Rome had already found, within a century of its foundation, a position of, according to Saint Irenaeus, ""pre-eminent authority"". ***The exact nature of that authority is unclear***. Nonetheless, it shows that early on, Rome had developed, at the very least, the ""Primacy of Honour"" that both sides agree on. 

This primacy of honour is well established in the early church, and it is clear that there was no one seriously arguing that Rome was not the ""protos"". Saint Ignatius of Antioch clearly states that Rome is ""first"" and that it ""*presides in love*"", when his own see is older than Rome and can also claim a Petrine origin. Likewise, there are numerous accounts from the Fathers that describe Rome as ""First"" and ""Head"". However, just as in the case of Saint Irenaeus' designation, ***what this actually entails is unclear and undefined***.  

Finally, we can look at the 6th Canon of the Council of Nicaea which explicitly described Rome, Alexandria and Antioch as being special sees. Their authority is not limited to their own local province. Later Councils would raise Constantinople and Jerusalem, thus creating the Pentarchy, but it must be remembered that both Rome and Alexandria opposed this move. Rome rejected it saying that violated Nicaea, and both Antioch and Alexandria were opposed to it. It was only later that Antioch and Alexandria accepted the new designations, and it would take Rome until the fifteenth century to accept the new designation. However, whatever the case, it was clearly established the Rome came first, followed by Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria and Jerusalem. 

**What this primacy meant**

We have now established that Rome had a primacy of honour, and some kind of undefined authority. The exalted position of Rome that had been established already by the second century lent weight to its judgement in disputes. This much is clear. 

In the early centuries, Rome did seem to occupy a position as an arbiter, a settler of disputes. Thus, there is copious evidence that bishops from across the Christian world wrote to Rome for support in one case or another. The historical record is simply too great to ignore that consultations, letters and appeals were sent especially to Rome, more so than other Patriarchates. This however is not necessarily an endorsement of the Catholic argument. Rome's position as ""protos"", its ""primacy of honour"" and its ""presiding in love"" certainly lent serious weight to cases brought for its judgement, and thus explains why it was especially sought in disputes. It must also be noted that in none of the early ecumenical councils was Rome accorded this position of authority, or arbitration, or recourse. Rather, it was the actions of individual synods and bishops that actively sought Roman intervention that explains this weight of material, rather than a canonically established system. 

There are cases in the historical record, where the Bishop of Rome intervenes outside his own particular ""regio"". The most famous example of this is the intervention of Saint Clement in the Church of Corinth. Likewise, there are other examples from the early centuries of the Bishops of Rome excommunicating, or threatening to excommunicate those who lay within the jurisdiction of others. As well as that, there is definite evidence that Rome *attempted* to impose its own teaching on other sees early on. This much is true, but it should be noted that I have emphasised ""attempted"". It was not always successful in getting its own way, and there are plenty of examples where the Bishop of Rome was ignored, or opposed, by the church in the east, and in the west. 

It can be argued that the Bishop of Rome occupied a position of authority that was implicit to his occupation of the see of Rome, but the nature of that authority is disputed and unknown. It may be that he was seen as being particularly authoritative, or it may be the case that he accrued a sense of his own authority from the delegations he received from across the Christian world, as well as from the disputes he was asked to judge, but that this was a sense of self that was not recognised outside the patriarchate of Rome. The conclusion to that question will be the subject of the next study, Papal Supremacy. 

**Conclusion**

It is certain that the Church of Rome possessed a Primacy in the early church. It is reasonable to assume therefore that the Bishop of Rome also possessed that primacy. What that primacy means is not yet clear, but it certainly existed.

Questions about Prayer Books,Chatechized,1608177615,"So I come from a Protestant background (Reformed) and never used a prayer book until last year when I bought and started using the 2019 Book of Common Prayer. It's beautiful, clear, and has the old school psalter that, to my knowledge, has yet to be matched in English. But, I'm becoming less and less Protestant. The local Orthodox priest I spoke with suggested a prayer book to get more in touch with the way the church has prayed for centuries so it piqued my interest. This year has been very very difficult and my faith hasn't been great and I can't remember the last time I prayed so this might do me good.






Part of me is very sad that I might no longer use this prayer book as it is beautiful and I feel very connected with it. On the other hand, part of me is very confused about how this works in Orthodoxy. For Anglicans, you may certainly use other prayers and prayer books but the ""rule of life"" is from the Book of Common Prayer and that garnered structure for me when I had it. My question is firstly, is there such a ""true blue for sure THE"" prayer book in Orthodoxy? Or are Orthodox prayer books basically just generally accepted prayers that don't constitute a rule of life but rather give a certain layout and many are different? 





If it's the latter, I saw [this]( https://andrewespress.com/the-book-of-common-prayer/) prayer book that's of the Western Rite that might tickle my itch but I can't say it's quite as beautiful or seemingly as handy as the [one I have]( https://anglicanhousepublishers.org/shop/the-book-of-common-prayer-2019-deluxe-leather-edition/).

"The ""Eastern Rosary"" and using a Catholic Rosary",Training-Double701,1608154389,"So I have a question for you all that I could use some clearing up on, I have a very nice rosary from my brief time as a Catholic catechumen before I realized that Orthodoxy was truly where I was being called.

"Does the Torah Foreshadows Mother Mary at all?

But I heard Jews argue this is all bunk since to start with most of what is classified as Old Testament are not really strict canon to Judaism but most Old Testament stuff is more like supplementary stuff to Jewish religion and are not supposed to be followed strictly. They are to be disregarded in prophecy and as far as sins go, are more like general guidelines than strict church or more accurately synagogue rules. And that its actually the Torah thats the real sacred book of Judaism. So they use this argument why most foreshadowing is baloney.


I already seen people take quotes from the first 5 Book of Moses to support predictions of Jesus's coming in the New Testament. But where as people can find stuff foreshadowing Mary in the whole Old Testament very easily, unlike Jesus analysis of strictly the ""Torah"" part of the New Testament in regards to Mary is almost nonexistent esp on the internet.

Created Grace - Catholic/Orthodox Reunion,feeble_stirrings,1607985353,"Lots of Catholic related questions today so I figured I'd jump in. I'm reading ""The Deification of Man"" by Georgios Mantzaridis, in which he discusses the Orthodox Church's teaching on Theosis a la St. Gregory Palamas. I'm still in the earlier parts of the book, but he's talking about about the differences between the Orthodox Church's understanding of Grace as uncreated and God's very energies vs. the Catholic teaching of created grace. Palamas takes this pretty serious and implies the concept of created grace forever removes the possibility of man's direct union with God - i.e. the heart of our understanding of Salvation.   


In any thing I've ever read about the possibility of reunion between Orthodox and Catholics, the two main hurdles that need to be addressed are listed as Papal infallibility/supremacy and the filioque.

#1) Regarding baptism, can someone ELI5; ‚Äî specifically, what are the technical differences and effects when it comes to baptism in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church?

#2) This question sort of ties in with the first: in the Roman Catholic Church, we believe that ‚Äúconcupiscence‚Äù (our inclination to sin) still remains after baptism, and it is my understanding that the Orthodox view sin differently, and so am wondering, do Orthodox hold a similar view? If not, why do we continue to sin after baptism? 

#3) Is there salvation outside the Orthodox Church? And what I am getting at with this question, let‚Äôs say someone like myself, an inquirer, dies before I enter the Orthodox Church. I understand this is up to God, but in Catholic circles the approach seems quite hardline, especially when it comes down to the state of your soul at the moment of death, rather than your disposition or your desire for repentance. 

#4) Are we all sons and daughters of God, and how? The theological meaning behind this, I would like to know, and also, what does it mean to be a child of God and yet outside of the fullness of the church (if that makes sense).

"I, a Catholic, think I just destroyed my own faith and am left with only Orthodoxy....",Breifne21,1607954485,"So, yesterday, my priest gave us a sermon on Papal Infallibility. His final line caused serious discomfort to me. ""so central is this teaching, that to reject one iota of it is to reject the Catholic faith in its entirety"". I sat there completely shell shocked. I didn't even stand for the Credo for a few minutes. 

I've always had issues with Papal Infallibility, and being honest, I simply don't believe in it as Vatican I taught. I've always reasoned that its because the fullness of the dogma has not yet been revealed and that a future council will explain it properly. 

However, now I'm having serious doubts about it all. Then all the other things started to crop up. I don't really believe in indulgences either, and then there are all these other things popping up and I'm standing in front of my crucifix wondering if I've got the whole thing wrong all these years, have I been suffering for a faith that isn't really true? 

You see, when I looked at it, I realised that my objections to Catholic doctrine, are dogmatic and are pretty central to the faith. My objections to Orthodoxy however are based on the fractious nature of church relations within the worldwide Church. That's not something to discount, but it is not dogmatic, its ecclesiological, an administrative or political issue. 

If I have dogmatic issues with Catholicism, but only see administrative issues with Orthodoxy, my remaining in Catholicism is untenable, and my avoidance of Orthodoxy is unsustainable.

Yet another of those posts from a doubting Catholic,Breifne21,1607937622,"God be praised. 

I'm sorry that this will be yet another one of those posts you see from Catholics here, but I had a strange experience yesterday at Mass and it has got things rolling in my head. 

I am pretty convinced of the truth of the Catholic faith, and any thought I've put into Eastern Orthodoxy (which admittedly has not been a huge amount) has always brought me back to being more convinced as a Catholic. However, during the sermon yesterday, our priest gave a round up on Papal Infallibility. He finished up with ""this truth is so central to the faith, that to reject it, is to reject the Catholic faith in its entirety"". That line left me shell shocked. 

Papal Infallibility has always bothered me. If I'm honest, I do not believe in infallibility as Vatican I imagined it, but I've always kind of suppressed that by telling myself that a future council will clarify the fullness of infallibility and I'll just submit myself to the rulings of the Church now. Any doubts that arise about the teaching cause me to suppress it immediately, or I avoid the conversation entirely. 

The thing is that, when I really think about it, I simply don't believe you guys have it completely right either. There is a need for a head in a college, there needs to be a final recourse in disputes. As powerful the Pope may seem, lots of that authority is necessary in the governance of a worldwide faith, and I think that even you would recognise there are **some** benefits to having a Pope. 

Anyway, I'm nothing if not open minded, so could you guys link me with some good resources that attack the Catholic position, preferably video links or lectures online instead of books and articles, I'd be extremely grateful.

I would like to have more extended evening (and morning) prayers. I'll likely do morning prayers on my own once I start up at work again.

My question: do any of you have to compromise your desired prayer rule to accommodate children? Do you repeat the same prayers at a later/earlier time on your own? How do people manage this?

# The Sunday of the Holy Forefathers.Eleventh Sunday of Luke.Parable of the Great Supper.Metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh.

 In these days of fasting as we approach the festival of the Incarnation, the Church gives us in the words of Christ Himself, a stern and clear warning. Are we going to be like the guests called to the bridal feast of the king‚Äôs son? One refused to come because he had acquired a plot of land. He wanted to possess the earth and instead became a slave to it. The others could not come because they were too busy‚Äîthere was no time for God. The one who had taken a wife could not share in the joy of the Bridegroom because his heart was already too full. This parable will be read on December 14, just two Sundays before the Winter Pascha. How do we respond to the invitation?

Question about joining the Church,MysteryTA,1607819496,"I have been attending a local parish for a few months.

I have been accepted as a catechumen, and have discussed baptism with the priest. Not really being familiar with the practises of the Orthodox Church in this regard there are two things that have struck me as potentially unusual.

The first thing is how quickly the priest is willing to allow me to join. He seems happy to baptise me at some point in January. I do wish to join the church but I'm not sure whether this is a bit rushed? I've not received a huge amount of catechism aside from book recommendations... I feel I know the faith well enough to know I want to join, but that is mostly off my own back and I haven't really specified that to the priest. It seems like he assumes I'm doing that, but I don't know how usual it is to be entrusted to catechise oneself.

Also he raised with me that there would be a fee for the service of baptism. The reason he gave was that the service would be outside of his usual schedule and on his time and also the Church itself would take a cut. It's not a vast amount but it is also not a small amount of money either. I have no idea if this is a normal practice or not. I'm not against this, but along with the speediness of it all it struck me as a possible red flag.

I do wish to join a church, but I have some reservations both about the fees and the speed with which they seem willing to receive me. I have no yardstick for knowing whether I am right to be suspicious of this or not. I figured a good means might be to ask on here, as I'm unlikely to get told my local parish is a bit iffy by its own members if it is...",OrthodoxChristianity

Questions about confession,athumbhat,1607816151,"Is it necessary to confess EVERY sin?

Is there the same concept of an ""invalid confession"" as with catholicism -if one purposefully omits a sin (mortal sin, or grave sin as we would call it, also what's the difference?) then the ENTIRE confession is invalidated and must be redone, not just the one sin?

How did early church fathers such as Origen deal with sayings attributed to the Lord in their allegorising/denial of historicity of OT narratives?,MarysDowry,1607778291,"I posted this on /r/academicbiblical but I thought I'd post here as some of you guys are famailiar with Gregory and Origens works.

-------------------------------------------

I am interested in how exegetes who denied the historicity of various OT events, interpreting them allegorically, dealt with the issue of sayings attributed directly to God.

For example Gregory of Nyssa speaks against the killing of the firstborn being fitting for God and says to not be surprised if these events did not occur. So I am wondering, given that its recorded as God having said certain things concerning this event like ""I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn"", how would they have dealt with this?

Another example, Origen seems to deny the literal nature of the planting of the tree in Eden, so how would he have dealt with statements attributed to God in genesis that were contingent with the historicity of these events?

Apologies if these is too theological, although I am mainly concerned on the history of the exegetical method here and how they understood scriptural innerancy in light of their allegorising.",OrthodoxChristianity

&gt;My dearest brother, we do not deny to the Roman Church the primacy among the five sister Patriarchates, and we recognize her right to the most honorable seat at an Ecumenical Council. But she separated herself from us by her own deeds, when she assumed a monarchy which does not belong to her office.‚ÄØ.‚ÄØ.‚ÄØ. How shall we accept decrees from her that have been issued without consulting us, and even without our knowledge?

&gt;If the Roman pontiff, seated on the lofty throne of his glory, wishes to thunder at us from on high, and if he wishes to judge us and even to rule us and our churches, not by taking counsel with us but at his own arbitrary pleasure, what kind of brotherhood or even what kind of parenthood can this be? We would be the slaves of such a church, and the Roman see would not be the pious mother of sons but a hard and imperious mistress of slaves.‚ÄØ.‚ÄØ.‚ÄØ. In such a case what could have been the use of the Scriptures? The writings and the teachings of the Fathers would be useless. The authority of the Roman pontiff would nullify the value of all because he would be the only bishop, the sole teacher and master.

Useful ways to help the poor/homeless?,loveICXC,1607611576,"This week I have felt a heavy heart for our brothers and sisters who are unable to afford basic living costs and those who do not have a home and live on the streets. I found a YouTube channel that interviews the homeless and I am so distraught over their situation...it is heartbreaking.

I am turning to God in prayer as to what to do with these feelings. I feel so terrible knowing that each of these people does not have what they need to get through the day, and worse that later in my day I complain and fail to give thanks for what I do have. 

How as a Christian can we/I help our brothers and sisters in these situations? I live in a big city so I try my best to have cash or offer to buy a meal for someone if I am approached...it just weighs so heavily on my heart that there are so many helpless in the world at any given time. I know we must also pray for their condition, but does anyone have any additional suggestions on how to help these people, directly or indirectly?

A few (critical) questions about Orthodoxy from an interested outsider,JamieOfArc,1607467949,"Hi, I am currently comparing different religions and try to figure out which religion is true. Right now I tend towards Christianity, even though I am not 100% sure yet. If I became a Christian, the next step would be to find out which church represents the true teachings of Jesus. Orthodoxy seems very intersting to me but some issues bother me. Maybe you can help me solve my problems here. These are kind of ""critical"" questions. I am not asking them to provoke but to find out the truth! Please pray for me!

1. There are studies that show that Eastern Europe (the only predominantly orthodox place) is one of the more unhappy places in the world. I would assume that the true faith makes people happy. If Orthodoxy is the truth, why isnt Eastern Europe one of the happiest places? Or would you say that this has nothing to do with religion and more with culture and maybe lasting effects of communist dictatorship?
2. Jesus told his disciples to bring the gospel to all nations. Catholics and Protestants have done that (even though not always peaceful unfortunately). Today we have Catholics and Protestants all around the world. However, Orthodoxy seems to exist only in Eastern Europe. If Orthodoxy is true, why havent Orthodox christians spread the gospel to more places?
3. In the Old Testament we see that God allows hostile armies to conquer Israel if He is not pleased with them. After the Schism in the 11th century, God allowed Constantinople to be conquered twice by its enemies: 1204 and 1453. Could that be used as an argument from the catholic side to claim hat God was not pleased with the Orthodox and gave them over to their enemies because they didnt accept Rome's authority?

Any accounts (whether it's you or someone else) of experiencing negative consequences from unworthily receiving the Eucharist?,AshenDisciple,1607393157,,OrthodoxChristianity
Attending different churches?,KingLothric1,1607389625,"Hey,

Is it permissible to partake in the Eucharist in a Greek orthodox church one week, and then in a Serbian orthodox church the other week? In other words, is partaking in the Eucharist fine as long as it is an Eastern orthodox church?

Also, if one belongs to the oriental orthodox denomination but wishes to convert to the Eastern orthodox faith, what kind of transition can one in general expect? Could it be as easy as a chat with the priest and bam, done?",OrthodoxChristianity
Interested in Orthodoxy,MtnDew-Wampa14,1607382146,"Im in High School and since I was born I have been a Christian. I never really identified as a Catholic or Protestant although the place I am from is heavily Catholic. I mostly just considered myself a Fundamentalist. I was never very devout, I read very little scripture, only went to Church on Christmas and Easter, and I did not pray often or educate myself on the faith a whole lot. Recently I feel like I have been losing faith in the Lord and have been looking for answers. In the past few days I think I have found one. I have been reading about Orthodoxy and listening to Orthodox Christians on YouTube. It is such a beautiful faith from what I have seen and I believe it will help me restore my faith in God and Christ. This year has been full of changes, learning, and resolutions. I still have a lot to learn. I would love to hear from Orthodox Christians about how they practice and what their experience with the Church has been like. God Bless‚ù§Ô∏è",OrthodoxChristianity

"Original &amp; legitimate source of the ""Phanar head: Full unity will crown Catholics-Orthodox"" article that was taken down.",xrphabibi,1607365283,"[https://www.pro-oriente.at/?site=ne20201201215721](https://www.pro-oriente.at/?site=ne20201201215721)

Here is the original source of the article that was taken down on this subreddit, which most people mocked as ""propaganda"".  


Pro Oriente is a foundation that was established by Cardinal Franz K√∂nig during the Second Vatican Council on November 4, 1964 in Vienna. This is a legitimate source, not some cooky ""alternative"" source. It's a legally registered ""stiftung"" in Austria and was a key part of the **Vienna Christological Formula** agreement between the Roman Catholic Church and the Oriental Orthodox Church in 1972.

Monday Morning prayer from Meditations on the Lord's Prayer by Mother Alexandra.,promise2keepup,1607362561,"To You my Creator, the cause of all my life and being, I dedicate this day. To You, who I owe my life in all its forms, I give myself wholeheartedly. From You come my thoughts, my power to think, to rationalize and put my ideas into action. To You I owe my body and my feelings; from You I have my hands and feet, my eyes and my tongue. I yearn this day to use all that I am to that purpose for which You have created me.
 
I long to be Your child in thought and word and deed, to love You with all my heart, with all my soul, with all my mind. 

Father, You are everywhere and yet nothing encompasses, nameless but no name is worthy of You, You infinite one, who in Your heavenly Glory can yet comprehend my finite need and boundless longing, hear my prayer: let this day bring me closer to You.

What does it mean when we say that Jesus Christ is the repose of his servants?,Charis_Humin,1607361903,"In our memorial service the priest prays, ""O God of spirits and of all flesh, You trampled upon death and abolished the power of the devil, giving life to Your world. Give rest to the soul(s) of Your departed servant(s) (Name) in a place of light, in a place of green pasture, in a place of refreshment, from where pain, sorrow, and sighing have fled away. As a good and loving God, forgive every sin he (she, they) has (have) committed in word, deed, or thought, for there is no one who lives and does not sin. You alone are without sin. Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and Your word is truth.

""For You are the resurrection, the life, and the repose of Your departed servant(s) (Name), Christ our God, and to You we offer glory, with Your eternal Father who is without beginning and Your all-holy, good, and life-creating Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.'""
