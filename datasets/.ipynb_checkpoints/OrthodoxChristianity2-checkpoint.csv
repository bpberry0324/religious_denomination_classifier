Path to becoming Orthodox,scratchEballs,1607332849,"Hi all,

I've been contemplating becoming Orthodox, and it's seems to be really pulling me towards it. Today I am going to Catholic mass and Thursday I will go to Orthodox mass, just to make sure I am making the right decision (although I'm 90% sure I will go for Orthodox, as my problems with Catholicism is the Pope and losing tradition). 

Anyway, I have read getting an Eastern Orthodox endorsed study Bible is a good way to start you path in the Orthodox Christian faith.

Also any other information that will help guide me on the right path I will be very grateful for :) Thanks!",OrthodoxChristianity

I guess I need to become an Eastern Orthodox Christian,WonderingAboutTruth2,1607302063,"Well, this is it. Short summary of my story: I’m an ex-Jehovah’s Witness that left the cult very recently by studying about the Holy Trinity and Church History. Initially, I was very attracted to Roman Catholicism, because it was all I knew in terms of an “apostolic church”, you know. And I liked (I still do in all honesty!) scholasticism, and the way the Catholics try to harmonize reason with faith. For a short while, everything was perfect and I was absolutely sure that this was the right option, and that it was so obvious, etc. I started RCIA too. 

Then a friend of mine introduced me to Orthodoxy. Some YouTube channels, some readings. I started to know all about the polemics, how Catholics started changing stuff way before Vatican 2, the Filioque. And I started to be more critical of the current state of the Church, and how so many mutually exclusive positions are permitted inside the communion, such as Traditionalism and Charismatic Movement. The trigger for me was the civil union statement by Pope Francis. And, in all honesty, I don’t know if he’s an actual heretic, or if the clarifications in this matter aren’t enough; today, after much realised, I simply realised I can’t have faith that my salvation is dependent on being under onde bishop at all costs. And, ultimately, I don’t want to reject all I read about the Catholic Church, all the beauty I saw. But I want to be close with Jesus. And I can’t be a good Christian if I remain a paranoid Catholic, suspicious of everything coming out of Rome, being critical of basically everything and everyone and living in anguish with the current situation there in the Church, the contradictions I know are today alive, and some of those that took place in the past. So, ultimately, in order for me to still be Catholic, I must become Orthodox. That’s the way it is.

Orthodoxy, after all, has kept the apostolic tradition intact and preserved. Inside Catholicism, on the other hand, I have to justify many developments. Being pretty pragmatic, the “safe” choice seems clear. 

I don’t think I have the answers for everything, and I’m not with as much certainty as I once was before. But I genuinely think this is the best decision for my life and my relationship with God. I feel an immense relief. And I know my life in the Church it’s just about to get started now, and it’s not going to be easy, but I’m very grateful for getting so far. Thanks everyone here for the helpful posts and replies to my own posts. I ask for your prayers for me to have the strength to go along the Orthodox path.",OrthodoxChristianity

Considering converting to Orthodoxy. Pray for me please.,StrawberryDong,1607297636,"Greetings. I’m a member of the Episcopal church in the US heavily considering converting to orthodoxy. While there are many things and people that I love in the Episcopal church, the liberalism and lack of unified teaching have always worried me. A big part of me wants to run to mother church and rest in her despite not understanding some things. Most of protestantism leaves you to decide what to believe, but who am I to discern the will of God? 

I’m tired of reaching to justify my own actions and beliefs and the actions and beliefs of my church body. I want to worship Christ and do His will, not shape Christianity into how I like it. I want to live the historic faith. I want to be able to read St. Paul’s letters without cringing.

I’ve got so many anchors that make this conversion hard. I love everyone I went to church with and especially my priests. I have a girlfriend who I thought would be the one I marry. If I tell her no more premarital sex and that I’m converting to a non lgbt accepting church, I can’t imagine that will go well. I love her and am afraid to leave her but I know Christ encouraged us to forsake all for the Kingdom.

Question about Rock and Sand by Fr. Josiah Trenham,Chatechized,1607285607,"This may seem silly, but here goes.



I recently got some birthday money from a friend that I used to by Rock and Sand by Fr. Josiah Trenham, as I'm considering other branches of the faith away from Evangelicalism. This was recommended to me by some of you and I thank you for your time. I was impressed by his youtube interviews about the book and thought it was a safe bet.





The more I looked into him and his work however, the more nervous I got. In the Reformed tradition, we have guys that converted to Reformed Theology and pick up the most popular works on election they find, only to be stuck in a world that really isn't representative of the faith, the tradition, and frankly, Christ. James White or John MacArthur come to mind. The latter especially, since he's a dispensationalist reactionary who has preached Trinitarian heresy (though he recanted) and made himself pope and true guard of the Kingdom on more than one occasion (""If you don't believe in 6 literal 24 hour day creation, you can't believe the gospel and likely aren't Christian,""). I see some of these things in Fr. Trenham, especially in his harsh and conspiratorial words on the LGBTQ community and COVID. I don't know much about the guy and I'm new to this subculture so forgive me, but from my past experience, I know where this stuff tends to go.







So my question is, should I cancel this order or his is book a very honest and fair introduction to Orthodoxy as opposed to Protestantism? And for someone who already is familiar with the history and doctrine of Protestantism's different branches, would I even benefit from it? Or should I appreciate him at a distance and delve into other works? Thanks for your time!",OrthodoxChristianity
How to discern through prayer?,MarysDowry,1607283508,"This might sound like a dumb question, but I am interested in how exactly one goes about 'praying about' something they are discerning.

The obvious answer would be to just ask God what you should do, but with God in a sense its a one way conversation with no direct answer, so how do you go about actually prayerfully discerning Gods will?

Take for example if you wanted to discern which way to take a career, how do you discern such a thing through prayer?

I'm not sure how you can seperate your own mental thought process from any kind of movement of the will which comes from Gods grace, what is to stop you misinterpreting your mental thought processes as Gods hand?",OrthodoxChristianity
"Today should have been my first Sunday at church post-baptism. Just as I was leaving for church, I recived a text from my godfather (present and in close proximity with me at my baptism 4 days ago) saying he had some symptoms and had been tested for Covid.",athumbhat,1607282417,"I went anyways, but stayed away from everyone else, after about 2 minutes I decided to leave, I was indecisive about this and paced a bit between my car and the Church, looking up symptoms and seeing how common my Godfathers were for Covid(somewhat uncommon, but they are symptoms)

Eventually I decided that if I went, and his test came back positive, that it would bother me for the rest of my life, so I left.

Now, Im at online church, watching a live stream, feeling awful. Especially since this means no communion.

I don't know if I did the right thing not going, I myself have no symptoms. In addition, somewhat comical as it may sound, I not only feel bad for not going, but I also feel bad for going for those few minutes(theres a temp. taker(mine was fine) near the entrance who, if I have covid, I may have infected). 

Also a practical question, I either made the right or the wrong choice by not going, and I will bring it up in confession, but how can I both repent for going to church and for not going to church? They contradict., also how can I repent if I'm not certain I made the wrong choice(that is, im not certain I wouldn't do it again in the same circumstances) Surely whether or not I made the right choice(morally) is independent of whether my godfathers test comes back positive.

Truth be told, if this was my 100th or maybe even my 2nd Sunday post baptism, I probably would have stayed home and watched live stream with little thought, but this was supposed to be my first, and it really upsets me.",OrthodoxChristianity

I’m at an impasse,TryingToUnderStand93,1607211292,"Good evening 

It has been roughly 2 to 3 weeks since I last posted here . I have been going to the Orthodox Church every since and I love it. Everyone there has been so helpful , welcoming , loving , and kind . I don’t have enough good words to describe them . That being said , I’m at an impasse. 

At part of me , a very loud part of me is screaming how that I’m a fake . How that I don’t even truly believe that heaven even exist . Truth be told, I don’t know if heaven exist . I pray that heaven exist and I behave/ act that it does but I honestly don’t know. 

That part of me is screaming how that I am faking all of it. How no matter what I do that I won’t ever get what I want which is salvation. 

I don’t know what do besides pray and ask for God’s mercy.Any advice , suggestion , videos , readings , and etc would be extremely  helpful 

PS : a lot of things have happened during the last 2 weeks . My family found out that I’m going to an Orthodox Church and I have to have a heart to heart conversation with them about my relationship with Jesus , God , my former religion and orthodoxy. 

When I was a Catholic I was never concerned about how comedians/ the media use the imagery of the devil to make jokes. However I recently watched a Mint Mobile commercial and when I saw the devil ( yes I know that it wasn’t the real devil but still ) , I felt sick .

"I'm a Protestant looking for books/resources the Orthodox would call ""Tradition""",Steve2762,1607200922,"Orthodox community, 

I am trying to understand Orthodox Christianity and the commitment to authoritative, Apostolic Tradition. I would guess that some history would not qualify as Tradition, and the church would not count it as binding, while some Tradition is so established that it is authoritative in the eyes of the church. 

We (I'm in the Presbyterian Church in America, PCA) affirm the Apostles' Creed, the 381 A.D. Nicene Creed (with the Filioque. I know we would differ on this), the Chalcedonian Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The Ante-Nicene, Nicene, and Post-Nicene Fathers, I'm guessing the Orthodox would affirm most of these volumes as well? 

Michael Holmes produced a book called the Apostolic Fathers ([https://www.amazon.com/Apostolic-Fathers-Greek-English-Translations/dp/080103468X](https://www.amazon.com/Apostolic-Fathers-Greek-English-Translations/dp/080103468X)), which has the Greek and English side-by-side. It contains many letters from Clement, Ignatius, Polycarp's Letter to the Philippians, and The Martyrdom of Polycarp. This looks likes a book that would qualify as Apostolic Tradition. 

Is there a list that the Orthodox Church affirms as THE Tradition of the Church? Where do you draw the line on real, apostolic tradition versus history that is not authoritative at all? Are these strict categories?

Getting back to Alpaca’s issues...,FulkNera,1607187588,"Echoing the recent post by the Rhodesian Alpaca, let me emphasize the salient points. 

Firstly, being a sincere Christian does not make you an expert on anything other than your own soul. Problematically, our religious edifice places seemingly-qualified men in a position of authority and even power. From these heights many speak loudly and broadly to contemporary life issues, and it seems the louder they talk the less intelligent they sound. I notice many Orthodox clergy and lay experts are kicking against the pricks of a society that does not acknowledge their expertise nor honor their personages. They want to see a Christian America shining on a hill where their Christian righteousness is celebrated and their safe voices heeded by the multitudes. I hope you can see where this ends up, before we get there. 

Also, being a sincere Christian does not guarantee intelligent reception of any news or insight. Often Christians are unaware of their dark side, their primitive atavistic urges, fears and prejudices. Poorly listening to poorly enunciated statements from men speaking outside their area of specialty results in noetic disasters, cultish behavior and despair.

Infallibility of elders and hierarchs,RhodesianAlpaca,1607175794,"Hello everyone! This is an issue that I have been concerned about for some time:

We all have knowledge of the conspiracies about COVID, the mark of the beast, Bill Gates, vaccines and all that. The internet is full of them and a lot of Orthodox Christians in my country tend to believe in these conspiracies.

But what really worries me is the fact that many Orthodox priests and especially elders tend to spread the same messages. My parents told me that they've been to a number of elders across the country and they declared the same conspiracy-related statement. For instance:

* This whole pandemic is the first step in setting up the New World Order by imposing totalitarian measures and restricting all kinds of freedoms.
* There is a hidden elite who wants to shut down all religious practice (especially in my country and in the Orthodox countries), some group who order all the countries to do the same.
* Priests, monks, bishops, metropolitans and patriarchs are actually killed by getting infected with the virus. It's not that they accidentally get infected, they are somehow assassinated (!!!).
* Wearing mask means that you don't have faith in Christ and that the vaccine is obviously the mark of the beast. Basically, accepting the vaccine is like accepting the seal, and no one without the seal will be able to buy, travel, work or live properly in society.
* I have even read [this article](https://spzh.news/en/news/73674-maska--instrument-dyjavola-jej-ne-mesto-v-khrame--ijerarkhi-elladskoj-cerkvi) saying that the mask is a demonic invention, an opinion shared by some clerics in my country.
* Wearing mask in church means you don't have faith in Christ. 
* People should consider leaving the cities and retreating into the mountains or wilderness, because it will be impossible to live within society (I see Archimandrite Urgebadze being citied in this matter).

There are so many theories going on, and unfortunately there are so many Orthodox websites that promote them and label themselves as anti-government and true Orthodox (very traditionalist). What is more disheartening for me is that these things are also declared by some elders, which adds even more doubt to my heart. Even when I spoke to my parents about this and said that I am against any sort of conspiracies, they replied that the elders that they've been to cannot be wrong because their minds are enlightened by God and are much more spiritually advanced than any of us.

My question is: can elders or hierarchs be wrong about these sort of statements or predictions? As a matter of fact, are elders, bishops, metropolitans and patriarchs infaillible? (when preaching or talking about religious matters)",OrthodoxChristianity

I have found a very creepy item in my hometown house. Nobody is living here,Milosh556,1607114258,"I have a house back at my hometown. The house isn't isolated or creepy at all, it's actually close to the main square of the town with many neighbours around it. I sleep there oftenly, maybe every 2 weeks I stay there for a day or two. Today I came and left my things in the bedroom. I went out with friends. Absolutely nobody has the key to this house and it's a 2 story house, with the bedroom being on the second floor. The windows have curtains and blinds. When I came back, at around 8 pm, 2-3 hours later, literally next to my things I found a weird car toy, on the floor. It was like a barbie girl sitting in a pink-white cabrio with a red barbie logo on the doors. I have no pictures, I decided it's best I don't take pictures of it. Now the toy is obviously a girls toy, but I have never seen this toy in my life. Nobody has lived here for decades. Even as a kid, I used to stay there for weeks/months but I spent most of my childhood in a city closeby. I call it my hometown because it's where I made friends and it's where my parents are from. Also I'd understand if there was a little girl living there a long time ago but I have no siblings whatsoever. My things were on the floor next to the bed. There are no wardrobes or drawers nearby, the toy did not fall out of anywhere. I have packed my things and I am leaving, going home. I am scared to shit. If it helps, I am from Poland. I have never heard of anyone having this happen to them. I left the toy outside of the house, I will come back in a few days likely. I didn't want to throw it in the trash, I don't want to mess something up. Does anyone have any idea what this means or has anyone had this happen to them before?I chose to ask here because I'd assume you could help me findout what is the meaning behind this.

(noob Catholic) Knelt during an entire Paraklesis. How bad did I mess up?,lyeth,1607114137,"^Silly ^question, ^but ^it's ^a ^slow ^Friday ^at ^work

Like many here, I'm a current deciphering Catholic catechumen and am going through the journey of questioning whether Catholicism is really where I'm supposed to be.

There's a local Greek Orthodox church just down the road from me that I decided to attend the other night during a Paraklesis ceremony. It was a beautiful first experience in an Orthodox church and I loved all of the singing and actual tradition I thirst for in the Catholic church.

That said, I immediately felt out of my element (rightfully so) and wasn't educated on what to do during the service. I was caught off guard because I was the only attendee at the start of it and I had no one to mimic. So, I went for a spot and noticed they had kneelers, and so, knelt. Halfway through, I didn't realize more people had come in and were standing behind me (no one in front to get the cue from that I was outing myself as a Catholic, no doubt). After realizing that no one else was kneeling, I felt embarrassed and like it may have been offensive in some formal way (even though no one reacted that way to me). So, how bad did I mess up kneeling through the whole thing? haha!

I'm taking it seriously enough that I've done a little research and now realizing that kneeling isn't as common in Orthodoxy. But, I'll make sure to sit further back next time and not kneel as a default again. Also, I'm mostly laughing at myself for it, but please let me know if it would've been a comedic thing or more offensive act for you if you saw my naivete that clearly displayed during a Paraklesis.",OrthodoxChristianity

Priest told me not to veil,chaos_is_silent,1607090090,"

My spiritual father recently had a conversation with me about headcovering at church. I'll be honest (though I'm slightly embarrassed), when I was little I used to want to convert to Islam for no other reason than because I'd be able to veil. So my spiritual father encouraged me to try it, and he agrees theologically that it is a good thing to do. Plus when I see icons of the Theotokos, or other women saints, I long to be able to cover as they did. It helps me feel safe, and secure too. I don't know why, but I do feel embarrassed about wanting to, when many are forced to or cannot truly choose freely. 

At the parish I visit when I can't attend usually, no one veils, but I decided to give it a try (I was very worried that I would seem as if I was trying to seems more pious than other women, which is definitely not the case! I'm sure the other women there are much more pious than I am, we each do what we can). So I wore a headcovering, with a more casual dress so that it wasn't a holier than thou sort of look. 

Afterwards, the priest spoke to me, and mentioned that I shouldn't cover if the other women don't do it (he was very gentle, and I appreciate his kindness, he explained much more than this and quite well too, don't get me wrong). But that it meant I was drawing attention to myself, and could be doing it for vanity, and that we should each do what comes naturally for us. I feel guilty for not having asked beforehand if it would be okay at his parish. But theologically I feel it's important (for myself) to wear headcovering if I'm to be in Church at a public prayer service (of course this is not a statement on what I think other women should do. They should do what is good for their relationship with God, and work with their spiritual father). 

If you were in my position, would you stop attending at that parish, or simply not cover there?

I don't want to bother my spiritual father about it right now, as it feels like an embarrassing issue to have, but will definitely ask as soon as I can get over myself, and is practical!",OrthodoxChristianity

Married bishops are in accordance with the general teaching of Orthodox canon law.”

That last sentence caught my attention and is something I’ve never heard before. Is this actually the case? And if so, why don’t we have any married Bishops? It’s an interesting idea. We seem to have a shortage, at least in the Antiochian Archdiocese in American. Where I am our Bishop was raised to Metropolitan 6 years ago and we still haven’t gotten a new Bishop. Seems like if it’s not against canon law, opening the Bishopric to married clergy might help full some of the void?

I've been raised Christian Orthodox and I always were very spiritual even as a kid. I remember I took my faith very seriously but as I started growing up I lost my faith.

Not only orthodoxy but all ritualistic religions seemed stupid. It doesn't make any sense. The whole liturgy is pointless. An all powerful God that needs priests and rituals that have to be done in a precise manner so that we can contact him or come in communion?

Praying itself is completely unnecessary if you think about it. If one has faith in God what could possibly one need in this earthly life? Why fear death, sickness, anything? True faith is invincible, why feel grief for dead relatives or friends? Why the whole mambo jumbo in funerals?

Why pray to heal from sickness? Why pray for recovery? We are going to God after all. 
Why is the church nessesary and the whole dogma if God is all powerful?

The whole structure of religion and any religion for that matter is just a mechanism for weak people to cope with life's daily problems. 

Had I have true faith in God my everyday would be pure happiness. I wouldn't desire anything but death. Death, as quick as I could get it just to witness the magnificence of the other world. All those things that the human mind cannot comprehend. Yet we see priests dressed in gold and diamonds claiming that is all symbolism and other bullshit. God doesn't need symbolism (specifically from gold and wealth) and neither do we.

Question about the history of Orthodox Christianity,My100thAcct,1606912927,"When researching sayings of the Ante Nicene Fathers (Theologians/Bishops before 325 AD), and researching the recorded history of the Church up until 1054 AD, I'm left not understanding how Orthodox considers itself rooted in the historical ""AnteNicene"" Church.  I came here to understand the Orthodox faith from a historical point of view, to learn things I haven't considered.

Do the Orthodox read the AnteNicene Fathers and consider them Orthodox, and not Catholic?  Are their ""Fathers"" I've never even heard of or considered known only among Orthodox circles.  Are there any good sites showing the specific roots and authority of Orthodox building up in the Ante Nicene period?

When it comes to infallible teaching of doctrine, Catholics heavily rely on the Papacy, the Apostolic See (of Rome), and the Magisterium.  This is rooted in a commonly phrased promise found in the Ante Nicene Fathers ""You are Peter, and on this Rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it"".   I remember there are many quotes of early Christians understanding this to mean the one holy Catholic Church (under the bishop of Rome).

I guess I'm asking, what historical facts could you tell me to clarify what Orthodox is more true over Catholicism?  If Catholics and Orthodox disagree on a major doctrine, by what authority are we appealing to for truth?

When Jesus promised to send His Holy Spirit to teach us all things, He promised it to all His Apostles, correct?  Isn't this where the Orthodox understand their infallible authority to teach comes from, but if the Church under Peter, is equal, and not supreme, then what happens when the Catholics and Orthodox disagree on doctrine, is therefore not infallible doctrine?",OrthodoxChristianity

I know his concern is about not having fights over kids' religion in the future. I love him a lot and I am okay with our future kids being brought up as Christian. When they are older, i also respect their decisions and choices on their own religion. I do not like to force my mind on others. I also would not force Buddhism on my BF or my kids.

"""and that on this account the Lord said, 'In my Father's house are many mansions'""",MarysDowry,1606882927,"""As the presbyters say, then those who are deemed worthy of an abode in heaven shall go there, others shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, and others shall possess the splendour of the city; for everywhere the Saviour will be seen, according as they shall be worthy who see Him. But that there is this distinction between the habitation of those who produce an hundred-fold, and that of those who produce sixty-fold, and that of those who produce thirty-fold; for the first will be taken up into the heavens, the second class will dwell in Paradise, and the last will inhabit the city; and that on this account the Lord said, ""In my Father's house are many mansions:"" for all things belong to God, who supplies all with a suitable dwelling-place, even as His word says, that a share is given to all by the Father, according as each one is or shall be worthy. And this is the couch in which they shall recline who feast, being invited to the wedding. The presbyters, the disciples of the apostles, say that this is the gradation and arrangement of those who are saved, and that they advance through steps of this nature; and that, moreover, they ascend through the Spirit to the Son, and through the Son to the Father; and that in due time the Son will yield up His work to the Father, even as it is said by the apostle, ""For He must reign till He hath put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."" For in the times of the kingdom the just man who is on the earth shall forget to die. ""But when He saith all things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted which did put all things under Him. And when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.""

Each time I open a thread I expect to see something in the comments as toxic or vitriolic as elsewhere on the web, and I seldom do. I really am surprised how many mature believers share honest and helpful opinions and advice. Of course there are exceptions but what makes me happy is that they are exceptions. 

I am a recent convert and to the coptic orthodox faith, and while there are things to be worked out ""above my pay-grade"" so to say, I am so happy to have this community to turn to in these times.

Also, some priests in podcasts or YouTube make very strong controversial statements that one could wonder: “do I have to agree with that to be orthodox?”

The answer, I believe is “Are these dogmas? Are they canon?” 

I’d love to hear some people chime in about some favorite or controversial dogmas and not-dogmas. Examples: the virgin birth is dogma and canon. Is the ever-virginity of Mary dogma/canon? (I think so.) Tollhouses: not-canon.

How did you choose Orthodoxy over Catholicism?,sevenrajas,1606793993,"I'm an inquirer into Orthodoxy who is struggling with my inability to solve the incomprehensible theological/historical web which determines the relative truth claims of Orthodoxy vs. Catholicism. 

I've dipped in and out of Christian churches for many years. Usually my interest would fade after no more than two weeks. Over the summer, I began revisiting Christianity, with a particular interest in Catholicism. I mostly just explored the interest through Scripture, YouTube, and talking with Catholic friends, though I went also to a couple masses - both NO and TLM.

A couple months ago, I discovered Orthodoxy via Solzhenitsyn and Tolstoy. In my first experience with liturgy I felt like I had been struck by God into acceptance of the Truth. It was an experience like nothing I've had before in either Catholic or Protestant churches. In the last few weeks, I've been to some twenty hours or so of prayers/liturgy/vespers, and talking with priests. 

I like the parish I've been attending very much. I do wonder about the possibility that I've ""chosen wrong"" between Catholicism and Orthodoxy, and what its implications are. However, I don't greatly desire running down the infinite rabbit hole of varying historical claims/interpretations of the primacy of Peter - I would rather just pray, worship, and learn how and what it means to be Orthodox.

Question for Greek Orthodox Community (a bit embarassing),t2rowaway,1606781835,"Hello Everyone, this is a throwaway for the same reasons I'm not asking my priest this question. Its kind of embarassing, not in ""I'm embarassed to confess this"" way, but in a ""Asking the question itself comes with implications"" sort of way.

I specified the Greek Community because my question relates to a particular cultural Church tradition, that as far as I'm aware exists primarily in the Greek world (perhaps the antiochian as well, I'm not sure).

Both my spiritual father and my parish priest are aware of all of my familial connections, so even asking the question might get me into hot water, depending on the answer.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Is a relationship allowed between a person and the sibling of a godchild of the person's parent? To explain what I mean, Person A's parent baptised Person B as a child. In the Greek tradition, this makes the parents ""Koumbari"" of each other, effectively bringing the families closer. But later down the track, Person A maybe, sort of, kinda, likes one of the siblings of Person B that we will label Person C.

I've always understood that if one is baptised by someone, then the children of the godparent are according to the Church, your brothers and sisters, but in my example, Person A doesn't really have that connection with Person C.

So is a relationship between Person A and Person C completely out of the question? Is it maybe allowed but deeply frowned upon? If you are confused by reading this, don't worry, I'm pretty confused myself which is honestly why I'm asking this here, despite it being so blatantly a ""ask your priest"" kind of thing.

Is spiritual direction possible for a heterodox seeker?,prayerseeker,1606757724,"The TL;DR of my post is the title, but I wanted to provide some more context. Basically I'm wondering if it is acceptable for an Orthodox priest or monk to provide spiritual direction to one of the heterodox regarding interior prayer.

I grew up in an evangelical protestant community but became disillusioned with it for many reasons and don't consider that a spiritual home for me anymore. Several months ago I learned of apophatic prayer for the first time when I started studying the Desert Fathers and then read a book called The Cloud of Unknowing. Something in me was profoundly drawn to this idea of simply sitting silently before God and putting my intent towards Him and doing nothing else. I prayed like this every day for a few weeks and my yearning just grew.

I prayed to God that He would show me more of this type of prayer, and one morning I became very aware of my sin and I was intensely afraid because of my sin before God, like fear to the point of losing my mind. The prayer ""Lord Jesus, have mercy on me, a sinner"" just came to me and I began to pray it over and over like my life depended on it. It was like nothing existed of me but the part of me that prayed that prayer, and then something happened that I cannot explain with words, and then I could do nothing but weep because of how beautiful and wonderful and merciful the salvation of Jesus Christ is. I just wept and wept.

The rest of that day was very intense. I prayed the prayer continuously and my mind was opened to many truths. I don't claim a special revelation, it was basically just the gospel truths from from scripture that all Christians would attest to, but it was pouring through my mind and I understood it all like I never have before. Jesus Christ truly is the Word and He became flesh and He lived among us, and His love for us cannot even be described with words, and there is nothing that can separate us from Him and He will return for us and salvation belongs to Him. These things poured through my mind like a river for hours. I wept a lot, it was both beautiful and intense.

In the course of all of that it came to me that I should look into something called ""hesychasm"", and so I have been studying that along with a modern teaching of The Cloud of Unknowing called ""centering prayer"", but I am more drawn to the Jesus prayer because you cannot pray centering prayer without ceasing, and after that day I desire to pray without ceasing as much as I can. But I have found both to be beneficial to my prayer life because centering prayer helped me to learn to let go of all thoughts and images as I pray.

I have also been reading the Philokalia and the Way of a Pilgrim, and I have been quite astonished at how my experience aligns with these teachings. Growing up in the evangelical world I had never heard of anything like this, and now I learn this is a spiritual practice many centuries old.

Among other things, the call to have spiritual direction in the Philokalia has really stuck out to me. I am afraid of falling into spiritual delusion and pride and being unaware of it. I even question myself and the experience I have already had, and have been trying to ignore any and all sensory experiences during prayer for this is recommended both in the Philokalia and by the teachers of centering prayer as the best method for avoiding delusion. But someone who was deluded would not know they were deluded or else they would not be deluded. So there is no way out of that without external direction from someone experienced in these things.

Two things hinder me here. I am quarantined for duration of the pandemic since my wife gets exposed working at the hospital and many of her coworkers have gotten sick over these months, some dreadfully so, and my conscience won't allow me to risk carrying this disease into a church or to a spiritual director, especially since he would likely be older. It is getting worse week by week here and my wife and her coworkers are constantly exposed so I could be an asymptomatic spreader at any point. Praise God for the fruits of prayer though; I am not anxious and afraid like I was during the first big surge and peace helps much with prayer.

There is also the fact that I am heterodox, and I'm not sure in my conscience yet about converting to orthodoxy although I am not opposed to it. It's just a huge change and my wife is very unsure of it (she also grew up evangelical protestant and isn't as disillusioned with them as I am). But like I said before I am afraid of spiritual delusion and yet there is no way I can stop seeking God in prayer after what I experienced, for the very purpose of existence is to seek God and offer our whole selves to Him in love and worship in response to His ineffable mercy and if I stopped doing that after what I experienced my conscience would rip me apart.

It is quite a conundrum I find myself in. Any advice or comments would be appreciated. Thanks and God bless!",OrthodoxChristianity

Monastery Icons and their Connection with a Synchronistic Yoga/Gnostic/Christian Organization,retrogamer_wv,1606709466,"The purpose of this post is to definitively establish the connection between Monastery Icons and a heretical group known as Light of the Spirit Monastery that advocates a synchronistic blend of “original yoga” and “original Christianity.” The TL;DR – if you don’t want your money going to a group that sells books that teach it is legitimate Christian practice to believe in reincarnation or that Christ spent all of the “lost years” not explicitly mentioned in the Bible in India for his spiritual growth, don’t buy from them. For the sake of full disclosure, I believe that icons are holy because of what they depict, not necessarily who made them. I certainly wouldn’t throw away an icon from Monastery Icons if I had one, but I definitely won’t be shopping from them, either. I just think people should be able to make informed choices as to whether they want to shop there.

Monastery Icons appears to have begun operations in 1981 according to the information found on Seraphim Weber’s LinkedIn page. Using the title “Father” Seraphim Weber, his name can still be found on the Monastery Icon website as recently as this year as the author of an article about Covid-19 not hindering them from delivering purchases: https://www.monasteryicons.com/product/saints-advice/. I am not sure if Monastery Icons is the company’s original name, but Mr. Weber lists his role as a General Manager with them from 1981 to present on the previously mentioned LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/father-seraphim-weber-00a68a33.

Thanks to Archive.org’s Wayback Machine, we can easily look at the previous versions of the Monastery Icon website. The earliest year the website has been catalogued is 1999, and it’s in these earlier years we find the information that connects Monastery Icons and Mr. Weber to a heretical group called Light of the Spirit Monastery that teaches a blend of religious yoga and Christianity that was founded by a gentleman named “Abbot” George Burke. Here is a link that will let you explore what is archived of the original capture of Monastery Icon’s site from 1999: http://web.archive.org/web/19990116230745/http://www.monasteryicons.com/. Remember that this is just a capture from January 16, 1999 that still has some functionality, but expect a good number of the links or images to be broken.

According to the 1999 version of Monastery Icon’s “About our Monastery” page (which you can click by finding on the previously provided link), you can find the following information: “THE LIGHT OF CHRIST MONASTERY (formerly Holy Protection Monastery) is a monastic foundation in the tradition of the Malayalam-speaking Malankara Orthodox (Syrian Jacobite) Church of South India. The Monastery is located a few miles outside the small desert town of Borrego Springs in southern California.” The main page also gives us this tidbit: “Last summer our Monastery relocated from Nebraska to the desert of southern California. Learn more about our new retreat at The Desert Fathers page.” It’s also important to note on this page we can find the full original address of Monastery Icons provided as 1482 Rango Way, Borrego Springs, CA.

A quick search for Holy Protection Monastery in Nebraska revealed the following archived article by a newspaper called The Oklahoman: https://oklahoman.com/article/2197005/monastery-files-lawsuit-in-bakery-dispute. The article lists the name of the organization who filed on behalf of the monastery as the “Gnostic Orthodox Church of Christ in America.” I have been unable to find any direct source with more information about The Light of Christ Monastery/Holy Protection Monastery, but I did find that the Gnostic Orthodox Church of Christ in America (the organization they were operating from) was registered on 5/15/1998 at 1482 Rango Way with the Californian Secretary of State, which is just a short window before the first time the Monastery Icon’s page listing that location was captured by the Wayback Machine in January of the next year: https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=02039206-4668990.

If you look at the filing paperwork for the Gnostic Orthodox Church just linked, you can confirm it was signed by a “Father” Seraphim Weber who lists his role as “Secretary-Treasurer” of the organization. In 2003, just a short five years later, paperwork is submitted with the state to change the name from “Gnostic Orthodox Church of Christ in America” to “Light of the Spirit Church Inc.”: https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=02039206-6283070. All information about the Light of Christ or Holy Protection monastery was removed from the Monastery Icons page around this same time, and a new organization called “Sacred Arts Foundation” was established in 2003 at the 1482 Rango Way address with John P. Weber as the filing officer of the organization. This same organization filed additional paperwork in 2005 listing both John P. Weber and William Burke as officers, and you can compare the signature on this paperwork to see that “Fr.” Seraphim’s legal first name  appears to be John (I’m unsure why he decided to switch): https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=02548555-11098290. 

Around this same time, Monastery Icon began listing the Sacred Arts Foundation as the name of the organization behind their business. If you look at Monastery Icon website’s today on the main page, you can find the following quote: “We are Sacred Arts Foundation, a non-profit ministry dedicated to strengthening faith and Christian devotion in churches, schools and home through our Monastery Icons collection of traditional Christian art and other beautiful sacred art and gifts since 1981.” At this point, we have Mr. Weber, Mr. Burke (who I will speak of in more detail in the following paragraphs), and the Gnostic Orthodox Church of Christ in America (now named the Light of the Spirit Church) definitively established as the people/organization behind the scenes of the Monastery Icons website.

So who is William (George) Burke, and what is the Light of the Spirit Church? Mr. Burke is a gentleman who has been at the helm of these religious organizations and the icon shop since they began. They have changed names quite a few times, as well as locations. The current monastery that is registered under Light of the Spirit Church is located in Cedar Crest, NM, which also happens to be where the Sacred Arts Foundation relocated to in 2009: https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=02548555-7374220.  If you visit the Light of the Spirit Monastery’s website, you can confirm that “Abbot” Burke is listed as the founder of this monastery and can read about him there: https://ocoy.org/author/abbot-george/.

This Light of the Spirit Monastery champions itself as teaching “Original Yoga and Original Christianity,” and you can take a look at some of their teachings on their main page: https://ocoy.org/.  They sell books written by Mr. Burke like The Christ of India: The Story of Original Christianity, a “historical” analysis of Christ’s life in which the author is arguing that Christ’s spirituality is derived from Indian spirituality. He bases a lot of his ideas on the premise that Christ was an Essene, which is a group Burke claims practiced Egyptian Mysteries (which he further states were derived from “Sanatana Dharma “ (a term that apparently is used for an umbrella for broader Hinduism). Additionally, he claims in this book that India is where Christ spent his life during the so-called “lost years” not documented in scripture to grow spiritually. Feel free to read about the book here: https://ocoy.org/original-christianity/the-christ-of-india/. 

As it stands in 2020, the only address listed on the Monastery Icons website is a PO Box in Ohio, and there is no information provided on their site about exactly who the Sacred Arts Foundation is. Apart from digging through the bowels of various state records to find that Mr. Burke was the chief officer behind the Sacred Arts Foundation and a self-described gnostic sect/synchronistic Yoga-Christian monastery, the unsuspecting buyer on Monastery Icons would have no idea that the profits made from these icons are funding his evangelism, organizations, and writings that are completely antithetical to the teachings of canonical Orthodoxy. I will reiterate that I do not believe any icons produced by them are somehow ‘not icons’ or ‘unholy,’ but I also think many Orthodox and Catholic shoppers would rather not indirectly fund Mr. Burke’s activities when there are plenty of legitimate businesses to purchase icons from. 

This was easily the most research I’ve ever done for an Internet post. It feels absolutely ridiculous, but it is something I’ve seen several folks over the almost two years I’ve been hear ask about from time to time. It seemed somewhat known that there were connections with ‘weird’ teachings, but after talking with another person on the sub earlier today, I did the research to provide receipts. I do not like the steps that Monastery Icons has gone to wipe any direct connection between Mr. Burke’s organizations and the shop. On their site, you can see that parishes will even contract them to install large icons in their sanctuaries. I have to seriously wonder if those parishes would still do business with them if they were more transparent about who founded the business and profits from it.",OrthodoxChristianity

This Sunday he went on a rant during his Homily about how that is heretical and denies the body and blood of Christ. 

He told us that if any of us went to that church and received communion, that he will not admit us to receive communion in our parish.

I know our Priest isn’t fond of many of the other local churches, especially the Greeks and OCA. Though is the first time I’ve seen him openly discouraging people from attending and receiving communion at other canonical churches.

Parents making me take communion and I seriously don't want to,SkinntyKeto,1606698257,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I hope nobody gets offended by what I have to say, that truly isn't my intent. I'm really frustrated by the situation I'm in so if my tone sounds harsh then it's only because I'm annoyed, not because I'm trying to insult anyone.

I grew up Greek Orthodox, but my family was never really strict about religion. My dad specifically rarely goes to church. He believes in God but church was never really his thing. My mom was always a little more interested in church but for the firs maybe 10-15 years of my life she was never so strict about it to the point where she would go to church every single Sunday or follow every fast or anything like that. Recently, however, she has been extremely invested in religion (in the past 5 years or so). Like literally every single Sunday she goes to church, she fasts every Wednesday, Friday, and any for any other religious holiday, and has been going to a specific monastery in a different state regularly just to pray there. It's reached a point where she thinks the coronavirus was brought here by the antichrist and she asked me not to get any vaccine that comes out because it would basically guarantee me a trip to hell (I know it might sound sort of crazy but it's true). I'm only saying all this to make the point that religion has become a BIG part of her life suddenly.

Earlier today she told me she wants me to take communion before Christmas. (Also, not sure if it's called communion in English, I grew up doing church in a different language so I don't know what the English words for any religious tradition. But the thing where a priest gives you a small amount of wine with holy bread.) We're Greek Orthodox so for us you have to do confession and fast at least 3 days before you're allowed to take communion (not sure if it works the same way for other denominations). My problem is that 1. fasting for me is incredibly difficult because I don't eat carbs so eating vegan and no carbs for 3 days is like really really hard and 2. I DON'T want to do confession. On the list of things I truly despise doing, confessing my ""sins"" to a priest is at the very bottom. It doesn't provide me any comfort or relief, I never feel better after doing it, I really feel uncomfortable telling a priest all the stupid things I've done in my life, I've done it like 3 times and each time was a pain for me. I feel way better forgiving myself for my mistakes, I don't need a priest to make me feel better. I really resonate with my dad with believing in God, but not particularly being attracted to church stuff. So I honestly don't know how to get out of this.

I could *technically* just tell my mom flat out that I don't want to, I'm 20 years old so she can't really force me. But my parents have literally done EVERYTHING for me so it's incredibly hard for me to say no to them when they ask me to do something. I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me on how to handle this situation? Or maybe any advice on how to tell my mom that this just isn't my thing.

Girlfriend does not want to abstain from sex,Training-Double701,1606682021,"Warning this is a long post, but I have turned to you all for help, I am getting desperate:

I am a recent covert to Orthodoxy (Carpatho-Russian Dioceses) from the Methodist church and I have been having a particular issue with my girlfriend of close to a year, she does NOT want to abstain from sex. When we first got together, we had been friends for close to a year and were already much in love when we first had sex a couple weeks into dating. At that point I was not Orthdox and quite honeslty wasn't a practicing Christian, though I believed. Therefore, I placed little thought behind the sinfulness of sex as long as it was not just causal sex, but with someone I loved and hoped to marry. For background, she is Jewish, Chabad-Lubavitch to be exact. She is practicing, though she picks and chooses what she follows in terms of religious law. As she puts it, ""I never claimed to be a good Jew, I just try"" but I digress. She is conservative in politics and values, which I love. We have made plenty of compromises, such as agreeing to be married in the future in both a Church and synagogue, as well as ""splitting"" our children in terms of religion (i.e. 2 children means one is raised Jewish and one raised Orthodox). But when it comes to sex, she does not want to budge. She says that she has a high libido and requires her ""needs"" to be met. She also says that most importantly that she places a high value on sex and that it is a very intimate way for her to love me. She also says that she has come to terms with it being a sin in Judaism with the whole ""I never said I'm a good Jew"" line. I've begged and pleaded with her about it and tried to get to her see my reasoning, but she won't have it. I've bargained my way to no sex on Sundays and not on important religious days, though she still is obviously unhappy with this. This isn't to say she neglects all my religious needs, as she cooks for us both (like I said, a very traditional girl) and she is currently making Nativity Fast compliant meals for us without complaint. 

We are both in university and will be separated from early December until mid January. I have told her that after we separate for winter break that I want to try abstain completely. She has conceded but is very frustrated and constantly brings up how it will ""never work"". I have spoken to my priest on this issue and he really couldn't give me any advice further than to talk with her and find a solution that works and to most importantly pray for assistance. 

As I told her, I quite frankly enjoy sex as much as she does, but I also recognize that it is sinful and live with guilt. She simply does not understand this and feels that I am placing needless obstacles into our very happy relationship. As I said before, we plan to marry (to her its only a formality, to her there is no one else, her words) but it cannot be for atleast a year and half for various reasons. Mostly financial. 

I do not know what to do here and it is torturing me. I love this woman with all my heart and wish to marry her, but this issue of sex is seemingly driving us apart. What can I do in this situation? Has anyone experienced a similar issue?

I believe it's best to 'steel man' your opponent's position. I have been earnestly trying to understand the other side, rather than appealing to ad hominems or authority fallacies.   


From what I gather, there are two broad anti-mask claims:  


1. **Masks will become a new normal, even after COVID-19.** Once everyone gets used to wearing a mask during COVID-19, they will be afraid to remove masks after the pandemic is over. I do see this as a valid pro-mask claim, though I'm not sure how serious it is. 
2. **Masks are pagan, and don't belong in the Church**. I mean, I get this, since masks were used in ancient pagan sexual rites, but I don't see how wearing them for medical protection is pagan.

Hi everyone,

I hope you guys can help me.

I’m not Christian, but I’ve been studying Orthodoxy for the last year, and decided to convert recently. 

I have a Greek Orthodox Church and a Russian Orthodox Church (England. UK), both at the same distance from home. I attended several Divine Liturgies in the Russian Orthodox Church.

My initial preference was the Russian congregation, but after attending several times, and most people ignoring myself and my wife (either before or after the liturgy) I felt a bit disappointed. The priest was friendly but after requesting some information via email, he didn’t reply back. 

On the other hand, I am member of a group in Social Media of members of the Greek congregation, and they seem more friendly an open. 

My issue is that I am a bit concerned though about certain things of the Greek Orthodox Church. This specific church is linked to Bishop Kallistos. His declarations about Homosexuality and Same Sex Marriage concerns me, also his comments on Female Ordination. The constant disagreement between the Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches (Personally I position myself with the Russian Orthodox Church) made me feel like if I join the Greek Orthodox Church, at some point, this church will close ties with Roman Catholics, and separate from other Orthodox Churches, turning into something similar to the Anglican Church.

My question is for either members of the Greek or Russian Orthodox Church. Is this something likely to happen?

If so, should I keep attending in the Russian congregation? 

I want to clarify that I have nothing against Homosexuals. It is more that I believe that the Orthodox Church hasn’t changed in the last 2000 years, and this is one of the reasons why I want to join.

Here in England this second lock down really affected me mentally, I’m feeling extremely anxious for this reason and I will appreciate any help.",OrthodoxChristianity

When I pray the Roman Catholic Rosary, and meditate on faith, hope, and love, and hold in my mind's eye images from the life of Christ, there is peace and joy. I surrender myself to God's will, and am filled with hope and trust. 

When I pray the Jesus prayer I am filled with soul crushing despair. I don't know what to do. I've exhausted myself with prayers and prostrations and have heard voices and seen shadowy figures. All the spiritual reading says to pray the Jesus prayer.  A spirit came to me and told me to pray the rosary and another spirit told me to join the Catholic Church. My Orthodox priest told me it was a demon, but now I just feel depressed and suicidal. I can't make sense of what to believe. What is a deception and what's from God?

Orthodoxy is the true faith I'm sure. From studying history, the desert fathers, monastic life to the current church today. 

Yet faith needs time to grow and until now things have been rocky or should I say sandy? God has taught me a lot lately through my own stumbling.  Mainly about pride, humility and the absolute need for His love. 


Please pray for me.  I'm joining the team so very late in the game.  Pray that God helps me in my journey to baptism and maybe even beyond.  I would very much like for God to use my knowledge and skills for his Kingdom. We all seek to be like Christ.  God willing I would love to become a priest one day to help cast out demons and heal.

I understand that abortion is a sin, but why isn’t Orthodoxy more open about it?

My question: do you Orthodox actually praise Mary and the saints, like you would to God, and ask them to do things, rather than God.

Please may you (you who I am praying to be the one to) lead me in righteousness.” Do you Orthodox do this also?

Binary damnation and the divine presence model of hell,MarysDowry,1606311710,"You all know my views on hell, but I have a genuine question concerning the typical Orthodox understanding of hell.

My question is essentially, how does the imagery of binary, saved vs unsaved, damnation in the NT fit with the divine presence model of hell, that is, that a soul experiences torment or pleasure relative to their personal alignment with Gods goodness. A soul that is unaligned with good will feel torment to varying degrees, whilst a soul that is aligned and purified will feel pleasure.

The question I have comes to the issue of how this gradient of experience translates into the binary. If the pains of hell were gradated based on a souls qualities, we would have souls ranging anywhere on the scale from pure evil, to near-perfection purification. I can only imagine that there would be countless souls sitting around the halfway point, where they are not terribly evil, but also not terribly good. 

Now say we have many people in this halfway point, where they truly desire good but are also very imperfect, what will their experience be? 

I don't see how the binary seperation of goats and sheep fits with a gradated model based on a souls experience. I'll give an example, say we were taking a test and the fail level was 50%, you got 49% and I got 50%, I would technically have passed, and you have failed, but our scores would be so close together that the actual difference in our performance would be neglible, essentially indistinguishable from random variation. 

So thinking of hell, how do the saved and unsaved get seperated if its based on personal internal experience? Whats the cut-off point for someones experience being pleasant enough to be 'saved'? 

Is it possible for someone to be good enough that their damnation is barely distinguishable from a person who just escaped damnation, akin to the 49% vs 50% example, and if so, what is the actual difference between damnation and salvation?

I struggle to see how a gradated 'salvation' based on personal alignment and purification can be split into this binary of saved vs unsaved. Unless we are to say that theres no middleground, I think experientally this is quite obviously (to me) wrong though. Take for example a doctor who spends their life saving people and volunteers regularly in charitable works, but who sins regularly in the flesh and neglects church attendance. To me, I don't see how if we are measuring based on the souls openess to God, we could say that this person is either closed off to God or open. Like most people theres a mixture of a true desire for good and a mistaken identification of evils as goods. 

The actual NT depiction of these issues seems to be far more legalistic, that we are explicitly judged based on our behaviours and that based on this there is a seperation of people, that its not from some internal experiental grading, but from an external classification (often to the displeasure of those who wanted to enter) as we are told in various parables.",OrthodoxChristianity

A few questions regarding prayer ropes,NorthernSkagosi,1606299835,"Hello. As the title suggest, I have some questions regarding prayer ropes:

1. Is the laity allowed to use prayer ropes to pray? Is the laity allowed to tie them? 
2. This question is sillier and needs some background context, so I beg of you not to judge me too harshly. There is this girl that I like, and she is not Orthodox (baptised Roman Catholic, currently agnostic), so as I was watching a youtube tutorial on how to make a prayer rope, I thought ""hm, I could make one for her and give it to her for Christmas"". I know it is not a frivolous accessory, and she is not the kind of person who wears accessories, so I am fairly certain that she will not wear it as a mere bracelet or use it as decoration. And, though this may be delusional and far-fetched, part of me hopes that she will convert. Another part of me though, simply wants to impress her by showing her that I have some skill in handicrafts (handicrafts being a major hobby of hers and something she is really good at). And this is where my doubts come in as to whether I should do this, because the latter motivation is quite self-centred and by definition, not very Christian.

A question about communion with Rome,DearLeader420,1606275757,"Hello /r/OrthodoxChristianity ! (TL;DR at bottom)

I'm a lifelong Protestant exploring the Catholic and Orthodox faiths, and I had a question about communion with Rome that I haven't really seen a good answer to.

I'm familiar with the (very convincing) Orthodox arguments against Papal Supremacy. But the Church Fathers also seem to attest that communion with Rome is essential to the catholic, Christian faith. Obviously, Rome and the Eastern churches do not share communion. What are your opinions, as Orthodox Christians, on these writings from the Fathers (emphasis added):

&gt;""...by pointing out here the successions of the bishops of the **greatest and most ancient church** known to all, founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, that church which has the tradition and the faith which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the apostles. **With that church, because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree**, that is, **all the faithful in the whole world**, and it is **in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition**.""  Irenaeus, *Against Heresies*

-

&gt;""On him [Peter] he builds the Church, and to him he gives the command to feed the sheep [John 21:17], and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, **yet he founded a single chair [cathedra]**, and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity. Indeed, the others were also what Peter was [i.e., apostles], but a primacy is given to Peter, whereby it is made clear that there is but one Church and one chair. So too, all [the apostles] are shepherds, and the flock is shown to be one, fed by all the apostles in single-minded accord. **If someone does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he imagine that he still holds the faith? If he [should] desert the chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built, can he still be confident that he is in the Church?**""  Cyprian of Carthage, *The Unity of the Catholic Church*

-

&gt;""You wrote … that I should forward a copy of the same letter to our colleague [Pope] Cornelius, so that, laying aside all anxiety, he might at once know that you held communion **with him, that is, with the Catholic Church**.""  Cyprian of Carthage, *Letters*

-

&gt;“You cannot deny that you are aware that in the city of Rome the episcopal chair was given first to Peter; the chair in which Peter sat, the same who was head—that is why he is also called Cephas [‘Rock’]—of all the apostles; **the one chair in which unity is maintained by all**.""  Optatus, *The Schism of the Donatists*

-

&gt;""I follow no leader but Christ and **join in communion with none but your blessedness** [Pope Damasus I], that is, with the chair of Peter. I know that this is the rock on which the Church has been built. Whoever eats the Lamb outside **this house** is profane. Anyone who is not in the ark of Noah will perish when the flood prevails.""  Jerome, *Letters*

-

&gt;""We exhort you in every respect, honorable brother, to heed obediently what has been written by the most blessed pope of the city of Rome, for blessed Peter, who lives and presides in his own see, **provides the truth of faith to those who seek it**. For we, by reason of our pursuit of peace and faith, **cannot try cases on the faith without the consent of the bishop of Rome**.""  Peter Chrysologus, *Letters*

-

And these last two are technically about Papal Supremacy, but since one is from John Chrysostom himself, and the other from an Ecumenical Council, I am very interested in the Orthodox response:

&gt;""He entrusts him with the rule [prostasia] over the brethren. . . . If anyone should say ‘Why then was it James who received the See of Jerusalem?’, I should reply that He made Peter the teacher not of that see **but of the whole world**.""""

-

&gt;""Philip, presbyter and legate of [Pope Celestine I] said: ‘We offer our thanks to the holy and venerable synod, that when the writings of our holy and blessed pope had been read to you . . . you joined yourselves to the holy head also by your holy acclamations. For your blessednesses is not ignorant that the **head of the whole faith**, the head of the apostles, is blessed Peter the apostle.""

-

**TL;DR: A multitude of the Church Fathers seem to attest that communion with Rome is essential to the Apostolic Faith. Even if the Orthodox Church believes the Pope is not Supreme (per Vatican I and other actions), why doesn't being out of communion with Rome invalidate the faith of the Orthodox Church?**

Communion in the Pre-Sanctified Liturgy?,AltOfReddit,1606264355,"Lent is months away, and so this is an odd time to ask this, but I happened to be reading something about the Liturgy of Pre-Sanctified Gifts yesterday, and I learned that there is (was?) controversy over whether or not the wine which is poured into the chalice and which the Lamb is placed into becomes the Blood of Christ, as only the Body is preserved from the previous Sunday Liturgy and there is no prayer of consecration in the PSL.

I read that the earlier opinion and the one still held by the Greeks/Antiochians is that the wine becomes the Blood through contact with the Body, and that the Russian Church sees it as regular wine.

I would have follow-up questions for both opinions.
If the former, does that mean that other times that the Gifts come in contact with unconsecrated bread and wine that they become the Eucharist? If the latter, why even have wine in the PSL at all?",OrthodoxChristianity

Marrying outside the faith,TitillatingTittyLady,1606253994,"(sorry if there's errors or typos or weird formatting, on mobile) 

Need some advice.

I am 22f, born and raised Orthodox Christian. I have had a boyfriend now for a year and a half, we were living together the first year together and the past 4 months have been living with my parents since his family wouldn't take us both in and we didn't want to be separated.

He is not religious, he isn't against religion, always been super respectful of me being Greek Orthodox, just doesn't follow or practice it himself and I'm okay with that! My parents, especially my mom, keeps bringing up how of we were to marry he needs to be baptized, even if he doesn't want to be Orthodox, he can be Christian baptized. 

I've expressed that he may never be baptized and I love him and I'll never force him. She agrees he seems to be ""the one"", my whole family loves him and they see how in love we are. And I've mentioned that marriage isn't an idea right now, especially not with covid, he and I are moving into an apartment of our own in two weeks and she said ""I just want to know if you're going to start making steps towards a future together or are you just playing house?""

I don't know what to say or do because I love this man and I plan on continuing our relationship and we've discussed it and we do want to marry but just not anytime soon. I am willing to have a weddi g outside the church so I can be with him, whereas my parents seem to find that to be a deal breaker for them but it's MY relationship.

On top of this, I am only 22, my sister got married at 21, in the church, and it ended in abuse and divorce. My two brothers are in their early 30s, one hasn't dated in 10 years, the other has a girlfriend who's Hindu. Why is all this marriage pressure on me when I am so young and have older siblings. Why can't I be with the person I love even though they respect my faith, just because they don't follow our faith? 

Why do I feel so forcefully guided and restricted? I don't want to upset or disrespect my parents and I love my faith, but neither are going to keep me from the man I love. Last time I focused on faith as a key part of a relationship it lasted for 10 months and was riddled with verbal, sexual and physical abuse and ended in a restraining order as he was stalking me for months. Not saying it was because of the faith, but I feel focusing on having that as a part of the relationship had blinded me to all the red flags. I currently feel more respect from my boyfriend who never knew the faith than to a man who's whole family and personal identity was strong in the faith.

"Once, a man who was ill lost his patience and cried out to the Lord..",radonezh,1606172943,"Once, a man who was ill lost his patience and cried out to the Lord asking to be relieved from his terrible pains. An Angel then appeared and told him: 

""The All-Merciful God had heard your prayer and will gran your petition, but under one condition. Instead of one year with torments on earth by which every man is cleansed from sin like gold in fire, you will agree to spend three hours in hell. Because your soul needs to be cleansed with the trials of illness, normally you would have to endure sickness for another year. Since this seems difficult for you, think of what hell means where all sinners go. For this reason try it if you wish for three hours only, and then with the prayers of the Holy Church you will be saved.""

The sick man thought, ""One year of torments on earth is a very long time. It is better to be patient for three hours in hell."" he told the angel.

The angel then gently took the man's soul in his hands, left it in hell, and withdrew saying, ""I will return in three hours.""

The ever-lasting darkness which reigned, the oppression, the cries of the damned which reached his ears, and their wild appearance all created terrible fear and sorrow in the unfortunate man. He beheld and heard torments everywhere. In this immense abyss of hell there was no sound of joy to be heard. Only the fiery eyes of demons could be seen in the darkness, waiting to tear him apart.

The wretched man began to tremble and cry aloud, but only the abyss answered his cries and screams. It seemed to him that entire ages of torments had passed, and while he expected the angel to come at any moment, this did not happen.

Finally, despairing that he would not see Paradise, he began to moan and cry; but no one cared. The sinners in hell only thought about themselves, and the demons rejoiced in their torments. But behold, the sweet radiance of the angel appeared in the abyss. 

With an angelic smile he stood over the tormented man and asked him, ""So, how are you faring, O man?""

""I would not believe that there could be deceit even among angels,"" the tormented man whispered.

""What do you mean by that?"" asked the angel.

""What do you mean by what do I mean?"" continued the torments man. ""You promised that you would take me from here in three hours, and since then years, rather whole centuries have passed with unbearable torments.""

""Blessed man, what years? What ages?"" the surprised angel said. ""Only one hour has passed since I left, and you must stay here another two hours.""

""What? Two hours? Oh, I cannot bear it. I do not have the strength. If it is possible and if it is the will of God, I beseech you, take me from here. It would be better to suffer for years on earth until the Day of Judgement; just take me out of Hell. Have pity on me"" the tormented man cried out, raising his hands to the angel. 

""Very well"" replied the angel. ""The Good God as Loving Father will have mercy on you""

With these words he opened his eyes and saw that, as before, he was in his bed of illness.

I've attended divine liturgy for months but there are some things that I've been struggling with. Maybe you guys could give me a different perspective on the church. 

I know that role of the emperor was critical, after the edict of Milan, in the development of Christian orthodoxy. It was the emperor who would call ecumenical councils to form consensus between the bishops and unify christendom. It seems that after the fall of the Eastern empire, the Orthodox Church has yet to see this figure replaced. 

It's been over 1000 years since a council has been held and Patriarchs refuse to work together over fights over jurisdiction and authority. Where is this figure to exercise authority and unity? I know that these things don't affect a persons relationship with the saints and God, but for a church that claims to be the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church of God, it's worrying. 

I find it even more worrying that the Church of God remains inaccessible to the majority of the world. It makes me sad to think that the Roman Catholic church, despite it's heresy, has been able to make itself accessible to the world while exerting unity among it's ranks.

Help talking with parents and leaving college,Double_Courage_7768,1606077125,"After much time I have finally decided to ask for advice here. I am currently a student at Pensacola Christian College, a college with an Independent Fundamental Baptist affiliation. I have for a long time been curious about Orthodoxy, and while I was in quarantine I started researching why the Deuterocanon was removed by the protestants. Me being a history major found that the Deuterocanon was wrongfully removed but also that the early church held many different views that I was not aware of. I now reject the concept of the rapture, and I have for many years questioned the grace alone doctrine. I now desire to join the Eastern Orthodox Church as I now see it is the most Biblically and historically accurate form of Christianity. The problem I am facing is the culture of this college I am attending is very anti-Catholic and  by extension most other denominations. I have been heavily criticized for stating I do not believe in the rapture and for defending Orthodoxy and Catholicism from the people who state that you worship Mary. You are required to attend the church on campus or you will get demerits. Many people here also believe that Jesus did not turn water to wine. Men and women are not allowed physical contact including hand holding and kissing, as a result of this I have come to believe that some men on campus have turned to homosexuality. My parents specifically are Southern Baptists. My mother in particular has wanted me to attend this college for several years and is completely engrossed by it. My only sibling announced last year that he was bisexual. This has caused my mother to act like he has completely abandoned God, even though he still states to be a Christian(albeit a more liberal form). She now acts like any issues I have with this place is caused by my brother who did not want me to attend this college. I go home for Thanksgiving this Wednesday, and would like to tell my father and then my mother about my desire to convert to Orthodoxy and to repeat to them that I do not want to attend this college anymore. I really do not want to cause my mother any grief or distress. Prayers and advice on how to speak to them about this subject will be much appreciated.

My question for you is, is Rolt's characterization of the distinction between God's Ultimate Reality (the Super-essential Essence) and His Eternal Manifested Appearance identical (or similar enough to) the Orthodox teaching on Essence-Energies? Or am I missing a subtle difference? My apologies for the long quote... 

&gt;The basis of \[Dionysius'\] teaching is the doctrine or the Super-Essential Godhead (ὑπερούσιος θεαρχία). We must, therefore, at the very outset ﬁx the meaning of this term. Now the word “ Essence or “Being” (οὐσία) means almost invariably an individual existence, more especially a person, since such is the highest type that individual existence can in this world assume. And, in fact, like the English word “Being,” it may without qualiﬁcation be used to mean an angel. Since, then, the highest connotation of the term “Essence” or “Being” is a person, it follows that by “ Super—Essence ” is intended “Supra-Personality.” And hence the doctrine of the Super-Essential Godhead simply means that God is, in His ultimate Nature, Supra-Personal...He is not one Being among others, but in His ultimate nature dwells on a plane where there is nothing whatever beside Himself...  
&gt;  
&gt;...Ultimately the Godhead is undifferentiated and unrelated, but in Its eternal created activity It is manifested under the form of Differentiation and Relationship. It belongs concurrently to two worlds: that of Ultimate Reality and that of Manifested Appearance. Hence, therefore, the possibility not only of Creation but also Revelation (ἔκφανσις). Just as the Godhead creates all things by virtue of that Aspect of Its Nature which is (as it were) turned towards them, so It is revealed to us by virtue of the same Aspect turned towards our minds which form part of the creation. Hence all the Scriptural Names of God, and this very Name “God” itself, though they apply to the whole Nature of the Godhead and not merely to some particular element or function thereof, yet cannot express that Nature in Its Ultimate Super-essence but only as manifested in Its relative activity. Dionysius, in fact, deﬁnitely teaches that doctrine which, when revived independently of recent years by Dr. Bradley was regarded as a startling blasphemy: that God is but an Appearance of the Absolute. And this is, after all, merely a bold way of stating the orthodox truism that the Ultimate Godhead is incomprehensible: a truism which Theology accepts as an axiom and then is prone to ignore. The various Names of God are thus mere inadequate symbols of That Which transcends all thought and existence. But they are undifferentiated titles because they are symbols which seek (though unsuccessfully) to express the undifferentiated Super-Essence. Though the terms “God,” “King,” “Good,” “Existent,” etc., have all different connotations, yet they all denote the same undifferentiated Deity.   
&gt;  
&gt;There are, however, some Names which denote not the undifferentiated Godhead, but certain eternally differentiated Elements in Its Manifestation. These are the Names of the Three Persons in the Blessed Trinity. Whereas the terms “God,” “King,” “Good,” “Existent,” etc., denote (though they cannot express it) the same Reality: the term “Father” denotes something different from that of “Son,” and both of these from that of “ Holy Ghost.” The whole Manifested Godhead is “God,” “King,” “Creator,” “Saviour,” “Lord,” “Eternal,” “Living,” etc., but only One Persona of the Godhead is Father, or Son, or Holy Ghost. The undifferentiated titles differ from each other merely through our feeble grasp of the Manifestation, and coalesce as our apprehension of it grows; the differentiated titles (διακεκριμένα or διακρίσεις) represent actual distinctions in the eternal Manifestation Itself. Thus the Absolute Godhead is the Super-Essence; the eternally Manifested Godhead is the Trinity.   
&gt;  
&gt;As to the reasons of this Dionysius deprecates all inquiry. He does not, for instance, suggest that Relationship in this its simplest form cannot but exist within that side of the Godhead which embraces and enters into this relative world. Here, as elsewhere, his purpose in spite of his philosophical language, is in the deepest sense, purely practical, and mere speculations are left on one side. He accepts the Eternal Distinctions of the Trinity because They have been revealed; on the other hand, he sees that they must belong to the sphere of Manifestation or They could not be revealed...  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus while in the Undifferentiated Godhead the “Persons” of the Trinity ultimately transcend Themselves and point (as it were) to a region where They are merged, yet in that side of Its Nature which looks towards the universe They shine eternally forth and are the effulgence of those “Supernal Rays” through Which. all light is given us, and whence all energy streams into the act of creation. For by Their interaction They circulate that Super-Essence which Each of Them perfectly possesses, and so It passes forth from Them into a universe of Being.",OrthodoxChristianity

Want to go to church - Mold Allergy,shtfbunny2020,1606049445,"Hi all,

I want to get some perspective from some of you on what the best route is to go.  I have a very severe mold allergy and was hoping to begin attending the Orthodox Church locally.  When I went in, I had a reaction nearly immediately within the small church.  I don't know what to do if I can't actually be in the building but want to attend... I'm feeling pretty upset about it, tbh.  What would you all recommend? Online services?  This is obviously not being rectified anytime soon.  My environmental allergies are my own thing to deal with and it's a very old and small church in a maritime area so expecting the church to fix it is certainly not an option. I had already required a mask exemption for my visit. I feel embarrassed to go speak to the priest and say that's why or expect special treatment for it and look like the person who always needs special treatment.  I want to be catechized and join but I'm worried my health is actually going to hold me back.    

Any advice?  What do I do?

FWIW - I react to spores even if there isn't a huge visible mold source.  It wouldn't be a ""oh look, there's the mold over there thing..."" unfortunately.",OrthodoxChristianity

Argument for Jesus Resurrection,themistery716J,1606030072,"For fellow believers to strengthen faith in the risen Christ from an apologetics point of view.

The argument for the ressurection  is mounted, please read all., my stance is that Jesus did indeed rise from the dead and I’ll give my arguments for this proposition... 

The disciples claim they had experiences of meeting the risen Christ with full conviction..... the disciples definitely **believed** they seen and touched the risen Christ.... even Bart Ehrman who is an atheist-agnostic quotes...... *""I dont doubt at all that some disciples claimed this,... Paul, writing about twenty five years later, indicates that this is what they claimed, and i don't think he is making it up. The new Testament: A Historical Introduction to the early Christian Writings Page 301*

and another christian scholar quotes *""It is an equally secure fact that the disiples of Jesus saw him (in what sense is not certain) after his death...... thereafter his followers saw him. The Historical Figure of Jesus Page 13*

The reason for this is many attestations, such as Paul's Epistles, Mark, John, Matthew, Luke and Acts, and even Josephus,

And there is no way to explain the rise of Christianity if this didn't happen, **something** had to happen which compelled the disciples of Jesus to begin preaching this..

So.. the disciples claimed they seen and touched the Risen Christ...... but i'm sure you would say why take their claims seriously? ......

When testimonies are unreliable is when the event happens quickly coz its hard to retain memory of the event... (the disciples of Jesus report Jesus eating and drinking with them and with them for a long period of time and even engaging in conversation with them , Acts10:41, Luke 24:26-49, John 21:1-4)... when someone is really expecting it such as people actually looking for big-foot or aliens ufos or if they are stranded and actually look for any near helicopters and start tricking their minds into seeing such things .. (the disciples were never expecting a dying messiah as the messiah would live forever, and never expecting a dying and rising God, this is so foreign to them, when their messiah died, it was like end game for them, especially dying on a cross, this is like end game for them....... and all the accounts embarrassingly report that the disciples had miss-understood the scriptures and what Jesus had claimed Mark 8:31-32 , Matt 16:21-23 , Luke 24:10-11 , Acts 1:6 , John 20:9) so they defs weren't expecting Jesus to rise from death, as even Thomas is reported not believing........ Plus the disciples all knew each-other and they knew Jesus so this event didn't happen with strangers...

But even if you write off the gospels as later myths.... we still have early creeds and oral sermons handed down which report these as-well (1 Corinthians 15:3-7 , Acts 2:32 , Acts 10:41 )

All the evidence really points to the disciples had to experience something...

Paul also passes down a creed as he received and passes down to others as-well...

1 Corinthians 15:3-7 New International Version (NIV)

**3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance**: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, **4** that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, **5** and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. **6** After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. **7** Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,

Plus the disciples all claim that they seen Jesus together, so if you want to claim it was a hallucination... group hallucinations don't happen.... even if you take the gospels as later myths.... there is still the early creed reporting that Jesus appeared to the group, and early sermons in Acts which report Jesus eating and sitting with the disciples (Acts 10:34-43).... As Bart Ehrman also says ""*I dont doubt at all that some disciples claimed this,... Paul, writing about twenty five years later, indicates that this is what they claimed, and i don't think he is making it up...*

So group hallucinations are improbable as they definitely did report that Jesus appeared in group settings (1 Corinthians 15:3-7 , Acts 2:32 ; 13:30-32) and multi sensory over a period of time (Acts 10:34-43 ; 22:7-9 ; 26:12-18)

\----

Also the narratives embarrassingly portray the disciples as cowardly running away for their lives when Jesus was going to be crucified.... (Matthew 26:31-35, 56 ; Mark 15:50 ; John 20:19 ) they even doubted the reports of the women (Luke 24:11, John 20:24-28) and when they first saw Jesus they were frightened (Luke 24:37-38)..... What this shows is that it cant be an hallucination, as hallucinations happen when someone really expects it but they weren't expecting a dying and rising Messiah God, that was foreign to them, and they definitely didn't expect Jesus to rise again and reported to be frightened when they apparently seen the Risen Christ...

Plus, all independent sources all claim the same thing about Jesus, is that He was in a bodily resurrected body, where he looks sort of like himself but slightly different and his body has new powers that they didn't have before (1 Corinth 15, luke 24, john 20-21 , Matthew 28)

The hallucination theory just doesn't fit, and even if you discount the gospels as unreliable, you still have to account for the early christians and the disciples all reporting a bodily resurrection and not a spiritual appearance...... the first christians are familiar with visions and claimed to have some... yet... they never said the appearances of Christ as mere visions... they firmly believe it was a bodily physical appearance... and that is what they preached from the beginning... ... as even sceptical scholar Gerd Ludemann quotes - *we have no sound way to place the symbolic interpretation of Jesus' resurrection within the context of earliest christian resurrection beleif - Gird Ludemann*

so since the appearances were in group settings, multi-sensory, do not vary, were not interpreted to be spiritual early on, weren't expecting it and weren't exited when seeing Jesus.... its pretty easy to dismiss hallucination theory

Plus Jesus appearances to skeptics.... James and the brothers (like Jude) of Jesus were not his followers before his crucifixion (John 7:5; Mark 3:31-35)

Examples of scholars who Accept this: Betz, Conzelmann, Craig, Derret, Ehrman, Funk, Hoover, Kee, Koester, Ladd, Lorenzen, Ludemann, Meier, Oden, Osborne, Pannenperg, Sanders, Spong, Struhlmacher, Wedderburn Source: The Risen Jesus and the Future Hope, Page 22, 24

And almost unanimously accepted is that Paul was an enemy of the church originally and a later convert... the reason for this is even Paul admits it himself and cites an early creed (Galatians 1:22-23 New International Version (NIV) **22** I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. **23** They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”) and even another attestation from Luke the historian in the book of Acts..... it also meets the criteria of embarrassment that he says himself that he was a former persecutor and was in the wrong.........

The same goes for the conversion of James the brother of Jesus.,.. it is clear in the early material of Paul is that the early leader of the church was none other than James the brother of Jesus, (Gal 1:19; 2:9-12; 1 Corinth 15:7) and even Josephus who is outside the christian sources attests this in (Josephus Jewish Antiquities 20.9.1)....... however, all the sources suggests that James didn't believe his brother was the Christ during his early ministry (John 7:5 For even His brothers did not believe in Him., Mark 3:31-35) ........ No early christian would dare to attack a prominent leader in the church by claiming he was once Jesus' enemy.....

James wasnt even mentioned as one of them at the cross present with Jesus... and Jesus also surrendered his own mother to one of the disciples and why not to one of his own brothers if they were in the christian ranks?

(John 19:25-27 **25** Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the *wife* of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. **26** When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, “Woman, behold your son!” **27** Then He said to the disciple, “Behold your mother!” And from that hour that disciple took her to his own *home.)* this can also explain why most scholars including Bart Ehrman who is an atheist-agnostic accept James and his brothers were early skeptics and only converted **after** the crucifixion.

So the real question is what happened that turned these apposed to Christianity into believers?

Would they lie? why on earth would they do that?? the early church was a persecuted and hated minority with a messiah who was shamefully crucified as a criminal and they were to poor to afford their own tomb... Jesus has dishonoured the family and James was already opposed to his ministry, why would he lie when there is nothing to gain but shame and dishonour to suddenly reverse and proclaim his brother is Lord after he has already mocked him openly (John 7:1-9)........... Paul also had no reason to try this.. he was on top of his game, a prominent leader on the rise and making a name for himself while he persecuted the church (Philipians 3:4-6)... he had all going for him and suddenly he wants to leave all that and join the small persecuted minority that already hate him?

would you say it was an hallucination? neither of them were grieving especially Paul wasn't, James might have been but certainly wasn't expecting a dying and rising messiah to be his own brother who was just killed, a dying and rising messiah God isn't part of second temple judaism beliefs... in-fact Jesus' death would have supported James and his brothers conviction and supported their belief that Jesus isn't the messiah............. and the possibility that Paul had an hallucination is far more lower than James because usually people have hallucinations when they are grieving the death and expecting it not to be so...

What i'm doing is looking at the surrounding facts that accompany these claimed appearances and see which theory is the most plausible with them,... the theories such as the conspiracy, mythic and hallucination theory just doesn't add up with all the facts... what you would have to do is come up with your explanation of the facts and show which plausible theory accounts for the data..

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that supports the preaching of the bodily resurrection of Jesus is the expectation of the gospel to the surrounding world.. the message of Jesus dying on the cross for our sins may sound warm and loving to us.... but in the ancient world, a culture which thrived on honour and status, such a message would be disgusting and horrendous...... Walter Bauer quotes *""The enemies of Christianity always referred to the disgracefulness of the death of Jesus with great emphasis and malicious pleasure. A God or a Son of God dying on a cross! that was enough to put paid on the new religion.""* Crucifixion page 19)

David De-Silva notes the same thing in his work...'Unlocking New Testament Culture Page 51' ""christianity was founded on a premise that should have failed the moment it began""

in such a culture, the christians preached to the gentiles to worship a man that was shamefully executed on a cross... a jewish man..... and romans looked down on jews... a jewish carpenter...... Cicero (A roman statesmen who served as consul in the year 63 BC called carpeting vulgar and compared it to slavery 'De Officiis Liber I XI.II'... on-top of that they preached a physical resurrection to the roman world which was opposed to most pagans...... Even more, the christians placed such high ethical demands on new converts that would of shocked most pagans (no temple prostitutions or extra marital affairs affairs).... morality was radically challenged by christians that flew in the face of most pagans....... the message about Christ was incompatible with the most deeply rooted religious ideology within the gentile world and the roman world....

this is also seen by the christian opponents and how they attacked christianity....

Celcus 177AD ... *but if Jesus was really so great, he ought, in order to display his greatness, to have suddenly dissapeared from the cross. Origen: Contra Celsum 68*

Even the Jews thought that this message of a crucified messiah was disgraceful.... a messiah who was shamefully crucified and murdered by the roman enemy.... their messiah was to be a conquerer, a king, who would restore an earthly kingdom of Israel and defeat Rome..... Jesus was shamed and disgraced,

So this really does cut the conspiracy theory, Knowing the expectation of the gospel would have no group of conspirators would ever have made it their core doctrine..If you'r going to make a message to gain a following, then make something that is appealing and not something that was expected to fail.....

Also taking into consideration the low status of women in the ancient world, it is unanimously accepted in the ancient world that the testimony of women were not to be accepted...

sources such as : But let not the testimony of women be admitted, on account of the levity and boldness of their sex - Josephus, Antiquities, 4.8.15 ..

.... Any evidence which a women gives is not valid to offer -Talmud, Rosh Hashana 1.8c ..

. Let the words of the law be burned rather than committed to women - Rabbi Eleazar ....

But the disciples preached this in their 4 sources Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, that women were the first and primary witnesses to the empty tomb....... this fact would be embarrassing for the early church and just couldn't be made up, ..... first they admitted they didn't even trust the testimonies of the women..

Luke 24:10-11

**10** Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, **11** but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.

Also, all the early sermons in Acts and the Epistles always skip over the fact that women were the first to discover the tomb.,.. (1 Corinth 15, Acts2:22-36 , Acts 19:28-47, Acts 17:22-35, Acts 26:2-23) .... That doesn't contradict the gospels, but they tend to stay silent in this matter in order to make their early case because women aren't deemed to be credible witnesses.. but in the gospels they cant leave the fact out as they are the ones that play a key role in discovering the empty tomb and the first key eye witnesses to the resurrection therefore making their testimony necessary....... and for an ancient writer, this isn't something you would just make up...

Celsus even uses this to try discredit christianity... Celsus (177 AD).. T*hat while alive he was of no assistance to himself, but that when dead he rose again, and showed the marks of his punishment, and how his hands were pierced with nails: who beheld this? a half-frantic woman, as you state, and some other one, perhaps, of those who were engaged in the same system of delusion.""* Origen: Contra Celsum 2.55

NT wright also says *""As historians we are obliged to comment that if these stories had been made up five years later, let alone thirty, forty, or fifty years later, they would never had had Mary Magdalene in this role. To put Mary there is, from the point of view of Christian apologists wanting to explain to a skeptical audience that Jesus really did rise from the dead, like shooting themselves in the foot. But to us as historians this kind of thing is gold dust. The early Christians would never, never have made this up.""* There is a God Page 207

This fact about the women can only be explained if there really was an empty tomb and the early christians just wouldn't lie about women finding it, if they wanted to lie, men would be better candidates..

&amp;#x200B;

**Another key evidence is the immediate proclamation in Jerusalem...**

Paul mentions this as-well as Tacitus also mentions ""Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, **again broke out not only in Judæa, the first source of the evil,** but even in Rome,"" Tacitus Analls 15.44

Paul also mentions in his early epistles that the apostles were still preaching in Jerusalem in Galations 2:1,9

IF the evidence wasn't in their favour, then it would of made sense that the early church should of gone elsewhere, as cults often do, cult leaders often round up their followers and take them away from civilisation or take them elsewhere from a place you can be disproven, just like mormonism when Joseph Smith led his people away from new york...

But the Disciples of Jesus went straight to the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem and told them that they crucified their messiah and he has been raised.... if your an imposter then you would go somewhere else to proclaim your miracle, not in Jerusalem where they have the evidence, motives and the means to debunk it...

Could you say its a really really strong group hallucination that convinced the disciples so much that they know theres an empty tomb in the Jerusalem area and they believed they seen and touched the Risen Christ that they preach in Jerusalem?..... you could... but way more improbable .... as if Jesus is truly resurrected, of-course the disciples had the boldness to proclaim it there as God would have been on their side and all the evidence in their favour...

Going to the voluntary suffering of the disciples, coz this is a big part supporting the resurrection of Jesus... and you say ""Lots of people willing to die for their convictions.""... but you need to understand that their conviction was seeing, touching, talking with the risen Christ...

Multiple attestations of christian and non christian sources attest that early witnesses were persecuted and even martyred for their faith,......Tacitus analls 15.44 (nero persecution), Suetonius 2.51(jews expelled from Rome because of Christus), Josephus antiquities 20.9.1 (James the brother of Jesus was martyred)...

Paul admits intense persecution ... Colossians 1:24, 2 Corinth 11:16-33, Phil 4:12..

Clement of Rome also indicated that Paul and Peter were martyred (1 Clement 5:3-6)

and Paul even boasts about all his sufferings in (2 Corinthians 11:16-33).. and multiple attestations as-well as in Acts and the Epistles that many imprisonments and sufferings the early witnesses endured...

But of-course you would say why are the christians any different? people die for what they believe in all the time... thats true, people do die for some things that are false but they don't die for something they know to be false.... i'm not talking about christians who were martyred, but the disciples and witnesses of Jesus resurrection **who died for believing they seen and touched the risen Christ..**....

The Disciples didn't just die for their beliefs, but for events they claimed had happened and knew very well if they were true or made up, liars make lousy martyrs, when you have nothing to gain, it doesn't make sense to make up and hold on to something that is going to get you nothing....

And the disciples weren't getting much for their new religion..

they were constantly facing persecution: Colossians 1:24; 2 corinthians 11:16-33, Phillipians 4:12; Book of Acts; 1Clement 5:3-6; Annals 15.44; Antiquities 20.9.1 ....

they didn't gain wealth .. 1 Corinth 8; 9,6; 2 Thessalonians 3:8, Acts 24:17

If they were doing it because they were insane and wanting a cult following, then they did some things that did not make any sense... like establishing churches in different regions they didn't have total control over, ... Paul moved from city to city establishing believers and then moving on, ... if your trying to establish a cult in a controlled group of people then you do what cult leaders do, you gather your followers,... remove them from society where there is a threat they will be pulled away by reality, and you keep them very close to keep them brain washed........... the apostles didn't do that, they stayed in populated cities and left their new churches to establish more churches in other cities which leaves your followers vulnerable for corruption...... and if you read the epistles that is what happened, the apostles had to revisit these churches and even write letters to correct them constantly........

it just seems there is nothing to gain in starting christianity unless its a elaborate plan to get martyred... if you say they hallucinated then it must be such a vivid hallucination to convince them that... but as i stated above, that the start of christianity, the preaching of a dying and rising messiah not being made up, and the disciples not expecting Jesus to rise from death .....plus its attested they were frightened when they seen him and not exited as usually hallucinations are when your expecting it so much and get excited when you see what your expecting.... so i doubt it could be such a vivid group hallucination.... but something that convinced them to the point they suffered and died for that belief, could only be attested is if they truly seen and touched the risen Christ.............

&amp;#x200B;

FINAL fact.... the existence of the empty tomb..

Skeptical scholar Jacob Kremer says ""*By far most exegetes hold firmly to the reliability of the biblical statements concerning the empty tomb.""* Die Osterevangelien Page 49-50

The evidence for the empty tomb is also strong......

Some people think that Jesus wasn't buried in a tomb as John Dominic Crossan thinks that and says the Romans would not allow a proper burial for criminals........... This is simply wrong, as we have a source from Josephus in Jewish War 4.317 that says crucified victims were buried .... and 2 independent early sources that say Jesus was buried in a tomb (Mark 15:42, - 16:8 ; Paul in 1 Corinth 15:3-8)

Also we have archaeological evidence of a crucified victim who received a proper burial (Search on google Yohanan Ben Ha'galgo)....

Jesus burial also meets the criteria of embarrassment since they say he was buried in a tomb of a Sanhedrin member which would have been dishonouring for the followers...... such a group had just murdered their Lord, and now they need to bum a tomb for him from one of the members of those who murdered their Lord?..........

Also the fact that the gospels attest the name of the person who buried Jesus.. Joseph of Arimathea means the tomb was public knowledge and its whereabouts was known, ..... so the public at any time would know about it and readily debunk it if the tomb wasn't empty......... and the account of the empty tomb is also embarrassing as its discovered by women, and as mentioned earlier, this isnt something you would make up...

Matthew also mentions the competing theory when he mentions 'the jews claim the disciples stole the body"" (Matt 28)........

Justin Martyr writing later, had to respond to this theory, because it was the official story that the jews were telling people...

""\*his disciples stole him by night from the tomb, where he was laid when unfastened from the cross, and now deceive men by asserting that he has risen from the dead and ascended to heaven."" -\*said by Trypho ..Justin Martyr Dialogue with Trypho Chapter 108

So Justin Martyr writing later, had to respond to this theory, because it was the official story that the jews were telling people... which is an interesting admission, because it says the body cannot be found, if the Sanhedrin still had the body, they could of had the gentiles bring it out for them and show the tomb was never empty..... but the christians never had to respond to this charge (so both sides agree the tomb was empty)...

Also we have the **Nazareth Inscription,** a stone found in the area and has written on it an Imperial Decree from around 41 AD.. it says...

*""EDICT OF CAESAR: It is my decision* ***\[concerning\] graves and tombs***\*—whoever has made them for the religious observances of parents, or children, or household members—that these remain undisturbed forever. But if anyone legally charges that another person has destroyed, or has in any manner extracted those who have been buried, or has moved with wicked intent those who have been buried to other places, committing a crime against them, or has moved sepulcher-sealing stones, against such a person I order that a judicial tribunal be created, just as \[is done\] concerning the gods in human religious observances, even more so will it be obligatory to treat with honor those who have been entombed. You are absolutely not to allow anyone to move \[those who have been entombed\].\* ***But if \[someone does\], I wish that \[violator\] to suffer capital punishment under the title of tomb-breaker.""***

So it says the penalty for grave robbing is death, which is interesting because its very severe of how romans punished thieving, the romans wouldn't give such a high penalty for stealing something... normally they would need to pay for the damages 2 or 4 fold, and possibly face a flogging.... ......

But this would all make sense with the rise of Christianity and what Suetonius tells us..

Life of claudius 25.4 *Since the jews constantly made riots at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from rome*

So 1.Some jews in Rome were preaching about Christs resurrection and riots resulted from it.

2 If Jesus tomb was not empty.

4. There would be no need for this imperial decree about grave robbing because Rome could just produce the body to dispel the riots.

But because the only alternative explanation is that the body is missing because the body was stolen, Romes only option is to issue a decree to try to combat the accounts of the missing body........ if there was a body, then Rome could have just expel the riots with the body.... and not have to indirectly admit the body was missing with an Imperial Decree...

So it appears to be that from all sides, the body was missing (Jews, Romans, Christians).... either way, theres no evidence the empty tomb was just a fabrication and this is why most scholars today accept the empty tomb

The only theory that accounts for all this data is that Jesus indeed died and resurrected after 3 days....... the conspiracy theory doesn't account for the quality of the testimony of the disciples,...... the empty tomb,.... and why skeptics would join a small persecuted minority.......

the hallucination theory would only work if you posit some pretty miraculous hallucinations that causes the disciples to change their idea, skeptics to convert and posit crazy ideas of a dying and rising messiah no one was expecting or looking for... and a crazy hallucination that the tomb was empty as-well..

&amp;#x200B;

The resurrection theory that God raised Jesus from the dead accounts for all the data, it has

1.explanatory scope because it explains all the facts, it has

2.explanatory power as it explains all the facts with the least amount of effort, and

3. Illumination, as it offers other areas in history as it offers how christianity truly did start.

c behan mccullagh who has outlined the criteria for weighing historical theories accepts the resurrection hypothesis meets these 3 things better than any other hypothesis.... however he also claims it fails the other two pieces of criterion (ad hoc and plausibility) Quotes

*""This Christian hypothesis is of greater explanatory scope and power than other hypothesis which try to account for the relevant evidence, but is less plausaible and more ad hoc than they are."" C* Behan Mccullagh in his book Justifying Historical Descriptions Page 21.

Ofcourse there has been replies and arguments about if it really is less plausible and more ad hoc.... because it makes one more supposition..... (That God exists)....

I believe the hallucination theory cant account for multiple sensory hallucinations and group hallucinations and that they were so powerful that the disciples took it to their death and suffered for it.... plus a mass city hallucination of an empty tomb....

The conspiracy theory wants us to believe a bunch of frightened followers of Jesus , stole the body in secret in an over crowded city, to make up a story they weren't expecting and wasn't inline with jewish messianic expectations in order to get themselves martyred, and some of the skeptics decided to join this persecuted minority for no reason at all..

The resurrection theory only allows us to add the assumption that God exists, so it isn't more ad hoc than the other theories, and there are many arguments for the existence of God,...

If one insists on a naturalistic world view, and leaves no reason for theism being a possibility, then they can say the resurrection theory is improbable, but that also argues from a presupposition and not being open to evidence regardless of how one feels about it....

So the resurrection theory is more plausible and less ad hoc than the rest of the theories.... the evidence is mounted and that is why the non christian Anthony Flew was bold enough to say

*""The evidence for the ressurection is better than for claimed miracles in any other religion. Its outstandingly different in quality and quantity - Anthony Flew ""*

The resurrection theory is the only theory that accounts for all the data and being less ad hoc and more plausible than the rest, its evidence is mounted, as Paulo Frederickson admitted ""They must have seen something"", and all the evidence favours that what they saw was the risen Christ.",OrthodoxChristianity
"Is Holy Mother Mary the ""Empress of Hell"" and not just the Glorious Queen of Heaven? In addition a Matriarch of sternness and Lady of War and not just a soft compassionate mother?",EvaWolve,1606029996,"Two articles I read last night

https://history.umd.edu/events/%E2%80%9Ccall-me-empress-hell%E2%80%9D-intercessory-power-virgin-mary-later-middle-ages

Using the social science, hard scientific approach, and studies  of literature and mythology approach to religion, many scholars and academics state archetypes have a dual side. For a Greek pagan example Ares may be the God of War but he is also the God of civil order and police and even prayed to for asking for peace in personal life. As well as the God who is most respectful to women.

Jesus is seen as having not just dual but multiple sides such as the peaceloving human who sacrificed everything for humanity, the ruthless warlike Yahweh, and the Holy Spirit who inspires and directly intervenes. Similar parallels are made about Shiva in Hindu mythology where Shiva has a warlike incarnation, a peaceful human like form, etc.

So Are the two articles correct? I seen the Empress of Hell title in multiple Medieval Folklore before as well as Mary being used as a symbol of war by early barbarians and carrying of Mary statues, medals, etc by Crusader orders and even lowly European militia.",OrthodoxChristianity
Stance on Piercings? (From Inquirer),russianveg,1606029432,"Hi everyone! I hope you're all doing well :) 

I was hoping that I may get some general guidance (although I have a a feeling that this is an ask-your-priest sort of situation) about some comments I've gotten in the last month. I'm an inquirer into the Church and have been attending regularly for the last 3 months or so, but recently moved countries (from the US to Spain) and went from attending an Antiochian to a Serbian parish. In the last couple of weeks, the popadija and another lady who is a member both expressed their concern about my piercings (I have 1 on each ear lobe, and 2 cartilage piercings in different places on each ear, but only keep in the cartilage ones). Most of it was because they were worried about how it would affect my physical wellbeing (the popadija was/is a practitioner of acupuncture and said that the piercings could eventually cause pain in different regions of the body corresponding to their placement).

I suppose it left me feeling a bit odd just because I never heard anything about piercings back in the Antiochian parish, and it also kind of reminded me of an ex who was a strict observer of a conservative, non-jewelry wearing Protestant group and who had made it abundantly clear that he didn't like them.

In all honesty, I don't really think about them all that often and – I think – they are quite discreet. I do like the look of them and one is sentimental, as a best friend and I got them done in the same place on our upper left ears as a sort of celebration for finishing high school exams, but at the end of the day, I don't mind taking them out if it's an issue of faith/obedience.

2. why we pray to Saints?Jesus said to pray to God.

3.Why we pray to icons?It goes against the 2nd commandment.

Orthodox view of getting COVID in church,keybsnbits,1605992676,"First off, I’m an Orthodox Christian so please don’t take offense to my questions - I’m not being provocative, but simply trying to better understand. I believe that science is our best understanding of the “how” of God’s creation and is not inherently at odds with it. For that reason I’ve had confusion around COVID/church/sacraments.

* Does the church believe that you can get COVID if you receive communion after somebody who is sick receives communion from the same chalice/spoon?
* Does the church recommend that clergy wear a mask during the liturgy? Does the church believe you can get COVID from a priest during the liturgy (through kissing/breathe/etc)? How about another parishioner?
* Knowing that singing causes more aerosols to be released into an indoor space, why aren’t more churches opting for prerecorded choir singing?
* Why are churches following local law instead of what is best for the health of parishioners according to scientists? For instance, when the state allows 50% capacity, so has my local church.

My confusion partially stems from the fact that I haven’t seen literature about safety in church during the pandemic, and therefore don’t know where things stand. Thank you in advance.",OrthodoxChristianity

The Saints who wrote these texts were concerned with inner  asceticism, ceaseless prayer, and how one may attain a life of  contemplative stillness and union with God. These precious Philokalic  texts are the glory of the Church, and reveal the path to spiritual  sobriety, and the Prayer of the Heart. For some years Patristic Nectar  Publications has provided a small portion of the whole Philokalia as  audio books, with a Path of Entry guide provided by Father Maximos  Constas. Today we are enthused to announce an ambitious new project to  professionally record in studio the entire Philokalia, and to make it  available in its entirety at PNP for free. Toward this end we have made a  $40,000 recording commitment, and have received an initial $20,000  matching grant from a generous PNP supporter.

"Losing my faith over what I see as blantant contradictions regarding the Day of Judgement in Christianity, and the Day of Judgement as espoused by the prophets",CatholicShield,1605984944,"Isaiah 66:15-16 opens with an account that this is the Day of the LORD (Judgement Day)

&gt;“For behold, the LORD will come in fire, and his chariots like the whirlwind, to render his anger in fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire will the LORD enter into judgment, and by his sword, with all flesh; and those slain by the LORD shall be many.

God continues in Isaiah 66:17 to say that He will kill Jews who eat unclean foods:

&gt;“Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, eating pig’s flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, declares the LORD.

This is totally at odds with Christianity's claims that in Mark Jesus ""declared all foods clean"", Saint Peter being told to eat unclean foods by God in a vision during Acts, and Saint Pauls theology regarding keeping kosher.

Continuing on Isaiah 66:22-23 says that in the new heavens and the new earth God will continue will to be worshiped on the Sabbath, as if nothing ever changed from His commandments regarding to observe it:

&gt;“For as the new heavens and the new earth that I make shall remain before me, says the LORD, so shall your offspring and your name remain. From new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, declares the LORD.

Zachariah 14:1 opens with the same account that the day of the LORD has come:

&gt;Behold, a day is coming for the LORD...

After describing some of the calamities that will come on Judgement Day it resumes in Zachariah 14:16 that all the survivors of the gentiles will come celebrate the feast of booths.

&gt;Then everyone who survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Booths.

Again, another apparent contradiction to Christianity. Saint Paul in Galatians 4:9-10 chastises the Church in Galatia for being judaized and accepting Jewish holy days:

&gt;But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more? You observe days and months and seasons and years!

I don't know what to make of all this. I unfortunately feel like if I explore even deeper to what is said about the ""Day of the LORD"" by the prophets it would only lead to more apparent contradictions.

God killing Jews who eat unclean foods, the observance of the Sabbath in the news heavens and the new earth, the observance of the Feast of Booths by gentiles by those who survive the Day... Christianity seems to contradict what is preached by the prophets.

Question about devotion to Mary from a Catholic,Jdcarty,1605969799,"I've noticed from observation that both Eastern and Western Christianity hold the role of Mary to much the same standard. Mary is the Mother and aide to all Christians and her role is so important in both Eastern and Western Christianity that I've even heard Orthodox Saints saying that the prayer ""Most Holy Theotokos save me a sinner"" uttered at the moment of death will save an otherwise damned soul.

My question is how does Orthodox devotion to Mary manifest? Catholics have the rosary and we propogate the rosary prayer as the most important prayer in the Church(outside of the mass), it's a prayer that devote Catholics do not go without and it's so important to us we literally see it as the answer to all the problems in the world. It's very nature is a Marian prayer, a prayer that for 20 minutes every day we invoke the Blessed Virgin so I'd imagine if any Catholic loves the Blessed Virgin he also loves the rosary.

How does Orthodoxy manage to likewise instill such a deep love for the Blessed Virgin when it's not a religious standard to enforced praying to Mary everyday, when a prayer like the rosary isn't so widely propagated in Eastern spirituality? If I've come off as condescending in any way, please forgive me. I deeply admire the Eastern Church and our shared love for The Eucharist and The Holy Theotokos inspires me.

The feast of the honored Archangel Michael (Coptic),crypto_junkie2040,1605968007,"On this day the church celebrates the feast of the honored Archangel, Michael, the head of the hosts of heaven, who stands at all times before the great throne of God, interceding on behalf of the human race.Joshua, the son of Nun, saw him in great glory and was frightened by him and fell on his face to the earth and said to him, ""Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"" So he said, ""No; but as Commander of the army of the Lord... I have given Jericho into your hand, ... and its king."" (Joshua 5:13-15, 6:2)The Archangel Michael was with all the saints and martyrs. He strengthened them and enabled them to endure patiently until they finished their strife. Festivals of commemoration are held and alms offered in his name on the twelfth day of each Coptic month.An example of one of his wonders: A God-fearing man whose name was Dorotheus and his wife Theopista, held a festival of commemoration for the honored angel Michael on the twelfth day of each month. It happened that this righteous family fell on hard times and had nothing to celebrate with for the commemoration of the honored Michael. They took their clothes to sell so that they might have a feast. Michael the Archangel appeared to Dorotheus and commanded him not to sell his clothes, but to go to a sheep-master and to take from him a sheep worth one-third of a dinar.He was also to go to a fisherman and to take from him a fish worth one-third of a dinar but Dorotheus was not to slit open the fish until he came back to him. Finally, he was to go to a flour merchant and to take from him as much flour as he needed.Dorotheus did as the Angel commanded him. He invited the people, as was his custom, to the feast honoring the Archangel Michael. When he went into his storeroom looking for wine for the offering, he found that all the containers had been filled with wine and many other good things. He marvelled and was astonished.After they had finished the celebration and all the people had departed, the Archangel appeared to Dorotheus as before and commanded him to cut open the belly of the fish. He found 300 dinars of gold and three coins each is a third of a dinar. He told him these three coins were for the sheep, the fish and the flour, and the 300 dinars were for him and his children. God had remembered them and their oblations and had rewarded them here, in this world and in the kingdom of heaven on the last day. As Dorotheus and his wife were astonished at this matter, the Archangel Michael said to them, ""I am Michael the Archangel who delivered you from all your tribulations and I have taken your oblations and alms up to God, you shall lack no good thing whatsoever in this world."" They prostrated themselves before him and he disappeared and went up into heaven. This was one of the innumerable miracles of this honored Angel.His intercession be for us and Glory be to our God, forever. Amen.",OrthodoxChristianity

I attended my first Divine Liturgy at an Eastern Catholic Church.

I sought out both Tridentine and Eastern rites but just couldn’t find a parish that seemed to fit.

By that I mean, what does Orthodoxy say that the role of the Bishop of Rome should be? Even if it's only *slightly* more authority than the other bishops, I find it more likely that his role would expand to be what it is today in the Catholic Church, than for it to be absolutely none, i.e. I find it more likely that his authority would increase as the doctrine of the Papacy developed, than that it would decrease.

Please shed some light on this or let me know if you think I'm misunderstanding something.

Also, it seems like your theology is kind of murky, that is, it can vary slightly from Orthodox Church to Orthodox Church, which I admit might be the way Christ intended it, as opposed to the Catholic way, but here's my question: If there are no **firm** beliefs, other than what most of you believe and have believed for the most time, ex. the Trinity, Mary being Theotokos, etc., why is it a **firm** belief that only the first seven councils are legitamate. Why are the Oriental Orthodox wrong to say that only the first three are legitimate?

I ask because you have no papal or church infallibility, yet you have the **firm, infallible** belief that **only** the first seven councils are legitamate; I want to know where this belief comes from.

18 YO Russian Orthodox / King James Bible Question,Genesis-Athmosphere,1605857588,"Moved to Germany when I was 4, russian is my first language, learned german in school and english when I got into my teenage years.. so I am able to speak 3 languages fluently. The only problem is that I am able to speak russian without any accent or problems, but my reading is slow and my writing i really bad.

I watched the movie ""The Book Of Eli"" a couple months ago and was interested in the KJV of the Bible (which Eli ""Denzel Washington"" carried with him. So I decided to buy it. Because I am slow at reading cyrillic I tought that this is my only way to read the best translated bible in a language I know.

I am know unsure what to do, I think I could just start reading the orthodox bible, slowly getting better every day.. thats even what my mom said. She said that reading KJV was useless, russian is a more spiritual language for me as it is my first language. My mom is a russian teacher and told me that she can teach me cyrillic in a couple months, it will be easy cause I can speak russian (i just never really used it here in europe)

Protestant Questions,Alternative-Bluejay6,1605841360,"Hi I'm considering Orthodoxy or Catholicism:

If one of the Orthodox churches is the one Christ established, which one is it? Because as far as I'm aware, in, it might be the Greek or the Russian Orthodox church, contraception and/or divorce and remarriage is allowed in rare cases. There's no way Christ would have established a 'church', in which one church says something is a sin and another allows it.

So am I misunderstanding something, and if not, which of the Orthodox churches is the one Christ established?

Second question:

How do you know that what you believe, your dogmas, are true? Ex. the Trinity, Mary being Theotokos, etc. You believe all bishops can be fallible and make mistakes, so how do you know which of your dogmas are errors, and which are, and forever will be, true? Catholics believe their dogmas because they argue Jesus promised the Holy Spirit would lead the apostles into all truth, and gave them the keys to 'bind and loose', the idiom meaning, as far as I know, that what they 'bind' will have already been 'bound', i.e. by God; they're not establishing dogma, but having it revealed to them by God.

How do you know your dogmas are true?

Was Mary's seed (egg) immaculate?,TheLostLadino,1605831589,"-Let's keep it light in these stressful times, and ponder this, a gift from my old friend John Mauser (RIP).
-God prophesied of ""her (Eve's) seed"" in Genesis 3:15.
-Until the invention of telescopes, the entire world didn't know women had eggs, and thought that men had one single seed in the sperm, not the millions we know now.  They thought a man has one single seed they plant into the woman, the woman being nothing more than an incubator who offers no genetic material to the child.  Galatians 3:16, Abraham's seed-not-seeds, takes on a different light if we use this older paradigm.
-So, knowing that Eve was created with all her seeds, or eggs, in a sinless state, and that only God knew at the time that women had seed (what a prophetic miracle is that?)...
-Biology tells us that a girl-child in the womb has all her eggs formed in her ovaries before birth, pre-birth being a theologically sinless and immaculate state.
-So, from Eve's sinless seed/egg, her daughter conceived from it and forming her own sinless seed/egg while still in the womb, on and on until Mary, Mary's sinless seed/egg.
-Voila, immaculate seed/egg imbued with God's Son, immaculate conception.  Immaculately created in Eve, immaculately created from in-utero daughter to in-utero daughter and, finally and immaculately, to the Mother of God.",OrthodoxChristianity

Struggling greatly with theosis and the paradox of a transformational theology,kiooko,1605830106,"Okay, so off the bat, I greatly appreciate the concept of theosis and personal transformation of this Church that I am baptized in.

However, I'm struggling with an internal paradox. It's kind of like this: we stress the deification and transformation of man so strongly in our theologies. It's beautiful, it makes sense, it blows me away with its coherence.

...Yet I don't necessarily see nicer people among the Orthodox parish than among atheists, Jews, Muslims, etc. History wise, we have plenty of bloodshed and oppressive behavior, just like everyone else has.

I get told that it's because we're all sinful people, and I understand this. Maybe I don't have the vision to see this transformation, I don't know. But it seems like, ironically, those of any faith (be they Christian, Jewish, Muslim, non-Abrahamic) who constantly stress the moral superiority of their faith over everyone else's also tend to come off as the more unpleasant to speak to (at least in my experience). 

And it's not that I'm a relativist. I don't believe every faith is or can be equally true. But I can't see especially good fruits among the Orthodox that I feel like we should see as the True Church, and I'm always afraid of veering into self-righteousness if I try to look for the good fruits in our faith in comparison to other groups or traditions.",OrthodoxChristianity

**SPOILER ALERTS:**

The two priests discuss the theory that pagan gods were real -- they are what we'd call Fallen Angels. From what I gather, God the Father shared his power with angels, who were given dominion over Creation, and may have even played a part in evolution ('shaping' Creation).

After God created mankind, He gave certain angels the responsibility of caring for different human tribes. However, some of these angels enjoyed their power too much, and forced men to worship them: they even coerced men to build monuments glorifying the Fallen Angels, instead of The One True God. The institutions of slavery, human sacrifice, and temple prostitution arose from these interactions.

My questions are multiple:

1. I am not sure I buy this theory, but perhaps it's because I'm a product of modernism. However, I'd like to read more about this. Are there any good resources you can recommend?
2. Did ancient angelic beings gift certain technologies to men?

Does Jesus Save Aliens?,BazDim2,1605746423,"Alright, I know, with everything going on these days this is probably not top of mind for everyone, but I’m working in fleshing out a bit of lore in something I’m writing and I wanted to hear your thoughts. Humour me a moment.

How would Orthodoxy reconcile the existence of life beyond Earth, if it were to be discovered? Let’s imagine that we discover that intelligent, moral, non-human beings exist in the galaxy, with intelligence comparable to our own and fully self-aware and sapient. 

Do we believe that Jesus’ sacrifice redeemed them also? On the one hand, I feel like the answer can’t be no because that would be limiting God’s redemptive power through Christ. However, God incarnated into *mankind*, not alienkind, so do we think that this would mean that humanity has a special role, relative to other sapient life? Or is it that humanity’s Fall was unique to our species? Perhaps other intelligent life never had a Fall-Event necessitating a redemptive sacrifice. 

Basically, how does Christ, who was incarnated as a human being, save non-human beings, without participating in their material reality? It seems like either (1) Christ saves everyone, which seems odd because it requires no participation on the part of the aliens, or (2) Christ does not save everyone, which seems to limit God’s redemption, or (3) many incarnations happened amongst many species, which seems almost like it limits the importance of Jesus’ unique reality among us, or (4) aliens did not require redemption as they did not have a Fall like we did, which seems sort of unsatisfying in a way I can’t quite describe.",OrthodoxChristianity

Really weird sensations all over my body (because of damaged nerves), tinnitus, hyperacusia, disequilibrium, vertigo, heightened sense of smell (you might think this is a positive thing but It's not) and restless legs at night. I have other symptoms aswell.

I have no friends, no acquaintances, no education, no job, no hobbies, no support and a very little money.

I have no family really. I have a little (step) brother (I love him so much) who lives with my mother. My mother has mistreated and abused me my whole life but I still have to be in contact with her because I have no one else to help me and being with her is the only way I can see my little brother.

I haven't seen my dad in 18 years but I miss him so much all the time.

God has never answered my prayers. I have tried to approach God very seriously but whenever I have done so something bad has happened. I feel  cursed. I have a severe PTSD (from religion). I cannot open the Bible anymore. I just can't. I honestly can't.

I just want even a one single word from God. Maybe you can help me with this and ask God if he would give me a word or sentence or anything  because like I said he has never answered to me even though I have prayed a lot. I would be happy even with some random word like ""pigeon"" or something as long as I know it's from God.

This is all true. Ask God to confirm this. This is all too much for one man really. Please pray for me (and others who have similar symptoms). Sorry, if I don't answer any comments. I need hope. I really do. I don't want to end my life.",OrthodoxChristianity

A Question (Can't Think of a Better Title),Mount_Saint_Michael,1605674896,"I have always been ""religious"" so to speak, but I have never really looked into any religion. I have started looking into Christianity recently as I had a sort of existential crisis (I can't think of any better words to describe it) and so far I have been really liking it. Basic advice such as ""Love your enemy"" has been very helpful in my day to day life and has really made me a better person I feel. There is just one big aspect that has been bothering me. From what I understand so far, if a person does not accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, when they die, they go to Hell. What about good people? What about my family? Now that I think about it, this question is contradictory. I suppose God has a plan for everyone, and some people are destined to never believe? I am sorry if this sounds incoherent or doesn't make sense,  I can't seem to find just the right words to express my question. It has been troubling me for a very long time at this point. I have talked to my parents about this (Not Christian, but religious). They say that what I am doing is like trying to find sand on a beach. The more I grip my hand around the sand, the more it all comes pouring out. Only when I do not try so hard to find these answers, I will realize that the whole beach is filled with sand. My mother says at her age she wasn't very religious at all, but when she was older she realized that she should be. They say that I should focus more on enjoying my life (I am quite young and still in school) and doing well in classes/building a relationship with my family (I have become very distant from my brother recently and I do not feel good about it). The reason I came to this sub was because I have always found Orthodox Christianity to be the most appealing in terms of Christianity, and I wonder what you fine people think about my situation. It isn't very serious, but just a question I have had for a while. Also I created this account before I started looking into religion, Mount Saint Michael happens to be the name of one of my favorite songs.",OrthodoxChristianity

Is anyone else struggling to join during this pandemic?,qc013330,1605652527,"Hey friends,

I’m just curious if anyone else is having trouble joining The Church this year. My spouse and I decided to start trying out Orthodoxy after a couple years being interested, right before the pandemic started. The local churches all had to shut down, so we started watching services online. That was good as it was our first exposure to actual liturgy and other services. It was during this time we found out we were expecting a child, so we even talked about how maybe we could all join and get the baby baptized into the Church, too.

Churches reopened a couple months after that,  so we started attending in person. Then, it was like every spiritual attack possible was lobbed against us to prevent us from going. I work in emergency services, and with Covid our schedules and workloads change all the time and frequently prevented us from going to liturgy. Once, we thought the baby was in distress and had to go to the ER and miss church. Another time, a family member had an emergency and we were the only ones who could help, again missing church. Other times one of us would be sick, so we’d stay home in case it happened to be Covid. It seemed like weekly, something crazy would come up.

Now Covid cases are skyrocketing again and churches are re-closing. Our dream of joining the church this year seems to be out the window. Our maternal doctor recommends we self-isolate because Covid could kill the baby in utero, so we’ll be home almost all the time till it’s born. After that, we’ll be isolating for its health even longer. The local priest has been so great and helpful and given us advice to use a prayer book and keep up with services online, but it doesn’t feel the same to me.

I finally have guided her to the faith - but she doesn't want to be ""out"" as a Christian, meaning she doesn't want her friends to know, because she occupies a high position in the Communist Party of Serbia. I'm quite sure that her colleagues wouldn't mind since the party isn't explicitly atheist or anti-theist, but she still worries what they'll think. I am very public about my faith and have attended functions for the party, of which I have special membership status due to living abroad. They don't care that I'm a Christian and are actually very civil discussion-wise. But she occupies a higher position in the party, so she's under closer watch.

Our Priest has used loose interpretations of the Bishop’s guidelines to allow us to operate as such.

It nearly seems like a completely different religion especially when it comes to the fate of the unbaptized who are gleefully consigned to hell.

OT Prophecies of Christ referring to Him as a creature,BonifaceXIII,1605590633,"Hello again, I come with another question.   


One of the things I find unsettling is how Christ is described in the scriptures. Even though I understand that certain parts of the scriptures, such as the prologue of the gospel of John, make it undeniably clear that Christ is God and not a creature, other, lesser known, parts are not so clear. I wanted to ask about two of these that I have come across.   


**SIRACH 24:**  


&gt; **1** Wisdom shall praise her own self, and shall be honoured in God, and shall glory in the midst of her people,   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;**5** I came out of the mouth of   
&gt;  
&gt;the most High, the firstborn before all creatures:  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;**12**  Then the creator of all things commanded, and said to me: and he that made me, rested in my tabernacle,    
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;**14** From the beginning, and before the world, **was I created**, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him. 

When I read this chapter a few days ago I was actually stunned at just how incredible it is and how clearly it is a prophecy of Christ. We have God's Wisdom, Sofia, coming out of the mouth of God, like a Word, and being made to rest in its tabernacle(the Theotokos?) The only thing I find uncomfortable about the chapter is the use of the word *created* in verse 14. If anybody professed Christ to be created before the world, we would condemn them as heretics, but it appears that this is the exact terminology the book of Sirach uses.

**PROVERBS 8:**

&gt; **12** “I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence;  
 I possess knowledge and discretion.   
...  
&gt;  
&gt;**22 “The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works,\[**[**c**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-16625c)**\]\[**[**d**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-16625d)**\]**  
 **before his deeds of old;**  
**23** I was formed long ages ago,  
 at the very beginning, when the world came to be.  
**24** When there were no watery depths, I was given birth,  
 when there were no springs overflowing with water;  
**25** before the mountains were settled in place,  
 before the hills, I was given birth,  
**26** before he made the world or its fields  
 or any of the dust of the earth.  
**27** I was there when he set the heavens in place,  
 when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,  
**28** when he established the clouds above  
 and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,  
**29** when he gave the sea its boundary  
 so the waters would not overstep his command,  
and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.  
**30**  Then I was constantly\[[e](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-16633e)\] at his side.  
I was filled with delight day after day,  
 rejoicing always in his presence,  
**31** rejoicing in his whole world  
 and delighting in mankind.  
&gt;  
&gt;**32** “Now then, my children, listen to me;  
 blessed are those who keep my ways.  
**33** Listen to my instruction and be wise;  
 do not disregard it.  
**34** Blessed are those who listen to me,  
 watching daily at my doors,  
 waiting at my doorway.  
**35** For those who find me find life  
 and receive favor from the Lord.  
**36** But those who fail to find me harm themselves;  
 all who hate me love death.”

I also find this chapter fascinating, as it's the same figure, 'Sofia,' being described as 'brought forth' before the creation of the world. But again, the problem is that he's described as being brought forth as the *first of his works,* of old. Not brought forth *before* our Lord's works, but as the first of them. The Septuagint even uses the word 'created' in verse 22.

Thank you,TryingToUnderStand93,1605569595,"I posted roughly 2 weeks ago about if orthodox churches in NYC accepted Africans and you guys gave me the courage and suggestions of churches to go to. On Sunday , I attended my first orthodox mass ( sorry , I don’t know the proper terminology). When I entered the church , I was scared because I thought that I would be the center of attention. I thought that the people there would make me give speech telling them why I was there . But , God really humbled me. God made me realize that in his house , everyone is there to worship him. I saw white people, Asians , middle eastern , and etc . Everyone was there praising God . 

During the first half of the mass ( never knew the mass was 2 hours and 30 minutes ) , I was confused by what was happening because I only ever experienced a Catholic mass. However , when the priest read the gospel and did his homily , everything made sense. The second half made me feel the feeling that I was searching for but I didn’t know where to find.  The homily was about the Good Samaritan and how Jesus told us to love everyone as our neighbor regardless of race , religion , and etc.  

So , thank you for clearing up my old misconception about orthodox Christianity  / my own internal fear of being rejected.

First Ever Reddit Post,IL0veBOXING,1605565832,"Greetings everyone.

I am a brand new member of reddit, and I am unsure how this works, so please forgive me for any inconsistencies. I actually joined reddit because I could not find any actual orthodox forums on the internet (catholic answers equivalent)

A bit about myself. I am a 26 year old in Canada who was born and raised as a catholic, but I became disillusioned with catholicism. I backed away from catholicism and became a platonist for two years (I am a lover of philosophy). In those two years I put God on the sidelines, ended up having a kid outside of marriage and pretty much lived a life for myself. I had a heart to heart with God one night and from then on made a decision to return back to God. I would like to also point out that eastern orthodoxy has been on my radar for 7 years now, but I slowly am committing more to learning about orthodoxy. 

I basically found this forum in hopes of learning more about the faith and having some of my questions answered. The main thing about orthodoxy that attracts me is its emphasis on the ""mystery"" of God himself, as well as the emphasis on continual prayer with God, through fasting, prayer, and continual acceptance of ones sinfulness in order to allow God into ones heart. 

Anyway that pretty much sums it all up, I am looking forward to hearing more from you all!",OrthodoxChristianity
Roman Catholic here trying to figure it all out (again). I'm considering Orthodoxy and I have some questions.,HeartCaveHermit,1605564230,"Hello christian brothers and sisters. I am considering the Roman Catholic priesthood and  perhaps it is the devil trying to tempt me but I've had a lot of doubts concerning catholicism vs. orthodoxy lately (sorry if that came off rude i mean no disrespect). I had some questions for you all if you dont mind answering, thank you for all who do.

1) Ive recently watched a video explaining the catholic position on the filioque and I found it compelling, https://youtu.be/_Rrzo55G364 . I know its two hours long so dont feel pressured to watch it. Why is the filioque heresy?

2) Papacy. I've heard or read some things from eastern and western church fathers that suggest the papacy is the neccessary. I've also heard that an ecumenical council isn't really ecumenical if the pope, papal legate, or papal approval in some way is not involoved. Is this true? This is a big hang up for me simply because the orthodox church doesnt seem unified, but like many churches with very similar theology.

3) How is the OC unified? In the creed we proclaim or respective church are ""one"", for us that because we are under the pope and the councils. How is the orthodox church one? It just seems, like I said before, like many different church with very similar theology most of the time. Some problems i have specifically regarding this: different beliefs regarding rebaptizing, contraception, divore and remarriage (I heard you could get divorced 3 time??? is that true?).

4) I'm just scared that if I am convinced of orthodoxy and I'm wrong than I will go to hell. It may sound irrational, but that where I am, a poor sinner afraid of leaving God's church and being sent to hell for it. I know enough about catholic theology to know that if I leave knowing full well all the Catholic Church teaches regarding itself then I will be sent to hell (the whole ""two lungs"" nonsense if Vatican ll ambiguity and traditional Catholics do not subscribe to it).

Interested in orthodoxy but anxious M/18yr/inquirer,esoR-mihpareS,1605563947,"Skip to bottom for question. Sorry for the ugly wall of text I do end up venting a bit too much and there is a TLDR the bottom I'm just really unsure about if I'm making the right decision to join the EO Church.

To give some background I'm a first year university ( or college) student and my interest in the orthodox is growing. Unfortunately I haven't been to a divine liturgy because of the current situation. From what I know the places I'm interested in staying for second year are close to a Greek orthodox church and a Russian orthodox church so I'm a bit spoiled for choice. 
The area I'm from is pretty heavily atheistic for my age group.

Faith has always been something that was important to me (had a few otherworldly spiritual experiences to nudge me). I was raised Anglican (CofE) but looking thurther into the history showed me it wasn't the true church. 
Funny thing is I suggested to a atheist friend to look into either Catholicism or orthodoxy and now he is catholic. My only other Christian friend at home is a protestant (idk what denom).

Whilst looking into Catholicism I came across Orthodoxy. The main concern for me was never just how beautiful the services was but about finding the true apostolic church (though from viewing a divine liturgy online I have to say it was absolutely amazing and I did shed a tear as I saw it) (TLM is wonderful  aswell). 
Language whilst incredibly difficult I'm willing to put in the time to learn a bit of either Church Slavonic or Koine Greek if I have to. 

Even though media is heavily geared towards Catholicism from living in the uk it just seems like the arguments to stop people from converting to orthodoxy are low effort. 
Various parts of Catholicism honestly puzzled me like NFP (despite being as effective as a condom if done properly) not being contraception yet you are allowed to manipulate your hormones through breastfeeding  but not with the pill.
Annulments being less strict than divorces, the papacy acting in the first 7 ecumenical councils, filoque,  ,accusations of polytheism when mentioning the essence energy distinctions ect. Again I'm not criticising since im not qualified to do a genuine critic of Catholicism.

It didn't help that the go to for whenever I was interested in EO the default go to was ""just  become eastern catholic"" (no hate to the east caths). Saying how EP is modernistic like  Francis by the Rad Trads. Sometimes calling hesychasm ""just yoga"" ect. Whilst internet orthodoxy is not representative of parish life at all it has helped me come to better conclusions for the sake of pulling me towards orthodoxy.

The only thing I've started incorporating apart from attending a Divine liturgy virtually every sunday has been praying the jesus prayer, which honestly has had an impact on my life.

Anyway my main gripes are the anxiety from a few things. 

1) Neither of my parents are from an EO country so I know I wouldn't fit in to some of the hostile parishes even though I know that most to about all are not like this. 
Tbh being mixed race I'm not going to fit into any ethnic exclusive parishes.

2) I keep worrying about what would happen after I pass If I were to join the wrong church of the two churches with claims to apostolic succession. That Being the RCC or the EOC I keep on worrying that if it were to happen I would be eternally punished for not choosing the true church that christ esablished and that God wouldn't be merciful towards me.

If in the vast future (not going to happen probaly for another 500 or more years ) there was a reunion with the RCC  it would destroy this worry in a heartbeat. 

3) I'm not doing this for some girl as some people think of me. I am straight but the worst thing in the world wouldn't be to die single but to die not following the truth. I'm a pretty introverted, welcoming(from what I've been told) but it is a struggle to talk to new people for me as I am very legitimately socially awakward. So I find it very difficult to try and meet new people hence why after things get a bit more normal and the EO churches in my uni area are opening up my heart will definitely be beating heavily for my first in person divine liturgy.

4) I know that being orthodox actually requires effort as JP puts it as ""you carry your damn cross and stumble up that hill""

5) I know it's too early and I need to be a catechumen before I'm actually commiting to the church but it is that I don't want to be constantly having the idea in my mind that I had joined the wrong church.

I know I sound a bit stuck up but I am honestly worried and I hope I didn't come across as spiteful to anyone RC or EC or CofE. 
I am just confused and worried especially during this time.

Q1: Finally I just would like to know. What would be the best proof to fully put my mind at rest to reassure me that the EO church is the true apostolic church?
 
Q2: what advice would you give me for when I attend my first in person divine liturgy? 

Hope it wasn't too much to take in sorry for the wall of text. 
Hope someone sees this.

I thought I had a prayer answered,Weary_Impression7087,1605560706,"I’m not Orthodox or Christian, but I’ve been exploring for a while and I have felt like God is working on me. Anyways, I’ve been praying for a family member I’m incredibly close with who has struggled with multiple health issues for several years. Just a few weeks ago I thought my prayers were answered (and before this I’ve just become increasingly worried about their health). Brain surgery seemed to fix a complex issue they couldn’t figure out for years. I was so ecstatic and relieved and told myself I definitely have to seek God even harder and really challenge my world views.  They were on the road to recovery for several weeks and everything seemed very positive. I was thanking God everyday and telling people I thought a prayer had been answered.

Then they passed away from a heart issue that was unrelated to what the surgery had fixed. There was nothing anyone could do. I’m trying to take the Stoic approach and refrain from having an opinion about God’s role or lack of (ie not blame God etc) in this. And I’m still praying and trying to stay positive.

They had a great life so there’s a lot of good things to think about and it really does feel like they’re still with me because they really shaped who I am. But, I kinda feel like Charlie Brown getting the football pulled out from under him. It almost feels cruel, like a tease, but like I said I’m refraining from having an opinion on this and I’m still praying. I don’t know what to think though.

Please pray for their soul (I really like the idea of praying for those who’ve passed in Orthodoxy) and their family/my family. I really thought this was going to solidify I go back to being a Christian, but now I don’t know what to think. I’ve lost one of the most important people in my life.",OrthodoxChristianity

What did Paul knew about Jesus life?,radonezh,1605537932,"Today I talked with someone, who said to me that he doesn't believe the the Gospels are real, and that they are made up fairy tales. His main argument for that was that Saint Paul almost mentions nothing about Jesus earthly life. Paul talks about Christ dying, and the resurrection but not about Jesus healing people or teaching people. And I must say I was kinda surprised that that make me think about it too. I mean I definitely dont believe that the Gospels are fairy tales, I believe that God spoke through the Gospels, but it's still kinda weird that Paul doesn't mention anything about it. He should have known more shouldn't he? He was inside the community.

There is also the Lack of Citations, for example in Rom:14:14 Paul declares that there is nothing unclean in and of itself.

Help understanding St. Gregory of Nyssa,BonifaceXIII,1605500850,"In ""On Not Three Gods,"" St. Gregory responds to an argument put forward by Ablabium that because we enumerate three human persons, Peter, James, and John, as three men, we should enumerate the three divine persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as three Gods. What I find perplexing is how Gregory responds to this argument:  


&gt;  For Luke is a [**man**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm), or Stephen is a man; but it does not follow that if any one is a man he is therefore Luke or Stephen: but the idea of the [**persons**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm) admits of that separation which is made by the peculiar attributes considered in each severally, and when they are combined is presented to us by means of number; yet their nature is one, at union in itself, and an absolutely indivisible unit, not capable of increase by addition or of diminution by subtraction, but in its [**essence**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm) being and continually remaining one, inseparable even though it appear in plurality, continuous, complete, and not divided with the individuals who participate in it. And as we speak of a people, or a mob, or an army, or an assembly in the singular in every case, **while each of these is conceived as being in plurality, so according to the more accurate expression, man would be said to be one,** even though those who are exhibited to us in the same nature make up a plurality. 

St. Gregory makes an unexpected move in replying to this argument by challenging the assumption that Peter, James, and John are in fact three men, instead asserting that, because of the unity of their nature, they are in fact one man. I do not understand this at all. It seems as if he's changing the grammar we would normally use in an attempt to salvage the Trinity. It makes no sense to say that Peter, James and John are one man, because it's obvious that they are in fact three men. What motivation is there to say that Peter, James, and John are one Man instead of saying, as we normally do, in what St. Gregory calls 'a customary abuse of language,' that they are three men?",OrthodoxChristianity

What are your thoughts on this?

Related to this: it seems clear to me that there have always been two distinct theories about universal primacy/primacy as a whole in the Orthodox Church. There is the Constantinople theory, based on Canon 28 of Chalcedon, among others, which states that the Primate actually has powers and rights particular to him, and not other bishops, but always being first among equals. Then there is also the Russian theory, arguing that Patriarchs are altogether unessential for the Orthodox Church, that all bishops are essentially equal to each other, and that the Primacy is a matter of honor. I know that the first theory is not that popular, especially right now, given Ukraine and some sketchy stuff coming from the patriarch, but it seems to be the one that actually makes sense. My question then is this: if it is just a primacy of honor, with no additional authority attained to it, what is the point? Shouldn't it just be dropped altogether to avoid misunderstandings?",OrthodoxChristianity
First time visiting church during covid,Clash_The_Truth,1605483446,"For a year and a half maybe 2 year i've been on a spiritual journey. After many years of hardcore atheism I found my way towards Christianity. Long story short I started this journey out by looking into Orthodoxy but have since gone towards Catholicism, because I was already baptized and confirmed into the Catholic Church. Since than I have come to agree with the Catholic teaching of Papal supremacy. Recently I was looking into local Byzantine rite Catholic churches and came upon an Eastern Orthodox church I was considering going to when I first started my spiritual journey. Because of covid I took this as an opportunity to watch some of their liturgies on their Facebook page. I scrolled through until I found a video of a Divine Liturgy. I watched the video and felt extremely moved by the homily. So moved that I now have a deep urge to attend a liturgy at this church.

Under normal circumstances I would just show up to Sunday Liturgy, but obviously we aren't living in normal times. Because of covid the parish has a limited the amount of people allowed at liturgy, orthos, vespers, etc. To attend one of these you have to sign up online. would it be wrong of me to attend the Divine Liturgy when there is limited space? I would feel very bad if i'm taking a space from a parish member. I was also considering attending Vespers as an alternative because less people go to Vespers anyway and it's not an obligation like Sunday Liturgy. Should I just email the priest directly and ask him what is best? If I do attend the Divine Liturgy or Vespers is there anything I should know? I wasn't going to worry about following along with the Liturgy precisely, I was just going to take it all in like the first time i attended High Latin Mass. But besides that are there any specific procedures/rituals for entering the church? For example catholics cross themselves with holy water when entering the church and genuflect towards the altar/tabernacle when entering and exiting the pew.

Arguments Against Materialism?,bipsky,1605470309,"This is hopefully not going to get flagged as political, because it has more to do with philosophy and is entirely in good faith. :)

**Materialism &amp; Idealism**: *“The great basic question of all philosophy, especially of more recent philosophy, is the relation of thinking and being... spirit to Nature... which is primary, spirit or Nature.... The answers which the philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps. Those who asserted the primary of spirit to Nature and, therefore, in the last instance, assumed world creation in some form or other... comprised the camp of idealism. The others, who regarded Nature as primary, belonged to the various schools of materialism.”* — Friedrich Engels

I am an agnostic, yet I find myself attracted towards Orthodox Christianity, its art, and its ideas. One thing I am lacking in is a basis for faith. I take a lot of my world view from materialism, who believes that once the class struggle is over religion will dissipate as anxiety over oppression wanes. However, I am not entirely convinced by this, yet I am conflicted about whether materialism which seems so obvious can be argued against? 

Are Materialism and Christianity even in conflict? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have another other question tangentially related. How does somebody know if they ""choose"" or ""choose to have faith in"" the ""correct"" God(s)? From my perspective, a lot of belief comes from somebody's surroundings and what other people believe.

My parish is gradually adding a little more English to our services. We had been just scrambling to look up the troparion and kontakion each Sunday morning on someone's phone when it came up.

This was a bit of a pain so I've started printing out a couple of weeks worth at a time from [https://www.holytrinityorthodox.com/calendar/](https://www.holytrinityorthodox.com/calendar/) ; after a year we'll end up with a couple of folders with at least one troparion and kontakion for each day.

While it's not huge, there is a little bit of work in formatting everything so they look decent when printed out, so I had a look into just buying a Menaion and donating it to my parish, but both the English ones I could find are about $1200 US, which is more than I can afford at the moment.

Just the Troparia and Kontakia would be a lot smaller (and consequently cheaper) book (probably three to four small volumes instead of 12 large volumes), but I haven't been able to find one.

I looked into this because I was interested, and found out this was the same bishop who a while ago claimed women who enjoyed anal sex while they're pregnant create gay people. This furthered my skepticism I admit.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUHBTHtXPpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUHBTHtXPpQ) I think this is the one he's talking about

And in another miracle that happened really recently I found while researching this stuff, there was a picture of the same Elder Ephraim crying in Greece, and a woman had a vision of this elder. Though I can't find much sources to confirm if this was true or not.

So my question mainly is how does the church know if stuff like this is made up or not? And how does one tell one claim from a fear mongering story?

I should mention that I don't mean to offend anyone, I come out of interest. I was Catholic for a while and didn't hear much of Orthodox miracles.",OrthodoxChristianity

No confession before baptism?,Any_Veterinarian4991,1605378739,"I'm unbaptized and currently in the process of converting. Based on reading posts and interacting with others on this sub reddit, I have always thought that I would have to go and give a life confession before baptism. I was going over the details of baptism and chrismation with my priest and I brought up when confession would be. He said that if I really wanted to, or had anything serious on my mind then I could Confess if I wanted to, but  that I didn't really  need to because Baptism washes those sins away. He also said that due to 'Rona restrictions, the logistics would be weird, so I could just confess before the coming fast when everyone else does.   So, I would be baptized and  chrismated on a Saturday, and then receive Communion on the following Sunday, without Confession.

The Jesus Prayer has changed me,anotherview4,1605376329,"I had a way of framing myself as a victim in my thoughts, and when a memory would occur, the feelings were as intense as the initial event. I tried following Joel Osteen (victor and not a victim), read books and listened to sermons on forgiveness, etc. I was especially convicted by the line in the Lord's Prayer (forgive our trespasses as we have forgiven).

After attending the Orthodox Church and learning about the Jesus Prayer, I started praying for people when the memory would come - inserting their name instead of ""me."" Some people got prayed for a lot!

I'm not sure when the change took place, but I am no longer tormented by these memories. Pleasant memories have taken over. I do remember negative events, but with no emotion anymore.

I also try to chant the Jesus Prayer when bad thoughts come into my mind.

Struggling with sexual abstinence,RhodesianAlpaca,1605356916,"God bless, everyone!

I am a young Orthodox Christian student, currently living far away from home, in a relationship with a Buddhist/agnostic girl. We come from different cultures. We've been together for almost 6 months so far, and I have tried to keep myself out of sexual relations. However, for the last month and a half I have given in to the temptation.

I had talks with my parents and my elder priest about this, I decided not to do it again, but whenever I meet with my girlfriend at her place, I seem to forget what I had had in mind and as a result, I give in temptation again and have intercourse. 

I talked to her about my faith, my principles and my struggle with this temptation. She doesn't understand why it is not appropriate to have intimate relations before marriage and is not even a bit curious about why I want to do it or why I try to keep to my faith. So far, she hasn't attended any service with me. I'm praying to God that He enlightens her and helps her understand, but at the same time I have my doubts that she will ever convert before marriage.

I continue keeping the fasting times and going to church every week. Though I've noticed that my praying times have diminished. The temptation becomes very strong especially if we don't see each other for a few days.

I feel that my mind and heart are going opposite ways, which leaves me very troubled after having sex. According to my elder priest, until I can find a way out of this, I cannot have Communion any more. I feel ashamed that I always say during confession that I wish to stop, but in the end I can't get a hold of myself. At the same time, I don't want to leave my girlfriend...

The Temptation of St. Anthony in art history,12tonewalrus,1605305533,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1\_78eLjaB8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1_78eLjaB8)

 The trials of St. Anthony the Great (251-356 AD), as described in St. Athanasius's Life and the medieval Golden Legend, have been a favorite subject of Western artists since the Middle Ages. Anthony, a desert monk, was frequently assaulted by Satan, who when he could not win by normal temptations, sent his demons in the form of wild beasts, beautiful women, soldiers and even monks to torment and distract the Desert Father. 

Artists have long been fascinated with these episodes, finding in them an opportunity for the most outlandish feats of imagination. In this episode, Catholic art historian Elizabeth Lev traces the development of this artistic subject from the Middle Ages on, with special attention to the phantasmagorical work of Hieronymous Bosch. From Bosch we proceed through the intervening centuries to the modern era, where this theme was taken up again but perhaps not in the most edifying spirit. 

In this podcast (the YouTube version of which includes images of the paintings), the first 40 minutes or so are spent introducing the story of St. Anthony and examining some early medieval depictions as well as later ones which focus heavily on his traditional attributes. Then we take off with the increasingly complex depictions of Anthony's demonic trials, starting with Bosch, examine various early modern variations, and conclude with the nightmarish (yet spiritually distinct) visions of Max Ernst and Salvador Dali.

First Orthodox service done! ☑️,undulating_orange,1605230821,"Just posting here as an update and to anyone who’s interested. Here are a few things that happened when I finally had the courage to attend my first ever Orthodox service (in person). 
1. I couldn’t figure out how to get in because there were so many doors and it wasn’t angled in a way I am used to. So I caught a guy who was just getting out of the car with his 5+ kids, and I asked him to show me how to get inside. He starts immediately cracking jokes, which put me at ease, as I’m someone who loves to banter. He explained some basic stuff to me, and I felt a little more at ease when I went inside. He ended up being a choir member, and throughout the service was motioning to me subtly to help me follow along. 

2. I don’t even know how to describe the service itself. I’ve been told many times that Vespers is a simple service, but it was more elaborate than anything I’ve ever encountered as a Protestant; the only time I can think of that even vaguely compared is when my Baptist church put a little extra effort into the Christmas service by giving everyone a candle when they walked in (ironic, huh....). The lit lamps, the burning candles in the corner, the gates, the PHYSICAL MOTION of the parishioners (im used to sitting, standing, and maybe lifting a hand during worship if you’re being extra)...I’m not an emotional person at all but I found myself getting a little choked up. But somehow, the grandeur of the decor and chanting was subtly undercut by the humanity of it all; the crack in a choir members voice every so often, the little kids making the sign of the cross and then sprinting helter skelter across the floor in the most somber moments, the old people sitting for moments to rest. I really got a sense of humanity joining with divinity and the uniquely Orthodox POV of humanity as something that is to be saved rather than trampled or belittled, the flesh as a tool of salvation and whatnot, really became real to me. At certain points, out of nowhere, I distinctly got the feeling of sitting around a campfire with family. Cant explain it, but thats what I can compare it to

3. After the service the choir member I met accompanied me to a class about confession taught by the priest I emailed before attending; the priest himself was humble and funny, and didn’t try to force anything on me. It’s like he was letting the faith speak for itself, which is uncommon in the evangelical circles I grew up in. Both the priest and choir member asked me about my life and journey in general, and seemed very attentive and interested. The priest’s class was interesting and well taught, and I could tell he was throwing in some extra general Orthodox info for me since I was the only new person. He also spoke directly to a problem I’ve been having; I’m not sure how he even got on the subject from his original point, but it spoke deeply to me and was scarily in line with what I’ve been struggling with. 

Sorry for the long post; next up is a Divine Liturgy, which I am still a little nervous for but less so than before. Glory to God, because without knowing this would happen, I walked in and felt at home.",OrthodoxChristianity
Answers to frequently asked questions (my view),Classic_Result,1605229632,"1. Ask your priest/bishop. Not because you're stupid or you're reading bad books or websites, but because Orthodox Christianity is a live thing, a lived thing. You're not just looking for information but how to be in a right relationship with God and the Church. That means real relationships with real people.

2. Go back to confession, receive communion, confess and commune regularly. That covers most cases of what people should do if they lapsed.

3. If you're not Orthodox, become Orthodox. Not meaning to be cheeky, this covers most inquiries about how different denominations and traditions should get along. We're missing you. It hurts.

4. Yes, you should fast, but see answer number 1. Any questions, line it up with YOUR priest in YOUR area. Here it's possible to compare different local phenomena, but you have to go to YOUR local people to get what you should do.

5. Do for yourself what everyone should do, and after that don't worry about it. Obsessions and compulsive worrying are separate issues. Not worrying is how you're still around to go to the next level. If you worry too much you'll give up.

6. Your information on the Church canons is probably right, for all I know. Start with the basics about what you should do, and then see what's next. The canons are worth studying and being conversant in, but the canons are what priests use to determine what they should tell you. The canons are no good without priests and bishops to interpret and apply them. Even then they get it wrong or make politically motivated decisions. Don't start and stop with the canons. See answer number 1.

It function is twofold, in that I hope it can provide enough (anonymous) insight into my desire to convert, while also providing a forum -- discursive as it may be -- for me to type out some of what I have been wrestling with.   


As an undergraduate, I was active in the Episcopal Church and had ambitions of seeking ordination in that tradition. However, due to myriad confessional differences within the Episcopal polity at large, I found myself disillusioned with the Creedal proclamations of the faith, as it seemed to be a tradition whose understanding of 'creed' was increasingly elusive. Through a continual study of theology and the attraction of Word on Fire Catholic ministries, I found myself warming to the idea of Roman Catholicism, because I found its claims of continuity convincing and coherent, as compared to the Episcopal tradition. Moreover, it fostered a similar, albeit fuller, liturgical expression similar to high-church Anglicanism. Swimming the Tiber, thus, was not so difficult. My wife and I enrolled in a local parish RCIA program and were confirmed at the Easter Vigil.   


After graduating college and getting married, I began to pursue an MTS from a Catholic University where I was introduced to a more comprehensive study of the Christian East. The professor that introduced me to Eastern Patrology is a Roman Catholic priest and a true man of God. He noticed how taken I was with his course and became both an academic advisor and spiritual counselor. Not only did he introduce me to the Jesus Prayer, but gave advice and instruction on how to foster contemplation and 'pray without ceasing.' 

Given my interest in Eastern Patrology, my wife and I did some research and sought to attend a Ruthenian Catholic parish. We both fell in love with the beauty of the liturgy and the devotion we witnessed in our fellow parishioners. Happily, we found a spiritual home and had a spiritual father. Our parish, mostly immigrants, is definitely on the more Orthodox side of the Byzantine Catholic tradition. We were, I believe, one of two Roman Catholic families that belonged to the parish-- To this, I will return. My priest instructed us to read, while never a formal body, Orthodox catechisms and had a great relationship with surrounding Orthodox clergy.   


Perhaps, I would not be writing this had COVID-19 not affected us. The pandemic hit, our parish stopped liturgy, and my wife lost employment. On top of this, we had recently discovered that we were pregnant! (He is here now and is beautiful!!!) The university announced that, in the final months of our semester and out of an abundance of caution, we were going to finish online. My parents saw the stress of our situation and offered for us to live with them amidst all of the ongoing uncertainty.   


So we moved back home and we remain grateful for their support. As the pandemic moved on and began to take certain shapes that could be, in some sense, understood, parishes began to offer liturgies with considered safety measures. I knew, from talking to my priest in our previous parish, that there was a Byzantine Church relatively close to where my parents lived. Thus, I reached out to the rector of that parish and inquired about attending liturgy.   


The experience at this parish was vastly different from our parish before we moved. This parish was heavily 'latinized,' in that it was comprised heavily of Roman Catholics that came to a Byzantine liturgy -- including a Catholic celebrity. And, without moving to a posture of judgment, it all just seemed disingenuous. I could not shake that it all felt like a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too sort of thing. These people came, from what I gathered, because they had a contempt or incredulity towards the Latin Rite. They wanted something ancient and beautiful, which is of course laudable. However, seems fundamentally Protestant. That is, the notion that a local parish does not do liturgy the way I want it done, so I am going to search out for pretty liturgy and make sure I have it my way. This carries with it, also, too heavy a reliance on the particularities of continuity. ""We want to be Thomists, while also revering Palamas."" The whole thing just felt dissonant.   


Because of this, I decided I would stay where I began in the Catholic Church: At the closest Latin parish. However, my spiritual life has felt hollow. My wife and I do not pray as we used to. I have not been reading Scripture and spiritual works with devotion, if at all. I am an academic theologian that writes and presents on figures from the East, but find myself no longer looking at my academic work as an extension of holiness and a life of prayer. It's just work!   


All this background to say, I feel closest to Christ when I live my life in-tuned with what could be called 'Orthodox' practices: Sticking to a prayer rule, trying to foster contemplation, and of course, attending Vespers and the Divine Liturgy. Yet I am hesitant to allow myself to attend a Byzantine parish, because, as I mentioned, it feels a bit disingenuous (at least, my experience at the Parish near my parents).   


And so, my wife and I are in a bind. We both are open to Orthodoxy. We have deep affection for all that was mentioned, but too, love that the greatest defense of the Orthodox faith is the Divine Liturgy. One does not find manualism and neat apologetics in the Orthodox faith. They find a mystical encounter with the Triune God.   


What holds me back -- and I hate to say it -- is fear of hell. I understand that this might be silly to some, but I cannot shake the voice inside of me that tells to worry about to worry about 'losing my ticket' if I inquire further and eventually become Orthodox. I know this is a rubbish way of looking at things and certainly far less inclusive than I am in my approach to looking at salvation in others, but in the spirit of transparency, it is much harder to be merciful to myself than it is to my neighbor, which is pride I suppose!   


Can anyone speak to that fear? The fear of losing 'truth' by seeking Orthodoxy?   


Thank you!",OrthodoxChristianity

A dilemma.,Dimitripapa,1605043597,"For about two months now I have been discussing Islam on Facebook with many Muslims. I also like to talk with people. However, my dilemma is that I can't stop for some reason, I find my faith in Christianity shaken sometimes, but others I feel it getting stronger (like now). I feel like I've dug myself a whole, but there's a reason God lets this happen, I believe. 

Once, I was on a chat room where it's one on one and you ask about Islam. I did a bad thing. I lied that I believed in Islam and just wanted to see what would happen, what the procedure would be. There was only an email saying congratulations. However, I didn't believe and afterwards I felt very sad and full of anxiety because I felt that I had thrown my faith in Orthodox Christianity away. I still have residual sadness about it. I am not a Muslim, I keep telling myself because I didn't believe it all. I believe in God (which is Allah in Arabic, but in my head I was thinking about the Christian definition of God. I do believe in the Prophet's but not in Muhammad. It was only by text this conversation. No audio. I did read the shahada in my mind, but not out of complete belief (I do believe in God, although I know they've got a complete different view on Him). This was all by text, as I said earlier in the post. I feel depressed because I feel like I would have to get re-baptised. I'm even scared to go and receive communion in case I am not deemed Christian and I've heard of a case where a non-Christian received it where he/she immediately fell down and died. So, yeah. Quite shaken up. 

I do like talking to people and I have, for the most part, at least, stayed firm in Orthodox Christianity, but I feel like I have dug myself into a large hole. 

Please forgive my long post.

Ethnocentrism in Orthodoxy and why don't we just have one Orthodox Church?,FreeKhajiit,1605039493,"I get it, technically the Greek, Russian, Serbian etc. Churches are all part of the same Orthodox Church. I get that they often formed this way so The Gospel could be preached in the language that people actually spoke in that area instead of trying to impose something on them. 

I get that in these particular countries, it works for the people living there, and I guess it works well enough for the diaspora in other countries. 

As an American who isn't any of these though, I'd be lying if I said the congregation, even clergy, never gave me any odd looks or questions walking into a Greek Orthodox church. Everything from the food, language, etc. is pretty much entirely centered around Greece. I'd imagine Russian, Serbian, and other Orthodox churches are pretty similar. 

Which, again, I guess for immigrants from these areas is great and they can settle right in. For converts it makes an already complex and confusing thing all the more difficult to navigate, and feels like they're being left out in the cold by a group defining itself as *not being them,* not even letting them take Communion initially, and sometimes taking a while to warm up to or approach them in general. 

If Jesus is meant for everyone, why put up, or at least insist on maintaining, these barriers, over possibly some of the dumbest and arbitrary things to distinguish yourself by, (at least in a religious sense)? 

When we say the Nicene Creed, we pray for *One* Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. It doesn't say anything about any specific nation being involved. Pardon the rant, but it just seems like Orthodoxy can't, or worse yet doesn't even want to, unify *itself.* Nevermind Catholics, Protestants, and all the other Christians out there.

 Maybe I'm wrong, but I've never in my life heard of an Orthodox mission trip before, so I'm guessing reaching out to other religions is probably out of the question.

I just find it all so.....silly. Why can't we just have one Orthodox Church without all the caveats and call it a day?",OrthodoxChristianity

Apparently the Charismatic movement in growing rapidly, and most of the people joining are women. Having previously been a part of Charismatic churches I can see why it's so appealing.

Orthodox study bible says Jesus had gentile blood in Matthew,waffle65g,1604988693,"After the genealogy of Jesus it says he had both Jew and Gentile in his blood and I'm trying to figure out who of these is gentile?

The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:
2
Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.
3
Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Ram.
4
Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon.
5
Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,
6
and Jesse begot David the king. David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.
7
Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa.
8
Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah.
9
Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah.
10
Hezekiah begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.
11
Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers about the time they were carried away to Babylon.
12
And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel.
13
Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor.
14
Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud.
15
Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob.
16
And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.
17
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ are fourteen generations.
18
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
19
Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.
20
But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
21
And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.”
22
So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
23
“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel, which is translated, ‘God with us.’”
24
Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,
25
and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name JESUS.",OrthodoxChristianity

So this leads me to some of the questions I've been having recently. Something else I've learned is the Protestant stance on Solo Scriptura. I'm aware that Protestantism arose from the Western Church not the Eastern due to various concerns - one of which being on the basis of authority. Protestants say only scripture while Roman Catholics (to the best of my knowledge) hold both Sacred Tradition and Scripture as authoritative. I guess my question for you all does Orthodoxy teach the same doctrine? Also does anyone have any recommendations for reading subjects on the matter?

Some questions on the basis of chrismation,MarysDowry,1604967497,"I've had some thoughts on chrismation that I'd like to get others thoughts on, I am struggling to see the basis for chrismation as a universal necessity.

OCA says:

""In the sacrament of Chrismation we receive “the seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit”. If baptism is our personal participation in Easter—the death and resurrection of Christ, then chrismation is our personal participation in Pentecost—the coming of the Holy Spirit upon us.

The sacrament of chrismation, also called confirmation, is always done in the Orthodox Church together with baptism. Just as Easter has no meaning for the world without Pentecost, so baptism has no meaning for the Christian without chrismation.""

""In chrismation a person is given the “power from on high”, the gift of the Spirit of God, in order to live the new life received in baptism.""

In general the proof-texts of chrismation seem to be:

Acts 19:

‘While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples and asked them, ‘Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?’ They answered, ‘No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.’ So Paul asked, ‘Then what baptism did you receive?’ ‘John’s baptism,’ they replied. Paul said, ‘John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.’ On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.""

Acts 8:

""When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.""

The problem I have is that the NT seems to give a range of orders, so the laying on of hands (from what I can tell, anointing is never mentioned) isn't always presented as the cause of the spirits descent.

Take for example in Acts 10, the gentiles have the gifts of the spirit poured onto them **before** they are even baptised. 

""While Peter is yet speaking these sayings, the Holy spirit fell upon all those hearing the word, and those of the circumcision believing were astonished -- as many as came with Peter -- because also upon the nations the gift of the Holy Spirit hath been poured out, for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and magnifying God. Then answered Peter, The water is any one able to forbid, that these may not be baptized, who the Holy Spirit did receive -- even as also we?' he commanded them also to be baptized in the name of the Lord; then they besought him to remain certain days."" 

You could argue that this was a breaking of the rules for a specific purpose, I don't see how relevant that would be though. The believers were given the spirit simply for hearing and believing, without any baptism and certainly without any laying on of hands.

Paul himself was given the spirit before baptism, by the laying on of hands. 

The NT outside of Acts seems to be entirely silent on any kind of anointing being necessary for reception of the spirit, just belief and baptism. 

It also brings up the question of those outside the church, are we to say that everyone baptised outside of Orthodoxy has been devoid of the indwelling of the spirit? If the spirit can dwell in those outside the Orthodox communion simply through belief and baptism, then chrismation is not necessary. 

If its the laying on of hands which imparted the spirit in some cases, why use oil? If the oil is a vehicle for the bishops own action, why not just skip the middleman of the oil and impart the grace directly to the priest to do the laying on of hands?

I am struggling to see how chrismation is actually necessary biblically speaking.",OrthodoxChristianity

Best criticism of Fr. John Romanides' historiography?,teawar,1604958860,"I've been re-reading Romanides lately. I could never get too far into his works because his ""Orthodox Roman vs. Frankish Heretic"" dichotomy always rubbed me the wrong way as a student of history because it sounds so overly simplistic and broad. I'm more or less skimming those parts of his writing and focusing more on his ideas about being and metaphysics and apophatic language, which are far more interesting. 

Nevertheless, is there any place I can read a good criticism of his strikingly anti-Western view of church history? I know DBH (who I'm not a big fan of) simply dismisses him as an all-around crank, but I don't think that's fair.",OrthodoxChristianity
"What is the difference between Znamenny Chant, Kievan Chant, Obikhod, and Prostopinije?",byzvntine,1604955450,"I know that Prostopinije is the chant used in the Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Church, but I'm not sure how to identify the others from one another. I know Znamenny chant is older, but what, for example, is the chant used in the OCA/Antiochian jurisdictions? Can someone give me a good cheat sheet so I can know the differences?

Interestingly enough, if you search ""Byzantine Catholic"" on Spotify, you'll find the Choir of Annunciation Byzantine Catholic Church. If you listen to the music though, absolutely none of it is what you hear in a Byzantine Catholic liturgy (as in Ruthenian), because that is more along the lines of Prostopinije. But I had no idea about these differences until I attended Byzantine Catholic/Orthodox liturgies at different parishes/jurisdictions and saw the differences.

I finally understand THE ONE TRUE CHURCH.

Burning with Passion (Lust) what shall I do?,RevenueResident9431,1604875974,"Hello. This is a post and more of a cry for help. I am burning with lust, it never ceases.. while awake and even in my sleep. I can never seem to have a pure heart and mind. My body feels like its burning with lust. Each week I come to church and feel like I'm crawling into church feeling like I got beat down. I just don't even know what to do anymore, this is unlike anything I have experienced. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not viewing explicit material, neither I am not committing acts of self-destruction. It has gotten to the point I can no longer be in the same room as a woman without my thoughts turning to rot. I fast, I pray the prayers of purity but my mind still turns to rot.. this is a struggle that I feel like I am grasping for air hoping I don't crash and burn.

&amp;#x200B;

What shall I do? my life in every metric is suffering because of it.. I am living alone and I only interact with people 2 times a week (Saturday at Church and Sunday morning at church) I don't have any friends and I never have. Ive been a lone wolf my whole life, I am not a cool person or someone that people want to know but I have accepted this willingly. (This has been throughout my whole life, never really has changed). I believe this new challenge of lust is because this year is my first time truly living by myself.. other than leaving for groceries I do not interact with a human (in person) 5/7 of the week.

&amp;#x200B;

Trouble with psalters,Bedesman,1604871441,"Hi all:

I’m just looking to register opinions to help inform my choices. I’m getting back into the habit of praying the psalms, but I’m having difficulty choosing a version. Here are my three options:

1) Coverdale (1928/1662) 
-Pros: it’s beautiful, familiar, and it breaks the psalter out into a monthly cycle.
-Cons: it’s not LXX so I often feel “guilty” while praying it. 

2) HTM (Boston) Psalter 
-Pros: LXX translation in a compact format with the best paper and nice little pieces of sacred art.
-Cons: the translation is just plain ugly and unnecessarily pedantic (“chant” is used instead of “singing”, etc.). The base text is the Douay-Rheims psalter and they should’ve just stuck closely to it instead of adding their own weird renderings.

3) Psalter for Prayer (Jordanville)
-Pros: LXX translation that is not as weird as the HTM; truly pocket size with nice ribbons and additional devotional content.
-Cons: the translation unnecessarily changes Coverdale when Coverdale doesn’t differ with the LXX; the don’t is bad and the acrostics are not well-done in certain psalms; honestly, the physical book is an aesthetic nightmare.

He destroyed it, I destroyed 2 things in ny possession as well that are not necessarily demonic like voodoo, but are not Christian in origin just to be safe. 

Well the paranormal stuff hasn't stopped and I've been trying to reach out to priests for a month. Nobody picks up the phone no matter what time of day or no matter what day of the week, including today the lords day. And in general they never answer emails. 

So my question is what am I supposed to do if the priests can't help me? At this point if I see the demon I'll fight him cuz I'm getting tired of this.

I had chronic diarrhea for about 4 years due to an untreated infection from 15 to 18 years old. I was barely eating and skipped most meals, I had a complete loss of appetite and I didn’t feel hungry at all. I usually had one meal per day.

I didn’t seek medication until the condition became unbearable ( very painful with lots of diarrhea per day) in the fourth year of my disease.

I did a stool analysis and there was Entamoeba Histolytica with Undigested food. so I ate very little, had malabsorption and diarrhea.

I went to an endocrine doctor and he measured my wingspan and said that my vertical height is 10 cm shorter than it should be for the right proportions.

I did an X-ray on my knees and all my growth plates have fused which means that I won't grow taller anymore. I wasn't into sports or literally, any physical activity was very very inactive through my teenage years, stayed at home playing video games all day.

So I was sitting on my chair all the time not doing any physical activity although I knew I was the shortest among my friends, I didn't care back then and now, I regret not doing stretching exercises or trying to eat more. I truly think I stunted my growth with my horrible lifestyle, I am way shorter than my dad.

I think that this period may be more difficult than Lent as the feasting for Christmas is now a month long. 

 For example, for Thanksgiving we normally cook a large turkey and plan meals around the meat and make stock from the bones. But, as we will now be in fast period we thought about having salmon instead. I'll also have to navigate making vegan Christmas cookies (because I'm not saintly enough to make cookies I can't have) and other non fast holiday foods. This is my first time celebrating Christmas  at Christmas and not the entire month before. I've always hung decorations up in early December and the live trees are all gone by the week of Christmas.  

I've started by working on some recipes from the Vegan Greek to expand my fast-friendly menu so that I have fewer cooking disasters when the fast is truly on.

I have a question regarding the following verses:

Hoping for some Help,APinchOfSugarAndSalt,1604500595,"**TL;DR:  Why believe?  What is the value of Orthodoxy?  What is its purpose?  What does it provide that cannot be found elsewhere?  Why remain Orthodox?**

Hello there.  I made a previous post on this topic, but I've never been good at communicating, so it didn't pan out as I was hoping.

I've been Orthodox for a variety of reasons over these few years, but over time, I've settled on a sort of pragmatism, a vague notion that the truth could be known by its fruits.  There is a lot of beauty and wisdom in the Orthodox way of life, more than in most, as far as I'm aware.  The problem is, I've been finding it increasingly more difficult to convince myself that there’s really anything all that special about it practically.

I don't care about having some ""nice feelings"" or ""spiritual experiences,"" there lie only delusion, prelest.  I just want to find peace, joy, fulfillment.  Yet when I compare my experiences and those of other Orthodox against those outside, I don't see much difference in this regard.  We all muddle through life, through highs and lows, going too far in one direction or another and getting burned.  Often, those outside seem to be doing just as well or poorly, sometimes better, despite living contrary to some of the Orthodox teachings.

Why not simply take what works and distill things down to what is helpful on a case by case basis?  Maybe the “package-deal” is a good fit for some, but not something worth defending or evangelizing as a whole.  Plenty of people have gone down that modern route, and there found peace, joy, and fulfillment.  Sure, many go too far in one direction or another and get burned, but it happens in Orthodoxy as well, and it isn't like there’s anything other than one group’s word against another to  support the Orthodox position.  In fact, some of the Orthodox moral teachings are especially hard to justify in the face of personal experiences and data, specifically those regarding peculiar expressions of love.  I don't know how to defend what I cannot justify, nor how to believe what I cannot defend.  I do not want to live in delusion, in empty self-righteousness, in *""prelest.""*",OrthodoxChristianity

If it is that ancestral sin is hereditary because we live in a dangerous world outside of Paradise... why did God let Adam's children live outside of Paradise at all? Why didn't He simply let Adam's curse be only his own problem (as Jews believe) and then bring Cain and Abel back into Paradise?

The Jewish and Islamic view that Adam was going to die regardless seems to make more sense to me. Otherwise, by making death and exile a burden that was added onto Adam because of his sin, then it is deeply unjust of God that we must also carry this burden even without having sinned, and it contradicts the scriptures.",OrthodoxChristianity

Funny Spiritual Father Stories,tradbro1,1604381709,"Does anyone have any funny stories of interaction with their spiritual father or priest?  

I have a few that were funny in that they were humbling of my pride and judgmental nature.

1.  A local mainline Protestant church (they are prone to extreme modernism, including secular theological heresies like denying the Virgin Birth, etc. for those unaware) was hosting a Muslim congregation in its social hall for prayer, and I complained to my spiritual father about how it is offensive to host people who will preach heresy in a church.  He replied: ""Muslims probably have a higher Christology than the Episcopalians do, so you should thank God for improving the worthiness of the preaching in that building.""  That was a humbling response! 

2. Another time, I was complaining (of course!) about Roman Catholicism for some reason or other, and my spiritual father responded: ""The Pope of Rome is a canonical Patriarch, who does have primacy over the others.  Canonically there is little difference between us and the Roman Church, especially as compared with the non-Chalcedonians.""  Humbled again!",OrthodoxChristianity

At first, I just went along with it because cases were practically non existent in my area, but now cases are rising. I’ve been going up until this point. Last week I wore a mask and didn’t take communion. This week I didn’t go at all. I don’t know if this is the right decision or not.

2. The iOS app constantly crashes; even if you uninstall and reinstall.

3. There’s no longer any sort of “swipe” feature; so to match with someone you have to like them in a way that notifies them. This makes it impossible to match with people you know without telling them you’re interested.

4. Cancelling your subscription is not made user-friendly. It requires you to email them, rather than integrating it into the app.

Modern pronunciation of ancient Koinh texts: Plural pronouns – distinguishing first and second person,awxdvrgyn,1604192279,"I'm a first year Koine Greek student at seminary and I've been doing a bit of scripture memorisation and trying to learn it in modern pronunciation, so at least I can recite it / hear it from fellow believers

| ἡμῶν | ὑμῶν |
| ἡμῖν | ὑμῖν |
| ἡμᾶς | ὑμᾶς |

In restored koine, ἡμεῖς, ὑμεῖς are pronounced /e.'mis/ and /u.'mis/ (emis, umis) respectively, and modern derivatives of erasmian are /he.'mes/, /hu.'mes/ (hēmeis, humeis).

But if I am correct, in modern greek the pronunciation is typically /i.'mis/ (imis) for both (where i is the **ee** in 'n**ee**d', which I believe υ, η, ι, ει all produce the same sound)

Order of sacraments after baptism?,WearyCriticism100,1604188159,"Hello all,

I've been a lurker here for a while, but this is my first post!

I'm currently a catechumen preparing for baptism (GOARCH). I haven't been baptized before, and I'm greatly looking forward to it! 

I talked with my priest to specifically ask about what he expects for a life confession, and he essentially said that he doesn't expect or want anything detailed. After my baptism, he said, we'll meet for confession and talk about sinful habits and patterns I've developed over my life, and then I'd be absolved and allowed to commune. I left feeling well about that, but as I've thought more about it I feel like I'm more confused than I was before, lol. 

Is this the norm? If baptism is for the remission of sins, why would my priest want to do the confession AFTER I've already been baptized and before I commune? It seems redundant, and implies that the grace of baptism is contingent on a confession afterward, if I'm not allowed to commune until I've confessed even though I was just baptized. Perhaps I'm overthinking it, but I feels weird to me. It seems like it would make more sense to do a lifetime confession as a way to prepare for reception into the church, not after I've already been baptized. 

Also, I've heard conflicting things about whether the life confession is sacramental or not. The consensus seems to be that the life confession is not canonically required and is not sacramental, but has become tradition as a way for the priest to develop a better relationship with the new convert. The sins are forgiven through the converts baptism and faith in Christ, regardless of the life confession that the priest may or may not even require the convert to do. Is this correct? 

I suffer from severe scrupulosity as well as clinical OCD, so I tend to have a really hard time with these things. I've discussed with my priest, who is a great man, but like I said before, some of these conversations I've had with him have made me even more confused lol. I want to make sure I do this right. The last thing I need is to feel like my baptism isn't valid because I did a life confession wrong.",OrthodoxChristianity

"My Thoughts on ""The Gurus, the Young Man, and Elder Paisios""",SSPXarecatholic,1604181944,"I finished this book today, and even before then intended to write something about it because I just had to get feedback from others. Let me begin by saying ***I enjoyed this book a great deal***. Spiritual biographics are interesting and shed a lot of light in where I am in my own spiritual journey. One of the great benefits of reading from someone else's experience is that you can ideally avoid making the same mistakes they did, and can pick up habits that were beneficial for them. That said, while I enjoyed this book, it did leave me with a sense of disappointment for what it could have been, that is: an open, honest appraisal of Hinduism, it's beauty and nuances it's eternal truths but also it's many flaws and how we can hope to harmonize the true, good, and beautiful we find there with Orthodoxy.

**A Lack of Nuance**

The biggest issue stems from the author's either ignorance or lack of desire to actually try and depict a normal healthy picture of Hinduism as your average Hindu experiences. This is largely due to his treatment of Hinduism as if it were a monolithic religion or spiritual practice. His visit to the various Ashrams are all mostly, if not exclusively, teaching either Kriya or Hatha yoga (and mostly in their more modern psychoanalytical forms). His view seems to be that Hinduism as a whole practices yoga as it's principle spiritual exercise. The author's seeming lack of depth regarding Hinduism really works to undercut his thesis that Hinduism is an entirely demonic spiritual practice, because, how can we know whether he's even a reliable critic? The total lack of nuance of the massive complexities present within Hinduism with it's myriad schools, philosophies, practices, sacraments, and liturgies makes it hard to read when his generalizations simply don't capture the complexity of this spiritual vast tradition.

**Spiritual Immaturity: Dualities and Dialectics Abound**

Another quality that makes this book difficult to read is tightly related to my first point. Because the author lacks a sense of nuance concerning the Hindu tradition he consistently, from start to finish, casts every situation he finds himself in in terms of a dualistic dialectic. His discussions with the Elder conclude with ""You are either with God or with the Devil"" (concerning Orthodoxy versus Hinduism). His spiritual immaturity shows when he lists a number of far eastern thinkers, including Buddha and Lao Tzu, and concludes 

&gt;Was it possible for all these wise and learned men with such knowledge of the world and society to have made so great a mistake, and for me to have discovered a truth of which they were ignorant?

This is peak sophomoric jubilation. ""AHA! You see, I above all my ancestors have found Truth, and have grasped it betwixt my hands and towering intellect. ""One finds these sentiments repeated over and over again. He sets up a system in which his intuitions and experiences of the divine and of goodness are genuine but those of others are simply ruled out. Even after coming through the lions den and settling on Orthodoxy the spiritual immaturity when dealing with others becomes so plain to see. You can almost see his ego trying to defend itself as he laments the lack of illumination of others like when he speaks to his friend who is still into the occult

&gt;I told him, ""I visited the Monastery of St. Nectarios. That place is filled with energy. You should go and check it out for yourself.""  
&gt;  
&gt;He replied by saying, ""No way. I'm not going there. It's not my style. It's the opposite of where my soul leans. I just don't like that place–I find it repulsive.""  
&gt;  
&gt;I was both surprised and deeply saddened. How could there be people who felt like that? How could they dislike the grace of God so bluntly and categorically? I had felt such joy and peace in the saint's presence. *He must, I thought, speak this was out of ignorance.*

That last line really did it for me. He accepts his own intuitions as being divinely given gifts and concludes that those who deviate must be either ignorant or under demonic delusion, and yet I am sure many of lovely Hindus would describe their own spiritual experiences in quite the same way: full of joy, peace, and the divine presence. He never deals with this. He simply assumes that his own intuitions are infallible and condescends to those who do not share such experiences.

The author's views of how gullible and silly these followers of these gurus are made me chuckle because when looked at from the reader's perspective I immediately saw that the way these disciples treated their gurus was nowhere near the way the author treats, views, and esteems Elder Paisios. The author thought it foolish to ask the Babaji for favors through prayers or supplications, and held this view in general about the gurus he was with. And yet, a great stroke of irony arises that he seems to be totally ignorant of. When under spiritual attack he calls upon Elder Paisios' name asking for his help! Saying

&gt;""Elder, help me."" Instantly, even before I could realize what was happening, I felt another force surge up within me and rebuild my soul, making it sturdier than it was before.

The deeper irony arises when he does call out to Babaji and describes a darkness descend upon him, and when he relays this to a woman at the Ashram in which he resided, she says ""Babaji wanted to show you the darkness in your mind"", to which he then thinks ""I knew full well that the darkness had not been my own."" I even wrote a note down in the margin saying

&gt;How do you know that though \[that it was not Babaji showing you the darkness of your mind\]? If the Elder did this you would take it as an opportunity to reflect and repent. A moment to recognize your ignorance in light of the vastness of God.

For someone who consistently is wary of ""guruism"" his own treatment of the Elder is just as if not *more* extreme than the way some of these disciples treat their gurus.

**Prelest**

Much of this book surrounds spiritual experiences, where the author claims to have very overt and serious encounters with the spiritual world. Before he starts to really look at Christianity seriously he already has experienced a great deal of spiritual manifestation that would soften the heart of even the most hardened atheist/materialist. In India, his descriptions of demonic influence, and dark powers are deeply tangible. While I am certainly aware that there are some very sensitive people out there it makes me question even how reliable his encounters of the divine from Christ or our Lady are. Again, he assumes that his experience in India was demonic, mostly, it seems because of what the Elder told him, but he never stops to question whether his encounter with various lights and other spiritual manifestations that he simply accepts as being divine and good on Mount Athos are actually that. It's strange to read because in India every spiritual encounter is colored already by his distaste for polytheism and his view that it is demonic. While he claims to have gone with a ""neutral perspective"", if such a thing exists and which he symbolized by taking his cross that the Elder gave him off, his ignorance and narrow-mindedness seem to serve only to prove the original claim that Orthodoxy is de facto divine, while Hinduism and all other eastern religions are demonic.

**What I liked**

And now to the good stuff. There is a lot of it! While the book is bogged down in other areas, the author provides some real moments of genuine spiritual maturity, growth, and awareness, with a lucidity that was refreshing and emotional to read. I'll just drop some highlighted quotes I found to be really memorable.

At Elder Paisios' blessing

&gt;He then placed his hands on my head and momentarily lifted up his eyes to heaven. I was flooded by a spiritual torrent. I felt such a fullness of life and light, of peace and joy, that it took my breath away. Words are insufficient to express what I felt: *it was beyond all measurement and comparison.* (Emphasis mine)

Father Paisios' wisdom (brought a tear to my eye)

&gt;Man is worthy of being loved just because he's in the image of God. it doesn't matter at all if he's good or bad, moral or sinful. Man is worthy of being loved for what he is. Christ loved and sacrificed himself for sinful, corrupt people.

The Author's own words of wisdom

&gt;Because He loved me, He allowed me to approach Him, and He purified me and healed me, thoroughly and deeply, of all my pains and sores. He drew me gently, steadily, and safely from darkness to light, from filth to purity, from non-being into being. He granted me a more intense, true, and vital existence, not because He had need of me, but because *He is love.* (Emphasis mine)

Authorial wisdom 2

&gt;Man takes one step, and God responds with a thousand in order to bridge the gap. Nevertheless, man's small and insignificant step in God's direction is absolutely crucial, because it reveals man's intention and good disposition, giving God the ""right"" to approach him, without infringing his spiritual freedom

Authorial wisdom 3

&gt;Mercy contains all things. Love, forgiveness, healing, restoration, and repentance all fit within the word ""mercy."" It is the mercy of God that brings about repentance, purification from the passions, the illumination of the nous and, in the end, theosis.

The Author after really *understanding* that God is ""everywhere present and filling all things""

&gt;It was as though someone lifted a veil from my mind, enabling my soul to live, *not in a different world, but in the same world–the same world in it's entirety.* (Emphasis mine)

Someone ends up in the ER on their way to sign a deed, mail gets sent to the wrong address, someone backs out, etc. 

We are now at the last step, waiting on word from the County on if we will get the property or not. I went there one day to pray, and a neighbor came and asked me who I was. When I explained we were trying to buy the property, she said to be careful because the people who lived there last did a lot of witchcraft. I've had a sense something spiritual was going on, but as soon as she said that things made a lot more sense. Like maybe something is trying to prevent us from moving in. 

Our priest said he can come bless the property, but not until the 18th due to busy schedules. In the meantime, are there any prayers or things I can do to clear out any negative energy or negative spirits tied to the house/land? I've tried fasting, akathists, prostrations, sprinkling holy water at the property, and even a little holy oil on the door post of the house.

I had to leave RCIA over Pope Francis' recent comments on homosexuality and civil unions,January1st2020AD,1604032006,"Hello All,

Little about me: I'm a former evangelical who grew tired of the wishy-washy nature of modern Americanized Christianity. Over the past almost 5 years, I've been studying the history of the faith and this culminated with me entering RCIA this year. I recently left after hearing Pope Francis' comments on civil unions and homosexuality. After further research, I'll give the Pope the benefit of the doubt in that he was most likely taken out of context, and his words are now being used by the secular world to mean something he did not intend. Even so, the mere fact that 1) The Pope has not seen fit to unequivocally clarify his statements and 2) The fact that the Pope would even comment on the subject at all - without calling homosexuals to repentance - troubles me. 

Additionally, there were doctrines I was already uncomfortable with in Roman Catholicism - specifically papal infallibility, Marian apparitions (not the dogmas), purported saintly miracles (stigmata, etc), and the fact that, over time, I feel like the ""Ecumenical Councils"" became less and less, well, ecumenical. I don't have much experience with Orthodoxy outside of a brief interaction with a church's website in my city, an episode of Ten Minute Bible Hour, and listening to Hank Hanegraaff's podcast and conversion story. But, I am willing to learn more. 

Are there any former Catholics in this group who left Rome? If so, why? Any for Protestants - particularly evangelicals - who became Orthodox? I am looking for the true roots of my faith - the faith instituted by Christ - this process has been long, arduous, and quite tiring. But I don't want to give up.

Overlap between Eastern Orthodoxy Apophatism and Death of God theology?,traxets,1604005423,"Hello everyone,

Been a lurker for a while. But would love to learn more about any overlap, or comparisons or contrasts between Eastern Orthodox Apophatism and DoG Theology. I grew up evangelical and authors like Peter Rollins were instrumental in a faith deconstruction. However, I've also been reading into eastern orthodoxy and realizing that a lot of the apophatism is almost the same thing but in pre-enlightenment language. I've been reading Christ The Eternal Tao right now and am loving it. Is EOA more the same thing within an idealist framework, and DoG more the same thing within a materialist framework?

I am someone who feels like I have ""been through"" DoG theology. Now on the other side, I really like the EOA style writings. In the sense that after the idolatry of God has been dealt with. The language that is used to describe God has a very thoughtful balance of pointing to God, while also stirring mystery in the believer. Curious if that is a weird mashup or if that is welcome here.

November is the Month for praying for the souls in Purgatory.,AugustBernadinAurora,1603936745,"**November is the Month for praying for the souls in Purgatory.**

Each person can help the souls in Purgatory through good works assigned by the Church who has the authority from Christ to apply them to the merits of His Passion and death, and the merits of the saints.

**On November 2nd you can obtain a Plenary Indulgence for yourself or for others**

Here's how:

1.) Make a good confession within a week before or after November 2nd which is All Souls Day

2.) Be sure to be free from all sin, mortal and venial

3.) Visit a Church and pray for the faithful departed who are in purgatory

4.) Say an Our Father along with the ""Creed"" while visiting the church

5.) Say another Our Father for and a Hail Mary for the Pope's monthly intentions

6.) Receive holy communion on the same day or soon after

**From November 1-8th you can also obtain a Plenary for each day.** You can gain several indulgences on the basis of a single confession, but only one can be gained by a single taking of communion in a state of grace and for praying for the intentions of the Pope.

**If you are unable to meet the requirements for a full plenary indulgence then a partial is earned**, and there is no doubt that by gaining several plenary indulgences is immensely beneficial to Holy Souls.

Here's how to gain several plenary indulgences for yourself and for others you know who have died:

1.) Make a good confession within the week before or after November 2nd

2.) Be sure to be free from all sin, mortal and venial

3.) Visit a cemetery and pray for the dead

4.) While visiting the cemetery pray an Our Father and a Hail Mary for the Pope's monthly intentions

5.) Receive Holy Communion on the same day or soon after while still in a state of grace

Please pray for the souls who need you to pray for them because they may have no one else to pray for them to get them out of purgatory

God Bless and pray for all humanity and all who have passed on. **Those in heaven can pray for and assist us, so the more souls we free from purgatory by our prayers, the more help we have destroying evil and all the works of the devil here on earth.**",OrthodoxChristianity

Turning back to faith I held this false impression that my relation with God would become special or “better” then his relation with others. This is a complete delusion and I almost fell in that hole and was arguably in it for a few months I started studying way more about prelest and the reality of spiritual deception in the world. A second big one which happened just right now. I always thought Mary didn’t die a virgin. No idea how this belief came to be, but it was definitely influenced by the Passion of Christ the movie which shows Jesus’ brothers, the verses about his family,  and the whole nativity depiction with Mary and Jesus.

My problem with committing to Orthodoxy,MarysDowry,1603846462,"I am posting this to get some opinions on my issues here. I've found a lot of enjoyment and spiritual benefit from my experience with the church so far, but I find myself wavering on two very critical issues.

The main one is that I don't think theres enough evidence for me to wholeheartedly confess that the church is **the** one holy catholic apostolic church. I obviously see the church as a holy apostolic church, but I don't see the evidence for me to be truly and honestly proclaim that its a sole inheritor of the title and that its claims are unrivaled. 

The second, and connected problem is that I don't see a solid reason for accepting the infalliability of the church. Ultimately most the arguments come to highly subjective and circular reasoning, that relies on the church being the sole artbiter of scripture. 

The historical record from my searching doesn't actually paint the clear lineage of apostles -&gt; bishops that the apologetics claim. The Catholics have this problem too, that the evidence doesn't seem conclusive on whether they can honestly claim a direct succession from Peter, or even whether Peter was in Rome at all. 

To me, I think honestly proclaiming publicly that a specific group of people are solely imbued with authority over Gods doctrine and the declaration of truths about God himself, requires a lot of evidence. Part of me feels it would be wrong to proclaim such a thing, how can I be certain that I am honestly testifying about God? By arguing that the Orthodox church is the sole church, I would be arguing explicitly that God has certainly and infalliably condoned all its decrees. 

Part of me is hesistant to assent to certainties that I am not certain of, or cannot verify. 

I am probably overthinking these things, but its good to look at the reality of a situation. I expect there are many in the church who do not genuinely believe what the church claims about itself, and its entirely possible that I could participate in the church without being fully convinced. 

In short, my point is that while I love the Orthodox church in many aspects, I don't find myself fully able to assent to all that the church claims of itself. I simply do not see the evidence for it. And I am hesistant to attach myself to a purportedly infalliable authority which I am not sufficiently convinced is legitimate.

St. Porphyrios: 'He rains on the righteous and the unrighteous',superherowithnopower,1603762455,"From the book, *Wounded by Love: the life and wisdom of Elder Porphyrios*, pp. 64-65:

&gt;On the Feast of the Theophany, after the Great Blessing of the Water, it was the custom to go round and bless people's homes by sprinkling the Holy Water. One year I also went and did the blessing. I would knock on the doors of the flats, and when the door was opened I would enter singing: 'When in Jordan you were baptized, O Lord...'. As I was going down Maizon Street I saw an iron gate. I opened it and entered the courtyard, which was full of mandarin, orange and lemon trees, and walked towards the stairway. It was an outside stair that went up to a first floor and also down to a basement. I went up the stair, knocked at the door and a woman appeared. When she opened the door for me I started as usual to sing: 'When in Jordan you were baptized, O Lord...'. She stopped me abruptly. In the meantime, however, my voice had been heard and girls started coming out of the rooms from right and left in the corridor. 'I see what's happened,' I said to myself,' I've stumbled on a house of ill fame.' The woman stood in my way barring my entrance.  
&gt;  
&gt;'Go away,' she said to me. 'It's not right for these girls to kiss the cross. Let me kiss the cross and then, please, go away.'  
&gt;  
&gt;I assumed a serious and reprimanding attitude and said to her:  
&gt;  
&gt;'I'm afraid I cannot leave! I am a priest and I have come to bless the house.'  
&gt;  
&gt;'That's all very well, but there's no way these girls can kiss the cross.'  
&gt;  
&gt;'But how do we know who should kiss the cross, the girls or you? Because if God were to ask me who should be allowed to kiss the cross, I might reply that the girls should kiss it and not you. Their souls are in a better state than your own.'  
&gt;  
&gt;She blushed for a moment. So I said, 'Let the girls come and venerate the cross.'  
&gt;  
&gt;I signalled to the girls to come forward and started to sing 'When in Jordan you were baptized, O Lord...' with even greater gusto than before, because I felt a sense of joy that God had so arranged things for me to come to these souls.  
&gt;  
&gt;They all kissed the cross. They were all immaculately turned out with their coloured skirts and so on. And I said to them, 'Blessings on you all, my children. God loves all of us. He is very good and *sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous*. He is the Father of us all and is concerned for each one of us. Only we too must try to come to know Him and to love Him and to become good. Love Him and you'll see how happy you'll be.'

Analyzing the claim that Fr. Seraphim Rose is unpopular on the sub,retrogamer_wv,1603678631,"The title says it all. This post isn’t meant to say there aren’t people who haven’t brought up legitimate criticism of some of his teachings (there are), nor is this a post saying that there aren’t some people who just straight up dislike him. This is a post to discuss the data behind whether it is true that the sub doesn’t “like” him.

I was inspired to make this post due to the occasional posters who try to excuse their own uncharitable behavior by linking themselves or their comments in some way to what Fr. Seraphim Rose taught/said. It’s become a meme of sorts to claim that users here don’t like him or that these posts get downvoted. I decided to dig into the sub’s history thanks to the search tool and got the stats for upvotes/downvotes and the percentage of upvotes on each post primarily focus on Fr. Seraphim Rose since the sub was established. This whole thing took about 15 minutes and some knowledge of Excel.

First, I’ll give my data (rounded to the nearest tenth), then I’ll give my reasoning for including or not including different posts.

Total posts: 37
Average # of Upvotes: 22.5
Average # of Downvotes: 1.5
Average Percentage of Upvotes: 93.5%


Methodology:

I only included those posts that were explicitly about Fr. Seraphim Rose. For example, if it was a post primarily about THs (the dreaded dead horse topic to rule them all) that only mentioned him in passing or a post about someone making book suggestions in which he was included, I didn’t include it. If it was a post primarily about his view of THs or a post about his books, it was included. I included every post that was explicitly about him from present to approximately 9 years ago.

Conclusion:

Fr. Seraphim Rose is way more popular in this sub than some of his more zealous fans like to think he is. It seems like some people like to think of him as being this outside figure who the average “ecumenist” or “heretic” can’t stand, of which they have freely labeled folks here when their own uncharitable behavior/language is penalized. While there does exist some disagreement over some of his teachings and whether they are over or under utilized (depending on which side you fall), it seems like he’s a well-liked person here.",OrthodoxChristianity

I pray this happens one day. I pray not that we achieve unity by “sweeping our differences under the rug” but by reconciling our disagreements in true respectful dialogue and brotherhood. So many oriental and eastern Christians die as martyrs under the same sword. May we one day unite under the same banner. Please brothers and sisters. Pray for unity.

So I Visited A Coptic Orthodox Church,scriptoriumpythons,1603665200,"So for context up front i want to admit that im an Anglican lurker on this sub not Orthodox. today 3 friends and i went to a Coptic church to experience the Divine Liturgy and i thoroughly enjoyed the experience. i was deeply moved by the deep saturation of scripture, the retention of ancient liturgical tradition, and the chanting. i felt like i was being invited to dinner in a ""lived in"" church tradition rather than the sterile and overly polished productions that alot of my previous church exeriences have been. i loved that i wasn't catered to and that the liturgy was for the community which regularly worships together. even though it was an ""english service"" at least half of it was in greek. 

my friends on the other hand seem to have had the opposite experience. one gentleman in particular who we shall call ""Jim"" (not real name) seemed to hate every moment about the experience. he complained that because everything was fast or chanted that there was ""NO WAY that anyone could meditate on or truly appreciate the scripture like this. its all just rote ritualism!"" he despised the incense, the poor production quality (admittedly the chanting wasn't done by professional singers and did go off key a bit or off tempo here or there) , the repetition (we must have said the creed like 7 or 8 times), or the length of service (roughly 3 hours). my other friends found the children in service to be distracting and the speed of the prayers to be almost incomprehensible (i found both aspects charming and after the first 45 minutes was keeping up relatively well).

my attempt to defend the church over lunch rested mostly on the idea of lex orandi lex credandi and that since orthodox are known for not changing the liturgy the saturation in scripture was a good thing when instituted and still provided a consistent place to have the scriptures ""sink in"" to the person and that the speediness was probably just an Egyptian cultural thing and for them its probably easy to keep up and meditate on whats being spoken. Jim  held his line that NO ONE could possibly benefit from so much scripture being said at once and that scripture is such that a single verse should be meditated upon for hours rather than having so much dumped on a person that they cannot retain any of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

my questions for you guys , as someone who wants to defend orthodoxy to his protestant friends, then become: Have any of you experienced this sort of situation where you drink deeply from the well of God's mystery only to have the person sitting next to you hate all of it? what responses and defences can i use for these critiques of the Coptic church in the future? was i right in thinking the speed reading was a cultural adaptation of the liturgy? do my friends positions hold any merit among others strains of orthodox?

Baptizing a baby without the intent to raise the kid as Orthodox - how is this gonna work?,KnowWhatYouWrite,1603664761,"If the parents of a child are nominal or nonpracticing, would a priest refuse to baptize their infant if he doesn't see them having an intent to raise the child under the faith?

I am writing a story and I am trying to *know what I write!* So I have these parents set in Russia who aren't serious Christians though they're Orthodox in name and tradition, they were raised during the Soviet atheist era and drifted from the faith. When they have their newborn they don't try to take him to church or get baptized, but the grandma (a devout Orthodox) insists on getting her grandson baptized at a specific cathedral, so the parents do so just to please her.

If the parents are ""considered Orthodox"" and there isn't any serious reason to think the parents are living an unChristian life (like living together unmarried or supporting stuff against Orthodox values) what stops a priest from baptizing their kid?

Help on Holy Communion.,dateretic,1603660007,"Hi everyone, I recently left protestantism and became Catholic (There are no orthodox churches in my country  were to get better informed). But I have a very deep concern. My local catholic parish does not give the blood of Christ only the Body of Christ and I was raised on a church were BOTH are give so It struck me hard that this side is neglected in catholicism??

I searched for it on google ""I am receiving half of the comunnion and i dont like it"" in google and found out the inconcistency on this in the catholic church through its history to the point were the ban the blood of Christ to others in the past. Is a fundamental and impprtant part of my faith so I asked on askapriest about this and they only told me that the priest has the right to say no to my request despite my need of it. And after seeing about orthodoxy i ve seen they give both and even childs are part of the sacrament (wich is what i am used since childhood).

I am a woman so I must face more obstacles as well due to this. I have the Idea of taking comunnion in my house, invest good money into honouring vessels and provide this to my family every time we reunite after church if we receive an incomplete comunnion to help this missing part.

But I dont know wich solution can be done beside conforming to this insatisfied religious life.

There are no orthodox churches in my state and i cant find nothing in mexico to at least travel in Christmass as vacation to have the communion in an orthodox church.

I ve learn that byzantine rite who is in communion with RCC as well provides a complete communion but theres nothing too near me.

Phyletism and why we suck at being Catholic,TedpilledMontana,1603595952,"I'm an American, six generations removed from German immigrants, raised in the midwest, given Lutheran education up until jr. high, raised by non-Christian parents. I found Orthodoxy after a lot of reflection and research. I looked at practically every other denomination before I came to Orthodoxy. It just odd to me, something I only ever associated with Russians. This is pretty true too for most Americans, who if they ever think about Orthodoxy at all, think of it as being an immigrant's denomination. 

For being supposedly, *the Catholic Church*, we really suck at being universal. The last few centuries, we seem to have been struck by terrible bouts of Phyletism and in group preferences. In all my years living in America, i've never seen any Orthodox reach out to try and expand the church to the greater public, and even media wise the only representation I've ever seen was that one scene in "" Hail Caesar! "".  Not only do we not reach out, but trying to find the right Orthodox church in America is ridiculous! This country has several different and overlapping autocephalous diocese, which cater mostly to a distinct immigrant population. Save for perhaps the OCA, there is no uniquely American Orthodox Church. 

What is more, our old world churches are an absolute mess, and rife with conflict! The Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, and all the other Balkan churches are being wrapped in the greater political conflicts of their nations and pitting allies against each other, causing total discord between the diocese ( Over secular politics no less )!

What I am getting at is, I have found Phyletism to be a serious problem in our church, and it has seriously come to hinder our ability to fulfill our mission - to teach and educate on the gospel. We're viewed as the weird immigrant chapel, that can't let go of old world rivalries. Is there any hope of crushing nationalism in the church?",OrthodoxChristianity

As I begin preparing to become a catechumen towards Lent, and then enter into the Church as Pascha, I think I want my name to be Grimwald, after the little-known 9th-Century Saint of the same name, who was an abbot and scholar in the court of King Alfred the Great of Wessex. I hope to emulate his dedication to knowledge and piety in my own life. Due to the fact that he is a Western saint, with only very few people knowing of him, there are no icons of him, and I hope to paint one.

I have since resigned from my position as a council chairman at a prominent atheist organization after 30 years. May God bless me, a reborn Christian, and everyone.",FormerAtheistGrandpa,1603529842,"Hello neighbors, I am so thrilled to be writing this. My former atheist self would be appalled by his future self ever writing such a post, but here I am, at 63 years old, a reborn Christian after 4 decades of atheism. In 1957, I was born into a middle class Protestant family in the suburbs of Indiana, the USA. I used to be a good Christian for my time, participating in all church ordeals, committing to mass, Sunday prayer, and at one point, being an assistant teacher for the Christian theology class in my private Christian high school. I was a devout Christian, dedicating my whole life to serving God. In no way would’ve I thought, that I would end up converting to atheism. It happened, at age 19, I decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue law school. Fun days, traveling across the US in my beat up Chevy. Upon arriving, I started attending university (I am not going to name it due to privacy reasons), it was more secular than my previous life in Indiana. More religious diversity, and of course, atheism. 

I attended at the university for 4 years. Not much to report on regarding my Christian faith other than the fact it started to become less important. I went from praying at minimum 6 times a day in my freshman year to at most, 2 times a week my senior year. I graduated, and started working at my first law firm in Los Angeles. I met a woman there at work, a strong atheist, but very nice and charismatic woman. I soon started pursuing her with my young and zippy 23-24 year old body and got her on a date. So fast forward a few dates and we become intimate and serious. Religion, as in any relationship, is brought up and I express my Christian faith. I realize at that moment in particular that it’s been ignored for quite some time since my move from Indiana to California. She starts asking me some questions, first playful, but after some drinking, some serious questions that couldn’t leave my mind. My life took a turn, I started asking for answers, is God real at this point, etc. I read the Bible to no avail anymore. Fast forward 4 months of this, I decide to become an atheist. My girlfriend, pleased and intrigued begins feeding into it. I started realizing that indeed many past events were attributed to religion. That was one aspect of my anti-theism. 

But what really sparked my anti- theism was when I flew back to Indiana for thanksgiving with family. They start prayer before eating. I take a big breathe in, in annoyance. My father gets offended by this and tells me something to the extent that God doesn’t wish to be disrespected as such during dinner. Then I get up and say something to the extent of “Guess what, I’m no longer apart of the church. That’s right, I am tired of being fed all these Christian lies, I’m an atheist. I just said it”. Not even a second later, my mother gets up and throws her spoon at me and yells at me to get the f*** out. I run upstairs to get my clothes and pack up, before my father grabs me by my wrist and pushes me down to the floor, breaking my ankle. I screamed at them to leave me alone as I ran out of the front door. 

Arriving back in Los Angeles, I’m convinced that religion is evil. I was mad and angry. I never spoke with my family for another 25 years after that. Fast forward several years, I see a stand on the side of the road on my way to work, a pro-atheist organization in search for members to join. I won’t say names for protection purposes. But 30 years ago, I joined it and rose up the ranks. Those decades that followed weren’t too important so I didn’t include them. But I raised a family and lived a comfortable life. 

Following my retirement this year right after the coronavirus outbreak, I had more free-time available. So I started participating more in my online atheist organization meetings and events. I started noticing the negativity, and the flaws of atheism. Why did I notice them at 63 years old, I started becoming more observant and spent hours more of my time in the organization, so I naturally became more observant. 

Following my epiphany, I started studying Christianity. I started realizing it had significant groundings for being the truth. I prayed to God after so many years of neglect praying for answers. 1 month later, my grandson, a teenager, comes home from school. He leaves some cookies on the counter, and I decide to eat them. No later than 2 hours, I am completely out of this world, I was laying on the floor and started hallucinating, I started seeing shapes and weird things. I noticed food tasted better and music sounded better. I realized in that moment God did this. God was showing me a small sliver of heaven. I asked my grandson where he got those holy cookies from, he was quite nervous but didn’t answer. This is what caused me to realize only something divine could cause such an experience.

So following that, I resigned the atheist organization. I am reading the Bible, and have now accepted Christ. God put those cookies there for me to eat, nothing in this world, (especially something a teenager would ever have, there is simply no chemical in the world that could do what those cookies did) could have caused such a divine experience. 

I am now a Christian.

I posted this on the Christianity part of Reddit and the commenters were very mean to me. So I hope that does not extenuate here, thank you and God bless.

Question on conversion,SlavaIsusuChristu333,1603472596,"I'd like to first point out that I recognize these questions will be best answered by my parish priest and I do plan on having this conversation with him on Sunday, after Divine Liturgy.

After a long struggle these last two years of feeling torn between Orthodoxy and Catholicism, I feel like I have finally been led to a point where I feel comfortable about converting.  Some of you whom I've spoken with on here already know my family situation and why I am still taking things as slowly as I can.  But I do feel that I am ready to begin the catechumen process (at Father's discretion).  I am not 100% convinced on the claims of Orthodoxy as regards Catholicism.  I have stopped looking at apologetics materials from both sides as I feel much of my struggle has been self induced.  Every time I read the position of Orthodoxy I find myself convinced.  Then I seek out Catholicism's response and find myself convinced by the apologetics in that regard.  And this is going both ways.  Every time I feel one side has a ""gotcha"" moment of proving their claim over the other, some saint or apologist in the course of history has seemingly answered it to a convincing degree.  The only thing that got me over this intellectual hurdle was convincing myself that, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter to my state in life.  I am a laymen.  Figuring out all the nuances and differing opinions on church teachings is for the clergy to resolve.  This has been a difficult place to reach but I am feeling really good about it at the moment, so I'm going with it lol.

The reason I mention that is that I am not sure what to expect when the time comes for converting.  I have read that some parishes (maybe all) have a point in the being chrismated and received into the church, where I would have to renounce/denounce Catholicism.  I don't know if I'll ever be able to give intellectual assent to that.  Regardless of what certain Catholics and Orthodox believe about only their side being the true church, I am convinced that Catholicism and Orthodoxy remain one and the same Church.  Yes, communion is broken.  Yes, there are theological variances that have led to wide chasms growing between the twos way of thinking and approaching God and His Sacred Mysteries.  But at the end of the day, the same Jesus Christ makes Himself present on the altar in both Churches.  If nothing else, this shows God is willing to work His salvation in both communions.  So for me, I don't think I will ever be able to fully denounce Rome.  I don't have any desire to.  I don't wish to be in communion with Rome anymore (especially Rome as it is today) and I am starting to see the fallacy surrounding Vatican I and the sheer overreach that the notion of supreme/universal jurisdiction brings to the Church.  Yet I can't bring myself to denounce it.  

Would this somehow invalidate my sacraments?  If I am to be baptized (and I am going to request a conditional baptism, just in case), is it wrong that in my mind I don't acknowledge it, necessarily, as a valid Baptism?  I firmly and fully believe my Baptism as a Roman Catholic was valid.  I also confess ""One"" Baptism, as per the creed.  Now I don't know enough about sacraments to know with 100% certainty that it is valid, but I've never had any reason to doubt it until now.  And most Orthodox Bishops tend to acknowledge the validity of Catholic sacraments.  But our particular Bishop has been known to baptize all who come into his jurisdiction.  And, in obedience, I would submit to that without fuss.  But would it invalidate the sacrament if, in the back of my mind, I was thinking to myself ""At best, I am just getting wet""?  

Again, these are issues that will ultimately be up to my priest to help me navigate.  But for any other converts who may have had similar thoughts coming into the Church, what helped you navigate this thinking?

I apologize for the lengthy post and thank anyone who is willing to weigh in.  God Bless!",OrthodoxChristianity
How to lovingly interact about Orthodoxy with my Grandparents disillusioned by Hypocrisy?,Ortho-Apologia,1603472310,"I wasn’t exactly sure how to word the title, but basically my grandparents are both Orthodox Christians who are fine with most Orthodox practices that are a stumbling block for protestants (ie prayer to saints, veberation of saints and the Mother of God). Regardless, they are totally disillusioned by hypocrisy that neither think liturgy, confession, communion or fasting are necessary, and calls these ‘man rules’ because of unkind Greek people who receive and are ostensibly pious. I am not sure how to respond to this because these are basic non-negotiable Orthodox practices. Heck, from the top of my head at least three sacraments are explicitly mentioned in the Gospel of John! But my grandparents think I’m extreme for fasting, thinking church is necessary and wanting to consult my priest for things.

My mom is fine with these things, but is more of an ecumenist/protestant who is baptized Orthodox, and thinks all are ‘valid’ forms of Christianity.

My parents, especially my Dad, an inquirer, is the only one of my family who I can really talk about these things with and not be told “those are man rules. You are extreme and should stop.” I’m kind of worried they are, but at the same time I am sad that my grandparents have separated themselves from the church.

God has turned his back to us,TaftMacNcheese,1603392900,"2020 has been a very difficult year for many of us. This year my wife and I lost our first child in her womb, we were devastated by it. It didn't help that it seemed like the whole world around us was literally falling apart. It felt like God and turned his back to us.

In the midst of all this, I was studying the teachings of Saint Gregory Palamas. I was trying to understand the distinction between God's essence and his energy. Obviously the opponents of Palamas saw this as him teaching there is a ""division"" in God.

One argument I read in a commentary on this subject said that God often does make distinctions with in himself. They pointed to Exodus chapter 33 where Moses is speaking with God and he asks to see God's face. God declines to do this in order to protect Moses because no man had seen his face and lived.

What I found very particular about this story is God doesn't just leave it at that; he instead allows Moses to see his 'back' and cause all of his goodness to pass in front of Moses. Showing a distinction between his 'face' and his 'back'. 

God turned his back to Moses not abandon him, but to allow Moses to participate in his goodness in a very real way. 

Even when this world seems absent of good, God's energy is here for me, my wife, and my Church. I'm eternally thankful for that. I'm thankful for Saint Palamas for teaching me that.

What is the difference between Mary's pre-purification and the Catholic idea of Immaculate Conception?,hobojoe9127,1603349929,"The former term (pre-purification) can be found in the Fathers, and I presume it is referred to in the Liturgy when we say that Mary is ""all holy"" and ""sinless"". 

For example Nazianzen states,

&gt;And in all things \[Christ\] becomes human, except sin. He was conceived by the Virgin, who was prepuriﬁed (prokathartheises) in both soul and  ﬂesh by the Holy Spirit, for it was necessary that procreation be honored and that virginity be honored more. (Patrologia Graeca, 36:633C) 

For reference, here's the official RCC declaration of the Immaculate Conception:

&gt;We declare, pronounce and define that the doctrine which holds that the Blessed Virgin Mary, at the first instant of her conception, by a singular privilege and grace of the Omnipotent God, in virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Savior of mankind, was preserved immaculate from all stain of original sin, has been revealed by God, and therefore should firmly and constantly be believed by all the faithful.

In the current environment, it is impossible to proceed. We must err on the side of caution.

I am suspending services until we have test results back, hopefully early next week. If negative, we can resume our normal schedule. If positive, we will be closed for a short period, while the situation is resolved through further testing.

"Pre-Communion Fasting in Serbia, Romania, etc fasting more than the usual fasts and midnight before communion",Classic_Result,1603333715,"I've heard that in Serbian and Romanian (and others?) churches, you have to fast something like a week before you intend to receive communion. Basically Lent for a week before you receive communion. Then in a comment on here, someone said that was a response to infrequent communion.

I almost freaked out when a Serbian friend said you fasted ""on water"" but then he clarified that meant ""food cooked without oil."" Still tough, but there's no way I'm only drinking water for a week just to receive communion.

I once visited a Serbian parish in America and the guy I actually talked to (from Bulgaria, I think) made a point of referencing that, because the previous week was a no fasting week (before Lent), I should be fine to receive communion if I make sure to get to confession.

My question then is, what's the story here? If you practice more regular communion in Serbia (or wherever they do more stringent fasting rules before communion), do you pretty much have to become a vegetarian? Or does the priest know who you are and that you're regularly keeping the fasts, or what?

Where did this rule come from? It strikes me as being unreasonably tougher than even the already tough Orthodox fasting rules. What is the purpose of this rule?",OrthodoxChristianity

Venting on the “should you cross your legs at Church” discussion,Malphayden,1603316759,"I admit I’m just venting here about something admitted probably very low on the importance scale in the grand scheme of things. I’m open to corrections and counter points.

 I’ve seen the conversation come up numerous times and in numerous places about whether it’s appropriate to cross one’s legs in church. Saw it again recently and it keeps niggling at the back of my mind. Most often, the well intentioned response seems to be something along the lines of “if you were in the presence of a king would you cross your legs?!” 

I’ve chaffed at that answer but couldn’t really put my finger on why until today. Full disclosure, I generally agree that it’s probably best avoided whilst at church. However, it’s the above rationale I struggle with. I wouldn’t go to the bathroom, take a shower or lie on my bed in the presence of a king, and yet I think most would agree those are all perfectly acceptable times to pray and seek God. 

I think I’d say rather, that there a time and place for everything. Crossing your legs, slouching etc. are generally positions of rest, relaxation and sometimes even disengagement. When we’re at Church, it’s a time to be at attention and fully engaged. We don’t draw the same sharp separation between our bodies and our spirits that much of Western Christianity does. Physical posture and action can very much influence our internal dispositions. And so, to assist us in being full attentive and engaged, we should keep a posture that best aids that end.

Thoughts on the patristic teachings on the age of the Earth and a literal Genesis?,solidart20,1603283606,"According to the sources used in [this](https://youtu.be/x5z-Q6Gj-Zk) video (a comment on which predicts that posting the video on this subreddit will not be well-received), as well as arguments made by J*y D**r such as in [this](https://youtu.be/GkAQS8hP_R8) video, the Church Fathers are unanimous agreement that Genesis is literal. This implies that the truly Orthodox belief is that Genesis is to be taken literally and historically (as well as having symbolic and metaphorical meaning). It is apparently therefore unacceptable to call yourself a truly Orthodox Christian and deny the revalation of scripture teaching that the Fall of Mankind is literal history, the Creation of Adam and Eve as literal history, the Creation of the Earth as literal history, as well as the outright denial of Theistic Evolution as a possibility, and thus a complete rejection of Darwinism.

Fr Seraphim Rose's book ""Genesis, Creation, and Early Man: The Orthodox Christian Vision"" fully expounds upon this view. 

Those that defend this position say that if you accept the genuine authority of the Church Fathers, you cannot pick and choose which of their theological teachings to accept based on modern scientific and ideological developments.

I was baptised into the Orthodox Church and raised as an atheist, but I am recently discovering the faith. However, these views, which seem to be absolutely and unanimously defended by true Orthodoxy, are currently preventing me from calling myself an ""Orthodox Christian"". 

I predict that many of you will say that these beliefs are not a necessary part of the Orthodox belief system, but I am quite sure that those of you who say this will do so out of not having heard these arguments before, and have therefore not taken them into legitimate consideration before self-identifying as an Orthodox Christian, and instead deny these Orthodox teachings because they conflict with your own beliefs while still desiring to be Orthodox.",OrthodoxChristianity

I had chronic diarrhea for about 4 years due to an untreated infection ( from when I was around 15 years old ) , I ONLY grew ONE CM in those 4 years; from 15 to 18 years old . I was barely eating and skipped most meals ,I had a complete loss of appetite and I didn’t feel hungry at all . I usually had one meal per day.

I didn’t seek medication until the condition became unbearable ( very painful with lots of diarrhea per day) in the fourth year of my disease .

I did a stool analysis and there was Entameba Histolytica with Undigested food .so I ate very little, had malabsorption and diarrhea.

I went to an endocrine doctor and he measured my wing span and said that my vertical height is 10 cm shorter than it should be for the right proportions. I did an X-ray on my knees and all my growth plates have fused which means that I won't grow taller anymore. I wasn't into sports or literally any physical activity ,was very very inactive through my teenage years, stayed in home playing video games all day.

So I was sitting on my chair all the time not doing any physical activity although I knew I was the shortest among my friends , I didn't care back then and now, I regret not doing stretching exercises or trying to eat more . I truly think I stunted my growth with my horrible lifestyle , I am way shorter than my dad.

Can you please pray that God helps me get my lost height ? Can God even grant such a prayer after all my growth plates have fused? I only want an inch or two.

Of Charismatics and Tolerance,DadHocHypothesis,1603115635,"As a sympathetic outsider, I've seen Orthodoxy (at least in the ideal Internet version) as being good at tolerance, at seeing and affirming the best in other traditions, and even other religions, without compromising on their errors. I've come to see that one particular, very popular tradition here in America is exceptionally hard for me to do this with, and that's (*ominous chords*) the Charismatic tradition. 

I find it very difficult to look past the practices and beliefs that form the cornerstone of that tradition, given how much they conduce to prelest, charlatanism, and sometimes heresy. I also find it off-putting when Charismatics attempt to root their beliefs in anything before the turn of the 20th Century, because they always do it in a dishonest way (though probably not intentionally). ""Francis of Assisi performed miracles; therefore tongues"" fashion, and usually with no small dose of smugness.

And yet, they show an openness to elements of ancient Christianity that other Protestants (or maybe just me) find suspect. Angels and demons, relics (at least if the ""oils from the holy land"" and ""rags blessed by TBN celebrities"" market is any indication ^(also, what do you actually use relic oils for?)), miracles... it's just so often divorced from holiness.

I've heard it claimed that at ecumenical gatherings, Catholics and Calvinists will naturally talk shop on doctrine, while Orthodox and Charismatics will do the same regarding worship. Is that true?

Lust / Adultert,orthodox716,1603078147,"So about 2 and half years ago, I gave my life to Christ, He set me free from drug addiction and so much sins such as hate and anger and yeah.... except 1 thing. The sin of lust/adultery. This has been such a fight where I’ve fallen in despair countless times, thinking God won’t forgive me, this has been a struggle where I’m giving all my money away to the needy because if I don’t and have money on me I end up spending on a prostitute. I sometimes choose not to talk to girls at my own church because I have bad feelings. I sometimes end up going in a train and going to a side where I can’t see a girl and if a girl does end up sitting close to me, I move somewhere else. I say the Jesus prayer a lot but ofc sometimes I don’t end up reciting the Jesus prayer. I’ve been so behind in my study because I end up feeling like I need to spend time in prayer and reading in case I fall.

All I have to say is this is such a struggle, ive talked to a lot of different preists, ive been guided by my spiritual guide, and so on and still... I’ve fallen and fallen and fallen.

I’ve felt the grace and love of God many times fill me and this literally takes away and feeling and thought of lust that if I end up even looking at a beutifull woman all I see is the image of God and a human.... this is the times God hears my cry because of my struggle.... but that’s sometimes if I feel God closely and am filled with His Spirit which gives me intense love for all, not all the time. Most of the time I struggle.

I ask for your prayers, I’m asking for you guys to ask the intercessions on my behalf if you can but your prayers will help.

And also, if anyone else is struggling, and I know mine is really bad, like I both struggle with porn and spending my money on harlots.... please guys, pray for me, I’m so weak, but my weakness is no excuse for my sin, God can free me, and I’ll keep struggling, but please pray for me guys.

The Shepherd Paradigm - Give me your thoughts,Areyouexperienced34,1603072298," Shepherdism - the pillars that make up shepherd life and what is involved with shepherd life.

Quotes taken from *The Bedouins and The Desert may not be exact.*

**The Desert**

The biblical authors did not need to prove the reality of ""shepardism"" as though it were a construct, they simply had to point to it since it was (and still is to some extent) out there to behold. For the biblical authors, this was the Syrian Desert.

Basically two types of deserts:

The Exilic Desert

One is the sand deserts full of dunes where vegetation only rarely grows. “if any plant life at all is to be found there it consists of the thorn tree which lives on the plains and slope's of this kind of desert. There are in fact vast sand deserts in Arabia Africa and elsewhere in which there are only rare traces of life. No one comes to these unknown lands except for certain Bedouins forced by circumstances to live there and a few daring explores.”

The Edenic Desert

“Although it does contain brought expanses of sand here and there the Syrian desert is not a sand desert, indeed in many parts of it there's good soil where many more types of herbage will grow than in the other sand deserts making it a great place for the Bedouin shepherd seeking a place to stop and raises animals. These deserts are not arid waste lands but they are not devoid of sands and dunes either.. Rather they contain plants and trees and along their fringes there are oases containing an astounding array of vegetation and wildlife, these deserts are inhabited by people and animals. On this land one can still find good soil in which trees take root and grow tall enough to provide shelter for animals seeking protection from the sun. plants grow in such shaded areas and in certain Seasons there's good grass that can support the camel and many other animals especially such wild animals as the wild cow ostrich and gazelle. Indeed there are plants that will take root even in the sandy lands of the desert and some of these grow as high as 8ft tall.”

“One of the unusual characteristics of the desert is that rainfall is rare and occurs only on a few days during the winter season. nevertheless, this small amount of rainfall is sufficient to water spouting plants and trees or to allow the seed scattered in its soil to germinate and grow presenting one with the radiant Splendor of greenery spreading across the surface of the ground. indeed it is not uncommon for such rainfall to send torrential streams pouring down the watercourses leaving pools of water behind them in the bins and depressions and pools where the Bedouins seek water for themselves and their flock. other animals come in and Camp around these pools as well.”

The desert climate is Harsh during the day hot and dry

“A mist watered the face of the ground”

The relative humidity sometimes drops as low as about 7% then that level rises during the night and the water vapor condenses in drops of dew that after Dawn one can see soaking the ground and revitalizing the herbage.  There is so much of this must dew that plants can almost gained sufficient water from the dew collected on their leaves” 

Shepherdism or the shepherd paradigm did not and does not need to be created, made up, built, constructed, or turned into a metaphor by the human mind but rather “it is what it is,” that is, an actual and natural way of life where humans animals and vegetation coexist in a necessary and a mutually beneficial relationship. The Scriptural authors had seen it and they depicted it in the language of their time as having been “set” or “made” by God.

29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. 31And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.

This obviously points to the oases deserts of the Syrian wilderness

1. Date palms
2. In fact, these oases even had trees, date palm trees which produced a sweet edible fruit, The date palm has been prized from remotest antiquity. The fruit has been the staple food and chief source of wealth in the irrigable deserts.

The date palm tree is regarded today as the symbol of nomadism. *It is not unlikely that the palm tree was transplanted into the desert and its various oases from Babylonia* where it was the most significant factor encouraging Ancient Man to settle there 

**Gods Bias for shepherd/desert life**

In the beginning,  we see God set the setting of the shepherd. (Adam). And as early as the story of Cain and Abel the reader of scripture encounters God's obvious bias in favor of Abel, The Shepherd of the flock, over Cain a tiller of the ground and Builder of cities, Noah favored by God as shepherd, things go amiss when he becomes sedentary and plants a vineyard.

The genealogy of Shem, the chosen among Noah's Three Sons, is replete with Shepherd's residing in open stretches of wilderness. The patriarchs, many prophets, the apostles, Christ himself, and God the Father Psalm 23: The LORD *is my shepherd,* I shall not want. are all depicted as shepherds and this depiction is consistently forced upon the reader throughout Scripture, from Genesis to Revelation.

1. **The Bedouin shepherd**

The **Bedouin** are a grouping of nomadic people who have historically inhabited the desert regions in North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq) and the Levant. Bedouins engaged primarily in nomadic herding and  agriculture however, scarcity of water and of permanent pastoral land required them to move constantly. The Bedouin were nomadic shepherds. The English word *Bedouin* comes from the Arabic *badawī*, which means ""desert dweller"", and is traditionally contrasted with *ḥāḍir*, the term for sedentary people.

The duties of a shepherd in an unenclosed area such as the Syrian wilderness involved an amount of effort and difficulty that was oppressively burdensome. 

""In early morning he led forth the flock from the fold, *marching at its head,* to the spot where they were to be pastured. Here he watched them all day, taking care that none of the sheep strayed, and if any for a time eluded his watch and wandered away from the rest, seeking diligently until he found and brought it back. In those lands sheep require to be supplied regularly with water, and the shepherd for this purpose has to guide them either to some running stream or to wells dug in the wilderness and furnished with troughs. At night he brought the flock home to the fold, counting them as they passed under the rod at the door to assure himself that none were missing. Nor did his labours always end with sunset. Often he had to guard the fold through the dark hours from the attack of wild beasts, or the wily attempts of the prowling thief. 

But as I said earlier Shepherdism is not a metaphor it is a concrete reality used throughout the Bible. For example, The Eastern shepherd never drives his sheep as does the Western shepherd. The Eastern shepherd goes before his flock leading with his voice.

*Jon 10:4 “And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.*

The shepherd and flock are intertwined within the “Bedouin paradigm” in that, in an area such as the Syrian Desert wilderness, there is no such thing as a single solitary sheep, at least not for long. A sheep which strays from the flock will not exist for long in the harsh reality of the Syrian desert. Shepherd (as priest) needs the wool of the flock to make a tent (necessary for worship and can also move with the shepherd and flock)...milk, sacrifice, ect.

*If God is a shepherd. which I think psalm 23 establishes, there is only one issue Where is He? Where is God?*

*Well if scripture says God is a shepherd, and we know scripture is talking about a specific type of shepherd 'Bedouin"" then we should be able to stay within the ""shepherd paradigm"" to find our answer.*

3. God’s As the absent Shepherd

In fact,  The shepherd is so constantly with his sheep that sometimes his life with them becomes monotonous. Therefore he will occasionally play with or perhaps ""test"" them. He does this by pretending to run away from his sheep and hiding. and the sheep get all frightened, and have to chase after him and then the shepherd pops back up and the sheep are all surprised. 

When the serpent tempts Eve, where is God?

When Cain slays Abel, where is God?

Like the Eastern Shepherd, throughout Scripture in order to test the resolve of his people to follow his Commandments, God repeatedly plays the role of the absent shepherd. But Since God is the Divine Judge, an absence on his part carries with it a sense of relief among those who would otherwise be standing before the judgement seat.  The role of God as the master who is away is not to be construed in negative terms as though he does not care for us to the contrary God recedes on purpose to the background as an expression of his mercy, this allows us extra time to repent for unsatisfactory Behavior so that whenever he does come back and becomes present we would hope be innocent by grace.

God absents himself for a while in order to test our resolve to abide by his will while he is absent; this is precisely his Touch of Grace since his presence May well reveal itself a harsh new reality.",OrthodoxChristianity

The Oh Hellos and Orthodox imagery,undulating_orange,1603042210,"I would love to hear if anyone here listens to The Oh Hellos!

I think it’s interesting because one of the lead singers was wearing an Orthodox icon hand gesture shirt during a performance. In any case, I think it’s so cool that a secular band is introducing these incredible Biblical allusions, themes of resurrection and healing, and making a difference THROUGH such healing and resurrection. As someone who’s had a problem with contemporary Christian music, their music has been positively nourishing for my faith. 

 This may be me just reading into things  because I’m reading a lot of Orthodox theology right now, but if anyone is interested I would check out the lyrics of the songs in both albums I mentioned. Would love to see their music be more widely accepted/appreciated",OrthodoxChristianity
Would a convent accept a single mother? What do I do?,batschka-,1603041947,"More than likely pregnant, will know for sure in a few days, but everything is adding up so far... Divorced due to feeling unsafe in my marriage. Father of the possible child doesn't care all that much. No family or friends to fall back on (seriously, *none*). Mentally disabled and uneducated. Wanted to be a nun since I was in high school, the reason I committed this sin is because of emotional validation and pressure, but I have always found romance uncomfortable, I was even uncomfortable entering my first marriage... So this isn't because I want a convent to clean up my mess for me, it's because I think that the vocation might work better for me, the lifestyle seems a lot more fitting for my mental condition. I want a simple life. Obviously it isn't working for me in the world.

**I will talk to my priest. I just need ideas. What is there for me to do? What decisions can I make that are okay with the Church? Has anyone heard of a convent taking a woman with a child?**

I made a new account to hide this because even I can't believe this happened to me, and probably most people won't believe me either.

I almost never have dreams unless my brain is trying to wake me up to use the bathroom.

But last night, I had nightmares with dead deer hidden, feelings of being chased, and weirdly organized things into groups of 6.

I woke up and the first thing my inner voice - that ""It's my normal voice when I think about things"" voice - was ""You weren't supposed to see that"".

As soon as I realized what just occured, I spoke the Jesus prayer and made a sign of the cross. I was able to fall asleep afterwards, thankfully, with no more nightmares.

I, on a different account, have been on this subreddit and have read similar stories of weird stuff like this hapoening. I thought the people were just naive bozos and moved on (not very Christ-like).

Thoughts on Universalism and David Bentley Hart,WonderingAboutTruth2,1602896126,"Hey there. So, I’m currently studying about Orthodoxy, and I was very surprised to learn about Hart’s defense of Universalism. In Western Christianity (mainstream, at least, RCC, Historical Protestants, etc.) when this notion isn’t considered heretical, it is at least seen as too naively merciful. When I first heard of it I figured Hart wouldn’t be considered an Orthodox in that sense either, but, as far as I’ve seen and from what I have heard from an Orthodox friend, this view isn’t condemned in any definitive way. Hart makes the case for it in light of Church tradition (his argument seems to be mainly philosophical given the premises we accept about God) citing saints such as St. Gregory of Nyssa and St. Isaac of Nineveh, who were universalists, and St. Basil the Great saying that he once mentioned that the majority of Greek Christians were also universalists. So, I was wondering if this view can actually be defended in light of Orthodoxy, how popular it is, and what are your thoughts on it.

Is Theosis similar to Wesleyan Entire Sanctification/Christian perfection?,Laurent_Chaput,1602889559,"I'm reading about Theosis/Deification in Eastern Christianity and while I don't fully understand it yet, it sounds somewhat similar to what Methodists and other Wesleyans call ""Entire Sanctification"" or ""Christian perfection"". 

In Wesleyan Christian perfection, a Christian is able to eventually/potentially reach a point of sanctification where they no longer commit voluntary sins (they still commit involuntary sins and still need confession) and have no love in their heart that is contrary to God's will and they have a very pure love of God in their heart. 
Essentially, they believe it's possible through regular Christian practice and the Grace of God, to reach a point where you love God, no longer long for worldy desires and live the kind of life God wants for you and become ""perfect"" in your actions and desires.

Potentially hot button issue regarding Orthodoxy,SlavaIsusuChristu333,1602866950,"Artificial Contraception and/or any sexual activity that is completed not being open to the possibility of life.

Until the 1930s the Eastern Orthodox, along with Catholics and Protestants firmly spoke out against the evil of artificial contraception (if used for the purpose of contraception) and taught that it was immoral and sinful.  After the 30s, one by one, all of protestantism fell into accepting this evil and eventually the Eastern Orthodox Church has as well.  Or has it?  I know Metropolitan Kallistos Ware writes that the contemporary Orthodox theologians teach that it is up to a couple and their pastor to decide if artificial contraception or sexual acts not open to life are ""right for them"", so to speak.  But other Orthodox writers speak out that the Orthodox Church still maintains that artificial contraception and any sexual activity not open to life, are gravely immoral/sinful. Today, only the Catholic Church still fully teaches the truth about the evil of artificial contraception (even if the majority of ""catholics"" openly practice it in defiance of church teaching).

Having said all that, what ""is"" the official teaching of the Orthodox Church on these issues?  If there isn't one, why not?  It should be very obvious that artificial contraception is sinful.  Masturbation is sinful.  Why?  Because it's seeking sexual gratification without being open to the possibility of life, frustrating the purpose of the sexual act.  Even within the context of a sacramental marriage, sexual activity that does not end open to the possibility of life is gravely immoral as it objectifies the other spouse and reduces them to a means of an end.  You are, essentially, using your spouses body for your own sexual pleasure.  This is worse than masturbation as you aren't using your own body for sin, you are using someone else's body, even worse when you consider that it is your spouse you are using (the person you ought to be helping lead to Heaven).

Thank you to any who engage in advance, for your help in clarifying this issue for me.  As I told another poster, this was a major obstacle for me in converting to Orthodoxy.  The position that this is ok stopped me dead in my tracks.  Well, that and divorce and remarriage up to three times (but I've since overcome my difficulty with that position, even if it still makes me decidedly uncomfortable).",OrthodoxChristianity

Questions from somebody that is on a journey towards Christ...,theAlbanianAtheist,1602732876,"My story is quite long, but to summarise it, I used to be a Salafi Muslim and after some time of contemplation and research, I came to a point in my life to where I started to doubt Islam. For a few years I identified myself as an atheist (at times I was more staunch as an atheist compared to other times), and I have slowly shifted away from atheism since then. I would still somewhat call myself a skeptic, or to just phrase that better, somebody that is trying to seek truth, whatever that may be. 

Recently I felt as if I have been given a calling by God to give my life to Christ, and specifically, to join the Orthodox Church. I have no real idea to why and how these strong feelings came about, but generally from my research, I have concluded that Orthodoxy seems to make the strongest arguments in defence of Christianity (in comparison to other denominations). The turning point for me, was when I came across the OT Messianic prophecies which spoke about Jesus, his ultimate sacrifice as an atonement for mankind’s sins; and how this coming Messiah was to be a divine figure from the seed of David. 

I also realised how the OT made mention of many important practices such as the altar; temple; etc; practices which are not found anywhere in Islam. So I wondered, if the word of Allah, the Qur’an, is eternal (and supposedly preserved in the eternal tablets in Heaven), then why does the Qur’an mention the previous prophets, and some stories from the OT, but choose to ignore/not mention those above important concepts and practices which were central to the Jews? How can Islam therefore be a continuation of the previous revealed texts? 

I feel as if I am not ready however to make the next step of becoming a Orthodox Christian, let alone just a non-denominational Christian. The main reason obviously, is because of my past of being a Muslim. Innately, even though it does make sense to me, I do still feel uneasy and uncomfortable in accepting the Trinity and in worshipping Jesus. Many years ago, I would have said that such acts and beliefs are shirk (associating partners with God, so idolatry). I guess with time these feelings will grow as my faith grows... But before I go forth in accepting the faith, I would want some of my questions answered. Just to make it clear from now, I am ignorant on Christianity, church history and church fathers, etc.

Anyway... The first question: why are there images in Orthodox Churches, and why are they revered and kissed? What benefit can images give to a person? Is this not a form of idolatry and an act of worship? In Islam, we were taught that merely having a cross around ones neck constitutes disbelief; bowing down to anybody other than God constitutes disbelief; and other things. The second question: I have watched a few Divine Liturgies on Youtube, and yes they are very beautiful. But I realised how those attending the mass would kiss the hands of the bishops/patriarchs (I am not sure what they are called). Where is the Biblical teaching for this? Are there any Biblical verses that allow this? Or are there any other apostle writings which allow this? The third question (which ties with the last): are there apostle writings which talk about how these Divine Liturgies, for example, should be done? And is there a concept of consensus concerning this? Or have things somewhat changed? The fourth question: why do the women in the church not fully cover their hair? Does the Bible not command that they should? The fifth question (a more general question for Christianity): how is it clear that the Holy Spirit is a divine person of YHWH, and not only a divine attribute/ability of the Father and the Son? The sixth question: how can one square the fact that the Father seems to be the ultimate person in the Trinity, but that nevertheless, the 3 persons in the Trinity are still equal? The seventh question: why does the NT state that Jesus was given the ability and power to perform miracles? If he is a divine person in the Trinity, by virtue of his divine essence, would he not already have these abilities and powers? Is him being granted these proof that he is lesser of a divine person compared to the Father? The eighth question: are all 3 persons today in the Trinity spirits, without body? The ninth question: why does the NT at times describe the Father as being the one true God? Is YHWH was the 3 persons, would this not be a contradiction? Was this not clear when Jesus said that he is going to his father and our father, our God and his God (as if the Father is the only divine person and being)? The tenth question: what is the position of the Orthodox Church towards the other denominations and churches? Are they all seen to be false, and is Orthodox Christianity seen as the only pure and true form of Christianity? I only say this because I have seen a few Orthodox Christians say these things. They also seemed to have a thing against the Catholics, saying that they are a ‘Church of Satan’, and other things like that... The eleventh question: are there apostle writings or other things like that which make it clear to what acts, beliefs/heresies one holds and falls into which then makes the individual fall into apostasy? It seems as if there should be things like this which do make one fall into apostasy, but are things like this clearly defined and written?

I may have more questions as time goes on, but that is it for now. Other than this though, I do want to ask, as somebody that is not well read into the beliefs of Orthodox Christianity, are there any good resources that I can go on to where I can get these beliefs explained for somebody like myself?

One day I’ll be tempted by Hinduism another by once saved always saved Protestantism next day Catholicism. I will recycle arguments in my head I just know are wrong but I can’t help myself. 

I will say throughout all of this I have never abandoned my faith. Deep down I know Orthodoxy is the truth and whenever these thoughts come I know they will usually pass. That being said it is exhausting to wait them out. I love to research and read so when I doubt that’s where I go. Yesterday for example I had the thought that Palamism was heretical so what did I do. I spent roughly seven hours reading scholarly articles, over simplified apologetics and straight up lies ( the new advent article on hesychasm is particularly bad). None of this reading bolstered or helped my faith. I couldn’t help myself however as to not research and dismiss doubts out of hand seems intellectually dishonest. 

One last thing I have a hunch this may all be demonic as these blasphemous thoughts usually come when I start to take my faith seriously and end when I back down.

Question from a curious protestant,BjoernOvDoom,1602714862,"Greetings my Orthodox brothers and sisters! I hope that you are doing as well as possible in these trying times.
I would like to ask some questions since I don't know much about the Orthodox faith, or about Catholicism either for that matter. You see, I live in Sweden which is a very secular country, and I come from a secular family on top of that so my exposure to theology has been quite scarse, and that is why my questions probably will sound quite ""basic"" so to speak.
I have been a protestant for circa 10 years but I am very curious about  the orthodox faith.

I also hope that my questions does not come off as rude, that is not my intent and I sincerely apologise if so.

My first question:
Is it biblical to talk to the saints during prayer? I presume there is a good reason for doing this since it is a tradition that can be traced back very far, and it is not my intent to accuse your theology of being wrong, this question comes from a place of curiosity, I must admit that I simply do not understand it. What is the reason, why should I do it, and is there any biblical foundation for this practice?

My second question is of a similar kind:
What is the purpose of praying in front of icons? Is this biblically supported? What role does the icon play? And what is an icon to you? My understanding of the matter is that one should not pray in front of any image. Again, I would presume there is a good reason for this as well, but I do not understand this either.

My final question is perhaps more simple and straightforward:
What is the purpose of incense? I find the idea of incense being part of a service to be very pleasant, I like it very much actually but even this, I want to understand.

We’re only destined to spend an everlasting eternity doing nothing but worshipping Him for “sparing” us an eternal death/eternal torment.

What is the actual point of it all if We are just in bondage one way or the other? On one hand, we’re in bondage to suffering and torment due to our disconnection from God. On the other hand, we’re in bondage to doing nothing but worshipping God for eternity.

In both cases, we are in bondage, we have no true freedom to explore, to create etc... the only difference is one is spent in eternal torment, and the other in eternal joy. 

But what is the point of (or difference) between joy or torment when we have no choices to make of our own? Wouldn’t it be more preferable to just cease existing?",OrthodoxChristianity

Divine Immutability,Vasilisonofspiro,1602642590,"I believe in Divine immutability and think it is integral for Christianity to make sense. At the same time I have some questions about the unchanging nature of God. 

Can God feel sadness for us, when we sin does it sadden God. In the Gospels Christ cry’s several times. If God can be saddened how is this problem since his sadness would be dependent on sin and sin is both unnecessary and only appears after the fall. 

If God does not feel sadness when looking at our fallen condition then what does he feel. How can he look at us with anything but pity. If God does not feel pity and sadness for us who can we say he loves us for when I see my loved ones in pain I feel pain. If God is some sort of static existence of pure unchangingness.

Stuck between obedience and following Christ.,Talavaris,1602638556,"My parents are both Protestant and very anti anything not their specific belief system.

My parents are however prohibiting me from continuing in further action, and seem to be writing it off as a phase rather than a dedication. So I’m in a tough situation of whether I’m going to be obedient to their will and stop, and in their minds revert back to Protestantism. Or to move forward and seek a closer relationship with God.

Modernity In The Church or Just A Conspiracy?,austinofthewall,1602629739,"So I am definitely dead set on converting to Orthodoxy, however I have some concerns. The current Parish I’ve been attending is Antiochian and English speaking, but None of the priests have beards and none of the women wear head coverings, the head priest when doing the liturgy seems to rush through it and it sounds like he really doesn’t want to do it. And he told us he doesn’t really want his parish to grow because he likes smaller parishes because it’s like a family which I can understand but that makes me feel like he doesn’t want people to come to the faith. And they aren’t on the old calendar. I’ve seen online in several places that these could be signs of modernity in the archdiocese. There’s a rocor perish 25 minutes further away but I don’t believe they do an English liturgy.

Non-practicing Orthodox marrying a Catholic,Morphiadz,1602625052,"I am not sure how else to word this. I was born into a Russian family but my father was not of the Orthodox faith and my mother did not push the religion on him, therefore I was raised without religion. My sister was baptised in the Orthodox church but my father was very upset by this and did not want me to be baptised and so my mother did not do it. 

I consider myself associated with the religion because I picked up on some traditions and customs from my grandmother who was serious about the religion, but I more or less always considered myself to be agnostic or uncertain of where my beliefs really lie.  


My boyfriend and I plan to get married relatively soon (within a year). He is a very devout Catholic who was born in Mexico and his family is very Catholic as well. He has told me that it does not matter that I am not Catholic, as he believes marriage only needs to be witnessed by God, not by the Catholic Church. He told me we could marry in the Orthodox church or whatever church I want.

I am at a point in my life where I am thinking of seriously studying the Orthodox faith and converting, but as I would just be starting this journey, I am not sure of where it will lead. He wants the children to be raised Catholic, and I know he wants me to get involved with the church in some fashion.

I understand if we were married in the Catholic church that I'd be required to promise to raise the children as Catholics (and not sure what else I'd have to do to get permission from the bishop).

I understand if we were married in the Orthodox Church (once and if I converted) that he would be required to promise to raise the children with the Orthodox faith. 

I understand that both churches would view the marriage as invalid - for example, if we married in the Orthodox church then they would view it as valid but the Catholic no, and vice versa.

Another issue is that I know he would want me to go to church with our family. If I were to convert to Orthodoxy, but raise the children Catholic, would I be able to go to church with them, and somehow still maintain my own faith? We live in Mexico where I haven't been able to find an Orthodox church so I am not even sure it would be possible to marry there or go there with our family. 

And I am still at a point where I have not converted and I am not outright religious. But I appreciate and admire religion and want to do things right.",OrthodoxChristianity

Prophet Muhammad sent some Muslims there to save them from Meccan persecution telling them that the Christian king would protect them. And he did. Your people’s love and hospitality is unwavering.

My Story,HummingAstronaut,1602610069,"Since I have been posting somewhat regularly, I thought I might share some about me. Maybe we can strike up a conversation or something. Since this is the internet (and Reddit none the less) I will be somewhat vague where needed.

I am a middle-aged, husband and father, living in the US.

I grew up in a Christian home, and in a small branch of Protestantism known as the Plymouth Brethren. The PB tradition is basically the polar opposite of Orthodox tradition in many ways, but mostly ecclesiastically. The ""nuts and bolts"" of the faith are shared between the two traditions, but that's about it. For those who are curious, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Brethren) is a link to the Wikipedia article.

Over the years (especially since I became an adult) I have felt uneasy with one thing or another within the churches I attended. I was in and out of the PB traditions, but it seems no matter where I would go, I found something that would irritate me to the point where I would leave for something else. In the last 15+ years, I have been slowly learning about Holy Orthodoxy through a friend who is an Orthodox brother, and various providential moments of guidance. In the last two years, I enrolled in a catholic university for my final few years of finally getting a degree. It was at this point that my interest in Orthodoxy became even clearer. 

I am now at the point where I have begun reading and listening to books about your tradition, as well as various videos. Some of the most interesting to me thus far, have been a series of videos that Hank Hanegraaff has done since his conversion to Orthodoxy, and others featuring Father Stephen Freeman. It's also worth noting that one of my favorite bands is Luxury, of which three members have become Orthodox priests in the last few decades.

Mostly though, this has been a journey of deduction and refining. I now know that what has been bothering me about the churches I have been in is simple - inconsistency. It has been both a relief and a burden to figure that out. It is a relief because I finally know what's been bugging me, but it is a burden because I really don't know what God has for me in the coming years. As you can probably imagine, it's unsettling to realize you need to go back and re-evaluate everything, and continue to let God lead you in the rebuilding. I also know I am not the first person to experience this, nor the last.

So yeah - that's a little bit about where I am. I hope to have some great and honest conversation with you all. Feel free to message me if you like.",OrthodoxChristianity

Conversion and Monastic life : I'm at crossroads,Pau1DT,1602597207,"I've posted here a few times before and y'all have been very helpful. I really need advice with my current situation.

I'm 26 and a cradle Catholic. I expected to enter a traditional Benedictine monastery by fall 2020, but my plans have changed. I've kinda wanted to become Orthodox since I came back to the faith 2 1/2 years ago, it just took that long to have a decent prayer life, discern if this was the will of God and if Orthodoxy was the true Church. Really, although I'd been reading for a while, my first step was to overcome the fear of losing my soul if I questioned the Catholic dogmas, and that happened only 5 months ago, after spending 8 weeks of pandemic lockdown in a Benedictine monastery.

I went to an Orthodox monastery in july, met the abbot and had a great talk. He said that if I really loved God and felt like this was His calling, there was no need to wait a long time because he thought I was old enough and knew enough about the faith to make a choice. This was a great first contact, although I didn't see myself staying in this monastery.

During august I worked on my driver's license. I came home in september to the Orthodox parish where I'd started attending after lockdown, and told the priest about my situation. He advised me to wait and maybe to attend theology courses at his academy. While he is a very holy priest, he talked a lot and I don't know if he really heard me out. I love this parish, but coffee hour has been canceled due to the pandemic and nobody talks to me. Even if I could fit in, I would still leave to become a monk eventually. My studies are completed, I live alone since my sister moved in september, I can get some help from my parents, but I have to support myself and I don't see myself getting a job with no time to visit the monastery. I've just told my Catholic priest and friends that I'm becoming Orthodox and won't attend at our parish anymore, which makes me even more isolated.

HOWEVER, I have been to another monastery (of the Athonite tradition) in september and had a great time there. The monks were very welcoming and they expect me to come back, which I plan to do next week. Maybe I could get chrismated there eventually, I just haven't dared asking yet. In Catholicism, everything is very laid out and not anyone can just stay around in a monastery. I've realized that in Orthodoxy you have to constantly ask questions, and it takes some time to adjust, especially for me.

I don't really have a priest to talk about this, except for the abbot of the first monastery mentioned above. Maybe I should ask for his advice. Sorry if it seems like I want to run away from the world, I know that this is the worst reason to go to a monastery, and this is not my case, I've been preparing for it and I think that the time has come.

TL;DR I have wanted to be a monk for a while, but I'm not Orthodox.",OrthodoxChristianity
Monasticism or the military,EbbyG,1602595933,"Hello!

I’m 20 and would like to become a monk. I recently became a catechumen and was told by the priest that I should probably just focus on being in the church for a few years before becoming a monk. I found orthodoxy at the beginning of this year fyi. 

In these next few years of learning and becoming a member of the church, I was wondering if I could join the military and still stay on track of becoming a monk. 

I’d probably join the navy and get engaged in work that doesn’t lead to killing or harming others. 

I want to join the military for the benefits and the structure it provides. I think that military living would be similar to monasticism since both require obedience to a higher-up. The military seems to get people into quite a few good habits, and those habits I think would also be usable in monasticism. Basically, if done right, the military would prep me for certain aspects of monasticism.

I haven't taken communion or confessed since March. Due to a mix of how COVID restrictions are affecting my local parishes, and personal circumstance, I basically have a dilemma between watching online streams of services - a poor substitute for the Liturgy - or heading over to an Old Calendarist parish that is very close to me to receive communion, but they're obviously schismatic, to say the least.

My family used to attend there before we realized what the situation was, but in hindsight a lot of stuff was strange about them. The serving priest is an abbot who left his monastery in Europe for a mysterious reason; the only line I've found has been vociferously denied by the new abbot of that monastery. He's a really great positive guy, and dedicated, and he serves the Liturgy excellently, and I've never heard anything bad about him from the parishioners, but given his backstory I fear an unknown serious scandal invalidates all that. And I've heard rumors that the church isn't even in communion with any Old Calendarists any longer, but operates as its own corporation... all in all, this is even more of a cluster**** than most schismatic parishes. As I understand it, the parishioners were loath to accept a reorganization requested by the Eparchy, schismed away, and found a clergyman to serve in the church.

Should I bite the bullet and attend here, for the time being, until COVID restrictions go away? I realize how absurd this question may seem, given how heterodox the place is by my own description, but I greatly miss the Liturgy and have encountered spiritual dangers as a result of abstinence.

Advice on Believing More,Ashamed_Shallot_673,1602516566,"Hello friends! I would like advice on coming to God and believing in him. 

I'm from NJ and part of the Russian Orthodox Church. I go to church 1-2 times a week, pray twice a day, listen to 1-hour lectures once a day, try to not sin. 

I feel like I am losing belief in God. I had a period of time where I was certain God existed, but I feel like my religiousness is decreasing. I haven't changed any of my habits: I'm not praying less/going to church less.  I desperately want to believe in God and trust in him, but I am having difficulty. I know that it is sin to want proof that God exists, but I feel like I am losing hope. Every time I hear an Atheist talk or I see corruption within the church I'm easily convinced that God doesn't exist. I went to Israel 4x and even lived in a monastary for some time, so I would expect that I would feel closer to God than I am. I don't understand why it is so difficult for me to believe. Everyone else in my family believes in God.. but I just feel like my belief in God is ""see-sawing"". I have had periods of time where I completely believed in God, but it is just dropping. Right now it is has dropped to an all-time low and I just feel so sad. I'm praying that God brings me back to him, but I don't feel a difference. I'm not planning on giving up but I just feel so sad right now. I desperately want to believe that God exists but I cant. Life just seems so empty and pointless without God, but I just can't force myself to believe in him.

Am I theologically too ‘liberal’ or ‘conservative’?,Ortho-Apologia,1602516206,"I would consider myself fairly theologically moderate, but I am not sure where if I am too liberal or conservative theologically speaking.

On the ecumenism debacle, I would generally agree anti-ecumenists except when they get schismatic over things like the calendar and try to divide Orthodoxy over theolegeumenon. I certainly don’t think it’s ok to attend services of non-Orthodox and unification would have to happen on 100% Orthodox grounds or we are compromising the faith Christ himself gave us. I guess this would be a more ‘conservative’ opinion.

I don’t believe only Orthodox are capable of salvation though, because I have met some super pious protestants that are more holy than I, and since I believe I am being saved, I believe Christ may be saving them as well. So I guess this makes me more liberal?

I believe in evolution, but I accept a literal Adam and Eve and no death before the fall. So that lands me smack dab in the middle?

I am Agnostic on the tollhouses. I think as long as the demons are only accusing you and Christ is the final judge, then I am fine if they are real. If the demons are the ones judging I would be vitriolicly opposed because no one except literal saints could be saved - if them. And that’s clearly heresy. So pretty moderate here I guess. 

My parish is on the new calendar and it’s pretty convenient having Christmas off on the secular calendar, so I guess that factors into making me more liberal.

I am Greek Orthodox and according to super conservative Russian Orthodox we have distorted Orthodoxy do I guess that makes me more liberal too.

But my parents believe I am super conservative. It’s in part due to the fact my godparents would fall into the “ultra conservative” territory. Stay at home mom, five or six kids, overt about fasting and so on. I consider breaking the fasts (unless someone else is serving you, of course) and definitely disregarding them to be sinful, but my parents act like they are just superfluous or there to help you. I am seventeen by the way. I have been pushing them to go to liturgy with me since I cannot go on my own (the church is quite far away and they are a bit over protective), but they believe its enough to just do a bible study from a protestant minister. I have been incorporating Typika into my prayer life as a substitute until I can attend again. I have been debating where I should pray with my parents at dinner because of the fact they are ecumenists (technically speaking, my father is not yet baptized) and I don’t want to compromise the faith. So far I have been doing what I do when I am with protestant friends. While they pray, I don’t make a big show of not praying with them but I simply say Our Father and repeat some Jesus prayers in my head until we are done.

The problem of Acts 15 council of Jerusalem and Pauls testimony,MarysDowry,1602497658,"I am interested in the problem of the disagreement between acts re-telling of the council of Jerusalem and Pauls supposed testimony in Galatians.

Acts 15 says:

""The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter. 7 And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. 8 And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, 9 and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith. 10 Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? 11 But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.” [...]

""Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, 20 but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood. 21 For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.”

Galatians gives us Pauls insight into an event, which appears to be this same council.

Galatians 2:

Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me. 2 I went up in response to a revelation. Then I laid before them (though only in a private meeting with the acknowledged leaders) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, in order to make sure that I was not running, or had not run, in vain. 3 But even Titus, who was with me, was not compelled to be circumcised, though he was a Greek. 4 But because of false believers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us— 5 we did not submit to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you. 6 And from those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders (what they actually were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—those leaders contributed nothing to me. 7 On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised 8 (for he who worked through Peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the Gentiles), 9 and when James and Cephas and John, who were acknowledged pillars, recognized the grace that had been given to me, they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. 10 They asked only one thing, that we remember the poor, which was actually what I was eager to do""

Paul also notes that Peter was enforcing Jewish customs. 

“You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that **you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?**""

The first difference is that Acts 15 gives the impression that this was a public affair, that the church (including believers), elders and apostles were all present. Paul tells us that it was a private meeting (he doesn't call it a council) with only the acknowledged leaders, perhaps referring to Peter and James who he mentions in the paragraph preceding this point. This isn't a big problem though, just an interesting note. 

The issues start when Paul says:

""we did not submit to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you. 6 And from those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders (what they actually were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—those leaders contributed nothing to me.""

Earlier in Galatians 2 Paul recounts the council of Jerusalem, so what is Peter doing enforcing Jewish customs after the council had already settled the issue? Perhaps this enforcing of customs is just referring to Peters drawing back and seperating from the gentiles, I'm not sure. 

Now assuming acts is correct, Paul did infact submit to them. According to acts the council effectively made the noahide laws binding on the gentiles in the church. I see this as a problem because I think a good case can be made that Paul didn't previously (and continued not to) teach these same rulings as necessary.

Take 1 Corinthians 10, written after the council of Jerusalem:

""Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, 26 for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it."" 27 If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. 28 But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience. 29 I am referring to the other person’s conscience, not yours. For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience? 30 If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?""

Now, if Paul truly saw the council of Jerusalem as authoritatively binding, and agreed to the councils decrees, would this not be an opportune time to remind the Corinthians of their obligations to these decrees? Paul seemingly states the opposite, that they should not worry about these things.

Paul does not teach to abstain from strangled meat or blood, he seemingly argues that all food sold in the market is edible without defiling ones conscience. 

Additionally in Romans 14 Paul says:

""Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. **Everything is indeed clean**, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats. 21 It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.""

Paul wrote quite a few times concerning food after the council, but never once does he mention the decrees of it, he never even mentions it taking place other than in Galatians. If Paul was acting as a bishop in the traditional sense, would it not be his foremost duty to teach the proclomations of the unified church? He doesn't do so at all, there is zero mention of these decrees, and he seems to outwardly contradict the rulings.

Seeing as the council of Jerusalem is the prototype of the later councils authority, what does it say if Paul genuinely ignored the decrees? Did he assent to the council as a show, without truly affirming its teachings? Did Paul seriously consider the council as authoritative and binding? I don't know, Pauls own writings don't give us any positive affirmation of the council.

Russian Orthodox Allegiance Crisis,spinfluffy,1602495705,"I live in Australia and our local Russian Orthodox Church belongs to the ROCA (Russian Orthodox Church Abroad). 
At some point in 2007 the head office of this branch (in USA) joined up to the Moscow Patriarchate. And then some of the priests in ROCA split off as they didn’t want to join. So now I’m concerned that my local parish is not part of Moscow. Or even how authentic it is and if anything I do at this church would be recognised internationally. 

Then Moscow also split from Constantinople, so there’s a problem there. Who is Moscow still in communion with? Not a concern if you live in Russia but it is if you live in Australia.

I was living on Mt Athos and Christ came to me..,Andrew-the-Fool,1602465011,"I am only writing this so that some may be edified. A few years ago I was living for some time on Mt Athos. I am writing this to tell the truth of what happened there to me. Many wondrous things happened to me and I could fill a small book with them and maybe some day I will if God wills. 

One night before I was getting ready to leave the mountain I was invited by a Priestmonk from America that had been living there for 20 years to come with him to a Liturgy served in a small church outside the walls of the monastery dedicated to St George. I was very excited to attend and I met the Father and one other monk at 4:00 am. We walked together silently out of the walls of the monastery and down to the shore of the sea as the small church was located directly on a small cliff overlooking the bay and the next peninsula to the one Holy Mt Athos is on. We went into the church silently and I was asked to read some of the service in English and we participated in the Liturgy just the three of us. As we stepped out of the church at the end of the service we all gasped as we looked across the bay to the neighboring peninsula. The normally glass still water was very very rough and huge waves were breaking on the shor below us. I had spent many months there and had never seen the water like that. As I looked out over the way to our shock a huge many mile long forest fire had broken out in the hour and half that we had been in the church.. the forest on the other side of the bay was a massive wall of flame and I could see entire trees exploding in flame and walls of flame moving like a avalanche down the shore. As I sucked in my breath I heard Christ say "" The world is burning but fear not for I am with you.."" I felt a peace there in that moment that I have never felt before .

As I watch the world seemingly burning around me I always take extreme comfort in this .",OrthodoxChristianity

Confessed for the first time,Uw_Kameraad,1602430607,"Greetings, brothers and sisters in Christ! May peace be upon you.

Wednesday, after attending the Vespers (I was the only one in attendance, nobody else in the church besides the priest and I.), I asked the priest if I could make a confession. I am a 16 year old catechumen, and therefore I cannot receive the Holy Mystery tied to confession, which the priest promptly told me. However, I am glad he allowed me to confess nonetheless. A few days prior to confessing, I mentally prepared myself and reflected upon myself, trying to think back to every sin I have committed in my 16 year life. It certainly wasn't easy facing some of the horrors I have inflicted upon myself and upon others, but confessing this to Christ in the presence of the priest has certainly made me feel relieved of a great burden. 

A conversation ensued, in which the priest gave me great advice, comparable to that of a father, which I personally never had. Step by step, I start to feel more at home in Orthodoxy. I am convinced, even though my knowledge of the Church and of Christ is severely limited, that Orthodoxy truly is the only true church. This understanding however, makes me sad too, for the precious time I have wasted, and for the people around me that do not have this understanding and knowledge of the truth. Take for example my mother, who was raised a catholic, later deceived by Mormons, ultimately left religion as a whole, and now lives completely detached from the faith. She is not an atheist, for her faith still lives, but it has been perverted and damaged. The fact that my mother and I do not share our faith pains me. I see her live a sinful life, something which rubs off on me at times, and fear for her salvation. I just wish that she would follow me in my journey, but she will not, at least not now. I honestly am asking for advice her, brothers and sisters, how can I make her see the light? Soon I will be living with her again, and I just want her to follow me in my journey. I love my mother, and I do not want to see her perish, whether it be in this life or that what comes after it..

"Orthodox, separated from terrible marriage, struggling with SSA",Nice-Butterscotch352,1602373248,"I’ve been Orthodox for over a year after a three year catechumenate from a hodgepodge of Protestant traditions. My five year marriage (my second marriage after being a teen bride the first time) has been rotten from the start. There’s been violence, infidelity with prostitutes, verbal abuse, daily substance abuse, financial abuse, and inability to hold a job due to mental health issues. Of course it’s not all bad and there have been bright spots too, but they’ve been few and far between in the last year. Our counselor told us our marriage was dead, after two years of counseling. It finally came to a head and we are separated now, not divorced because our priest doesn’t want us to. We have three young children together. 

I want to be a good Christian. I don’t feel much about it, and I’m probably rather a worldly Christian. I go through the steps of prayer and fasting and liturgy attendance. It’s meaningful to me although I don’t have much of a spiritual sense or even an awareness or presence day to day. But I want to. I want to believe that Jesus really is God the Son who came to reconcile us to Father God. I want to believe that God hears my prayers, and has a design for all of history leading to His triumphant return. I want to believe that all the miracles I’ve learned are legitimate and serve to point the way to God. That the saints are praying for us and we will be united one day. I want to fulfill whatever Christian obligation I have toward my spouse. But I am not willing to stay in it and teach the kids that this is how a marriage should be. 

I’m becoming increasingly distracted by feelings of same sex attraction. I knew I felt this way in my early 20s but thought all women had these thoughts and just didn’t talk about them. I’ve never acted on them, aside from one kiss on a dare half a lifetime ago. I think my Christianity, by God’s grace to my sanctification, has really kept me from leaping into an awareness of my proclivities. I’ve become more aware of them in times of separation, from the former marriage and now. I don’t want to label myself as the world would define me. But I am craving some close female friendships at this phase in my life. I’ve subconsciously pushed them away for so long for fear of becoming attracted. I need godly women in my life. If I had told my friends what was really going on with my then-fiancé five years ago, they wouldn’t have encouraged this marriage. Perhaps I knew that and that’s why I didn’t share. My relationship with my own sister is difficult and distant, but I would love to have a relationship like I’ve seen other sisters have. And increasingly I’m wondering if it’s possible to have a celibate lifetime best friend relationship, or if that’s just playing with fire. If I can’t have male friends or female friends because both might result in attraction, that leaves me very lonely. I’m so lonely being where I am.

I'm not Christian but a friend of mine is. He is Anglican but likes orthodoxy.

He doesn't know where to check, and I don't have much idea about orthodoxy or Christianity in general. He'd like to know if the Monastery linked below is Orthodox or 'Orthodox'. I think he means by this if the Monastery is linked to a patriarch or not. 

I checked some videos in YouTube and seems that male members of the Monastery meet the female members of another Monastery nearby and go with a boat in a lake or sea. Not sure if it is orthodox but after I checked the Orthodox Church channel in Youtube and I haven't found anything similar.

\-- Who were Noah's grandkids?

\- Create relationships between places / times / documents

Why should I care what the fathers believed about scripture?,MarysDowry,1602296107,"Provocative attention grabbing title out the way, my question is, why should I prioritise the opinions of the holy Fathers over any other kind of exegesis (historical, textual, archaeological etc)?

I will try to explain myself best here, so hopefully it makes enough sense.

My confusion with the Orthodox approach comes from the fact that for most issues outside of the major tenets (to be truthful, even in the major areas of doctrine there was significant debate and disagreement), you can find church fathers that hold just about every opinion under the sun.

The Orthodox approach seems to rest on the presupposition that the fathers were in some way divinely inspired in their reading and exegesis of scripture. This is where I find the problem.

The issue I have comes from the fact that there are many mutually exclusive systems of theology. St Isaac/Gregory of Nyssa cannot be equally as inspired as say Jerome or Augustine because it would make the spirit a deciever. If the spirit is inspiring these authors on specific issues, they surely must come to some kind of agreement, but they do not. The entire eschatological picture varies so much between different fathers that you would be hard pressed to recognise them as the same religion if you read their ideas without context.

You could say that one side of the debate was inspired and the others were not, but absent some conciliar pronouncement to show us which was which, we have to judge through our personal rational/intellectual capacities.

Now some believe we can find the mind of the spirit by simply surveying the fathers, as if we were doing some kind of religious literature review. But the fact that we have examples of what would later become solidified doctrine being defended by sole or highly minority witness against the majority seems to make that also untenable. These issues are only resolved in hindsight.

These are all legitimate problems, but you may say, ""well, they were holy people intune with the spirit, so they should be trustworthy"". Again, I think the diversity of opinion is a big problem here. St Isaac calls divine retribution utterly blasphemous, whilst other fathers accepted it, should we tally up the saints merits and wonders to see who was more holy?

I'm not sure what the result of all these issues is, but to me it seems like patristics is basically just private interpretation by proxy, but with conciliar decrees at the margins to set the boundaries. 

Now this gets to my real question, why then should I prioritise the writings of people from 1000+ years ago on matters of history, culture and literary analysis over experts from today. If I want to learn about the context of second temple literary styles, why would I go to a greek from 1000AD instead of an expert from the modern day who has built on centuries of study and archaeological findings?

I just find it weird how theres so much emphasis on reading the fathers and from what I can tell theres very little emphasis put on modern scholarship. Maybe you'll find it in the more academic writings, but at the popular level its basically just rehashing the fathers. 

If I want to know about genesis, why would I not want to study those who have the benefit of the ugarit excavations, who can read hieroglyphics, who can compare with various ancient near eastern creation texts? 

An interesting article on ugarit:

https://blog.obitel-minsk.com/2020/07/the-bible-and-the-ugaritic-literature.html

This is kind of veering from my original question, but its relevant, why do Orthodox seemingly place so little emphasis on biblical scholarship? I just don't understand why we should seek to prioritse the patristic texts, outside of spiritual counsel. If you want to understand the spiritual meaning of a text, go to the fathers (I still think the cultural/historical context is highly important), but if you want to know whether genesis was intended as literal for example, why go to them?",OrthodoxChristianity

My progress(delayed update),OrthoNationalist,1602286205,"Hello brothers and sisters in Christ, it has been quite a long while since my last update(close to a year now) under a different account. I was originally kicked out of my home because of my intent to convert from Roman Catholicism to Orthodoxy, which my father was not happy about. I thank Our Lord for the fact that after a little more than a month away, my father invited me back home as he missed me and felt wrong about pushing me away. We still have tension whenever our faith is brought up but still love each other and get along well. 

For the past several months my closest parish friends had been working to get my chrismation date set up because of us no longer having a permanent priest and COVID restrictions. Today was my first confession in Orthodoxy and my chrismation is on Sunday, which I'm ecstatic about! I had been under constant and grueling temptations since my chrismation had been drawing closer so I have made some mistakes I'm not proud of. Confession today really helped lift a weight off my shoulders and the priest gave me lovely words of wisdom. Glory to God that men greater than I are around to help me draw closer to Our Lord Jesus Christ!

A past action that I had committed beforehand has come back to bite me however.. I had to confront my past decision with a young woman who had been going through a lot and I had been helping her deal with the mental instability in her life. She had become very ""friendly"" towards me and while we didn't do the full ""deed"", I felt that I was still too intimate(nothing explicit) with this person right when she was even starting to ask questions about Orthodoxy. Not only was I a hypocrite for this, but because I told her that I was out of line she is now hurt and doesn't want to speak with me. I feel much regret even after feeling better after my confession today. I don't feel like I've committed a sin by telling her that I was wrong, but it makes me still feel bad for possibly making her feel inadequate. I'm afraid that I may have pushed her away from God because of my stupidity and weakness to lust. I should have stayed strong and been a better example to her on what restraint was. Sorry for this long rant. I'm extremely happy about my coming chrismation but also feel sad for potentially leading this woman on due to my own personal weakness.

Someone please educate me on Orthodox beliefs.,ellendegenerate96,1602265093,"So I was born in Egypt and I was baptized as a baby (Coptic Orthodox Christian). I had never read the Bible and I rarely went to church growing up. Recently, however I started to read the Bible and I became born-again and I’ve fully surrendered my life to Christ and it is the greatest decision I’ve ever made. 

After reading my Bible, I began to understand things that aren’t typically taught in the CopticOrthodox Church (e.g., Jesus having brothers, Mary not staying a Virgin after the birth of Jesus (Matthew 1:25), etc.) 

I had a discussion with my family about some of these things and they said that I was reading a “corrupted Bible” (I was reading the NASB version, the closest to the original translation). They told me that the Coptic church is the “mother church” and everything it teaches is the truth, so I started researching for what exactly the Coptic Church believes in and I haven’t found much. 

I’d say a few things that I see my family doing a lot is asking the saints or Mary to intercede in prayers and, to be completely honest, it doesn’t sit well in my spirit to ask anyone but Jesus Christ to intercede for us (Romans 8:26-27). Also I see that it is a common practice in the Coptic Church to “anoint” icons with oil and to kiss those icons in order to get a blessing. Is this not idolatry? (Exodus 20:4-6). 

A lot of Copts will say that the Bible alone is not enough, but that the writings of the early church fathers are of equal authority. What and who do I believe?

What is the Eastern Orthodox position on the Pericope Adulterae?,TurquoiseRodent,1602221042,"The ""Pericope Adulterae"" is the passage John 7:53 – 8:11. Most contemporary biblical scholars believe that it was not in the original manuscripts of the Gospel of John.

Some (mainly Protestants) view divine inspiration as only attaching to the original manuscripts and hence argue that if it wasn't in the original it isn't divinely inspired. By contrast, others argue that the Church's tradition of accepting the passage testifies to its divine inspiration, and what matters for divine inspiration is whether the Church comes to accept a work as divinely inspired, not what its original manuscripts were. (Even supposing the Pericope Adulterae was originally an independent ""mini-gospel"" which was later inserted into John, it may be that ""mini-gospel"" was just as inspired as the rest of John is.)

"Meaning of Canon CIX. “Whoso shall assert that the protoplast would have died without sin and through natural necessity, let him be anathema.“",Lord_Have_Mercy123,1602182434,"&gt;Canon CIX. (Greek cxij. continued.) That Adam was not created by God subject to death. That whosoever says that Adam, the first man, was created mortal, so that whether he had sinned or not, he would have died in body-that is, he would have gone forth of the body, not because his sin merited this, but by natural necessity, let him be anathema.

&gt;Ancient Epitome of Canon CIX. Whoso shall assert that the protoplast would have died without sin and through natural necessity, let him be anathema. Canon CVlH. is the introduction to the Synod of Carthage of May 1, a.d. 418; and Canon CIX. is Canon j. of that synod.

&gt;Canon CIX of Carthage accepted at Trullo, which Trullo was then accepted at Nice. II. The anathemizatation of bodily death before the fall.

A recent post and a commenter on that post brought up the topic of death before the fall, and its relation to the sacred canons and scriptures, deeming it anathema. I am aware of no official condemnation of evolution and no official declaration of TE as anathema. I am not a member of even minor orders, and I am definitely not a canon lawyer. So there must be a way to reconcile what is being said here with biological evolution, lest evolution be anathema, which it isn’t.

I must ask, what is the meaning of “(. . .) the protoplast would have died without sin and through natural necessity (. . .)”? Is this referring to man exclusively, to all animal life or to all life period? Does this canon anathemize the general concept of bodily death before the fall? Animal death? Plant death? Fungal death? Bacterial death? Cell death? Presumably Adam and Eve ate plants necessitating, at minimum, cell death. Assuming they ate fruits, these plants would have been the equivalent of fertilized eggs (flowers only develop into fruits with sweet flesh after fertilization), thus necessitating the death of a whole organism. Every time we eat a fruit, we’re essentially aborting a plant, and Genesis flat out tells us Adam and Eve were eating fruits, so it seems we would have to throw out not just evolution, but even basic biological facts accepted by YECs such as flowers generating into fruits after fertilization. But this won’t do. We would, in addition, have to throw out the cell theory, as even this would require the death of individual cells. So the question is not that there was no death before the fall, but at what point does death constitute becoming worthy of anathemization, and that is not a question I know the answer to. Even if we conceive as a vegan Adam and Eve, they would have been killing plants. So death before the fall exists under a YEC view as well. According to a literal interpretation of this canon, we are all anathema - even the YECs! Because “(. . .) the protoplast would have died without sin and through natural necessity (. . .)”. So is it only animal life? It would seem not. Did predators exist? Presumably no predators existed then, but this seems impossible. Not even spiders and scorpions? Birds? We can’t really know. No ecumenical counsel has been called to make a statement on this, and none probably ever will.

But this doesn’t solve the fundamental tension. If TE necessitates animal death before the fall, which it does in my view if we are to avoid Gnosticism - that Adam and Eve were made in some immaterial Eden where every animal was vegan, then it seems that this canon must only be referring to human death and the special creation of Man, which is fully compatible with evolution. A lack of Animal death, in my view, is simply not unless we accept a gnostic notion of Eden. Where, then, are we left?

How are we to interpret the meaning of this canon?

Validity of Roman Catholicism,IrishAmerican4,1602159979,"Hi everyone.

What is the opinion and consensus regarding the validity of the RCC? Catholics regard EO sacraments, ordinations, and pretty much everything about you all to be 100% valid but obviously not licit for Catholics. For example, we believe you also have the real presence at Eucharist. This is unique in that Catholics do not believe any Protestant Church has valid sacraments.

"What is a Protestant church service like, from an Orthodox perspective?",cherryloaf,1602152186,"Howdy. I've been Orthodox for long enough to know better than I do (lol), I've never really practiced any other religion. I was Catholic in name for a while before I figured things out, because my family is more Catholic than Orthodox, I've been to a few Catholic masses in my life and I think that they're a respectable form of worship even if not Orthodox. 

I've never really been to a Protestant church and I'm curious what goes on at them, from an Orthodox perspective. Like, we have Liturgies and services like Matins and Vespers, all of which I see meaning and purpose in. I know that low-church Protestants don't have these kinds of services. The only high-church Protestants I can think of are Anglicans and Lutherans, but I've heard all sorts of things about them, some are apparently as low-church as the average Baptists are.

So, what's it like for a Baptist church? Methodist? Non-denominational Protestant? Lutheran? Anglican?

Is it just a sermon? Do they yell and damn people to hell or are they actually pretty good in terms of content? That question might sound ignorant, but it's what I've seen on YouTube and in movies, so that's why I'm asking. Is there singing and dancing? Do they have hymns? Do they read prayers? Is there a lot of Bible reading? Is there any sacred space? How do they usually view Catholics and Orthodox, if they even know anything about us? Do they tend to know about early church history?",OrthodoxChristianity
My Journey to Orthodoxy,NikitasMathias,1602148015,"This is supposed to be a summary of my long journey on how I came to Christ and, more specifically, Orthodoxy.

My journey first started when I tried to develop a sincere relationship and connection with God. At that time, I was still a Muslim. A Sunni Muslim who was trying to get closer to God. One of the problems with this in Islam is that there is no personal relationship with God. There is only closeness in piety. At that point in time, I would spend time hanging out with my friends and sometimes also hangout with my friend, F, alone. F was my best friend. Plus, I would like it more when it was just me and F. We would go on a walk and discuss our life problems, aspirations, dreams, religion, history, and politics. Well, it was mostly me talking and explaining with F giving his opinions or objections. Regardless, we always had a nice time.

After that, I would go home and listen to some Islamic podcasts. Sometimes, do my Islamic prayers of which I was supposed to anyways. In Islam, the person would be considered damned to Hell if they did not do their prayers. Sometimes later, I would also watch apolgetic videos against critics of Islam. Eventually, I had hopped on Discord. F had introduced me to it a while back but I did not really look into it as much. I decided to give it another try. When I first did, I would discuss politics on Discord. Later on, I moved to apologetics against critics of Islam myself. At some point, I had realized that all that I knew about Islam was from what I was taught in school or from my parents, or from sermons at the Mosque, or stories I would hear or from a Scholar, Imam, or Sheikh that would come to my house every Friday and give me lessons on Islam. Nothing was from me alone looking at the resources themselves, it was always from other people.  What I came to realize later on is that most of the stuff that I was told were lies. Not the people necessarily that taught me lied to me; it was either the person who taught them did not give them the full details or would romanticize the story that was derived from the Quran or Hadith. Regardless, in transmission, the true story was lost and watered down to common folklore. When I came across the main Quranic passages and its Tafsir (commentary by old scholars or Imams, I refer to them as Mosque Fathers) and also Hadiths on them, what I found was completely different. Not necessarily wrong but there were details left out and some dropped completely out of transmission. What was found was completely barbaric, was completely different and radical to the faith I had known and grew up with.

Without going into much detail to my findings which I have saved for apologetics (you could ask me personally), I found so much contradictory information to the Islam I had known with also regards to the deep theological flaws and textual reliability when it comes to preservation and textual variance. I had found out that the Quran and all other Islamic traditions and resources were unreliable. I had now viewed Islam as a false religion and faith and deemed it as an international cult. It took me a couple of days to let that new piece of information set in. A couple of days later, I had decided to share that information with my friend. After almost a week of research and fact checking, he left Islam too. After a while, he accepted Christ while I was somewhat of a Jew. Though after looking further into the Jewish Torah, I found that the Christian Old Testament was more reliable than variable that the Jewish Torah had; among other stuff that I had deemed evil in the Jewish Talmud. Moving forward, checking the prophecies that had been present in the Old Testament, and upon reading the New Testament, I had come to realize and see the truth. The truth which I had later on formally accepted Christ as the Messiah and that Christ is Lord. As soon as I had accepted Christ in my heart, I had felt as if a chain I had over my heart had softly broke and that I was free of my burdens.

Yet still, at this point, I had not found Orthodoxy. I still had a lot to learn and understand which denomination I should choose to be part of and how I was going to join living in an Islamic country as well as being from an Islamic family. Regardless, after months of looking into different denominations, faiths, and expressions, even historic ones, and even by the help of other people and friends, I had found Orthodoxy-- the One and only True church. Now, I had a bigger task at hand: how will I join the church and how will I try to join it? And how will I do it in an Islamic country and how would I live an Orthodox Christian life with a family that has abused me for years prior to my conversion? That of which only got a lot worse after my conversion. In months of trying to contact Clergymen and Bishops in my homeland and seeking advice from Clergy abroad, I did not get much regard or replies. But I would still be able to talk to my fellow Orthodox friends online. We would do prayers together and talk. I would be given more resources to look through on theology and history. Eventually, I had made it to America for vacation. That's when things got aggressive with my family. I was whipped for not doing my Islamic prayers and received a lot more abuse. I was starting to get exposed. My parents were finding out that I was a Christian. Some of you would know that the punishment for leaving Islam is death; and for blasphemy, which is basically leaving Islam and doing stuff that would be regarded as blasphemous, would be crucifixion.

Nearing the end of my trip, and nearing the complete exposure of my faith, I was told by my parents that I would face full Sharia Law upon my arrival to my homeland. Which would be death by crucifixion. I was on the path to martyrdom and death. I had known it might come to this from the beginning but I could not deny Christ. So I went in and said my goodbyes to my friends. Eventually, they together organized a plan to save my life and extract me. To help me live here in America. After a couple weeks of planning and executing them by the grace of God, I made it out and later after that was able to join the church. I thank the Lord to this day and I ask him to forgive my parents for they do not know what they did.

And this is my journey to Orthodoxy. I left a lot of details out due to the longevity of this story. It would take an entire series of books to put down and this is supposed to be a summary. God bless you and keep you strong in faith and never lose faith in Christ.",OrthodoxChristianity

Question pertaining to civil marriages and children,dotjpegdotcom,1602132983,"My husband and I ran into some issues at the start of our relationship with his family 6.5 years ago and ultimately resulted in us having a civil wedding.

It's since been 4 years and since money had been tight for a while, nor did family have the funds to help any longer, so put we it off and decided we would get married in the church this year before we had children. Unfortunately, covid hit and I ended up with child.

I've never been opposed to getting married in the church, quite the contrary. Just not in the midst of a pandemic with child where I and elderly family members run the risk of being exposed. My mother in law is now upset telling us that we are having a child out of wedlock and our child will pay for our sins. I personally don't believe that considering the fact that we need a civil wedding in the first place for it to be recognized in the church.

Attacks on Orthodox Christians,mindyana,1602120520,"hi guys, I didn't want to make this a large post but I thought I would just put it here. I've been feeling very anxious about this and wondering if it means anything. In Ethiopia (where there is a very large Orthodox Christian population) there has basically been targeted killings(genocide/ethnic cleansing) of the ethnic group most associated with Orthodox Christianity, as well as other Orthodox Christians from the attacking ethnic group who are majority muslim (and some protestant) (they say their Orthodox fate makes them more like the other ethnicity even to the ppl of their own ethnic group) [Reference Here](http://www.spc.rs/eng/genocide_orthodox_christians_and_minorities_ethiopia). 

Now, I see that Armenia is also facing attack from Azebarjian and Armenia is also one of the places left of Orthodoxy. Armenians have faced genocide in the past and most people are very concerned by the attacks that two larger stronger nations who are also majority muslim are doing on Armenia. My heart is with both the nations. I need to learn more to hand concerns over to God as an Orthodox but I just thought this was an interesting parallel and a representative that we are in trying times and that our faith is under attack so we must practice with more vigor.

Does God's giving hand have to be a monkey's paw?,Shaikidow,1602099916,"Hello everyone, fellow Orthodox Christian here.

I'm seeking help with prayer, because I keep limiting it due to fear and I think that's what makes it way less effective, if not outright ineffective.

Generally, I feel that there is a lot of chaos due to a newfound lack of structure (and job, and personal money, and family extension on my behalf) ever since I got my Master's Degree at the local faculty of arts (I'm a musician, so jobs are harder than ever to come by, due to how everything's happening this year).

Now, the way I see it, in order to be able to carry my cross, I should accept my suffering until the perseverance makes me tough enough to bear the burdens of my life actively instead of passively (i. e. facing the dangers and adversities of life bravely head-on, instead of avoiding any and all possibilities of hurting anyone or getting hurt myself).

However, whenever I want to pray to God about it and tell Him that I wish to become a tough guy instead of the coward that I perceive I currently am, the idea comes to me that, being so willing and unwilling to change at the same time, it would take a drastic, brutal change for my wish to be fulfilled (and I imagine that my wish ultimately isn't against God's will, because why wouldn't He want His children to grow up well?), and since that's also exactly what I fear, I can never manage to pray for that wholeheartedly.

The thought that then comes to me is always something like, ""Okay, I believe He can make me tough, but it's gonna come at the price of something big that I love and don't want to let go of, even if I can ultimately bear it; for example, I might have to lose an eye or an arm or a leg, or even one or both of my parents (since I often feel they're holding me back from truly growing up, as loving as they are), and that's gonna make me wrathful towards God, even though I might ultimately accept it all.""

I'm nowhere near Job's level of faith, and I don't want my wishes to play any part in me getting mutilated or killing my loved ones, so I end up half-assing my wish or presenting it with a condition: ""Please toughen me out, but if that means that You have to irreversibly hurt me or my parents or even my cats or anyone physically, please don't do that after all""... and then I never see any progress.

"""It does no harm to esteem yourself less than anyone else, but it is very harmful to think yourself better than even one.""",Epimenides_of_Crete,1602050147,"Vain is the man who puts his trust in men, in created things. 
Do not be ashamed to serve others for the love of Jesus Christ and to seem poor in this world. Do not be self-sufficient but place your trust in God. Do what lies in your power and God will aid your good will. Put no trust in your own learning nor in the cunning of any man, but rather in the grace of God Who helps the humble and humbles the proud. 

If you have wealth, do not glory in it, nor in friends because they are powerful, but in God Who gives all things and Who desires above all to give Himself. Do not boast of personal stature or of physical beauty, qualities which are marred and destroyed by a little sickness. Do not take pride in your talent or ability, lest you displease God to Whom belongs all the natural gifts that you have. 

Do not think yourself better than others lest, perhaps, you be accounted worse before God Who knows what is in man. Do not take pride in your good deeds, for God's judgments differ from those of men and what pleases them often displeases Him. If there is good in you, see more good in others, so that you may remain humble. It does no harm to esteem yourself less than anyone else, but it is very harmful to think yourself better than even one.

1. Did the Portuguese colonist try to destroy Malankara Orthodoxy in Kerala? Why?

Am I going to hell because my Parish is on the New Calendar?,Lord_Have_Mercy123,1602020165,"https://pravoslavie.ru/90482.html

According to this article the new calendarists commit numerous liturgical transgressions.

“See where violation of the Canons regarding the time for celebrating Pascha leads. From the aforementioned canonical prescriptions of the Orthodox Church it is clear that we must uphold them reverently, without any alteration. For this reason, the Twenty-ﬁrst Canon of the Synod in Gangra says:

We wish that all things which have been handed down by the Divine Scriptures and the Apostolic Traditions be observed in the Church.

And the Second Canon of the Sixth Œcumenical Synod:

That no one be allowed to falsify or set aside the aforementioned Canons [of the Apostles, of the Œcumenical and Local Synods, and of the Holy Fathers], or to accept any Canons other than those herein speciﬁed, which have been composed under a spurious inscription by certain persons who have attempted to traffic in the truth.

Such a steadfast and undeviating upholding of the Canons is demanded by the Seventh Œcumenical Synod, the First Canon of which states:

We gladly embrace the Divine Canons and hold fast all the precepts of the same, complete and without change, whether they have been set forth by those clarions of the Spirit, the all-laudable Apostles, or by the Six Œcumenical Synods, or by Synods locally assembled for promulgating such decrees, or by our Holy Fathers; for all these, being illumined by the same Spirit, ordained such things as were expedient; and those whom they placed under anathema, we likewise anathematize; those whom they deposed, we also depose; those whom they excommunicated, we also excommunicate...

From all of the aforementioned canonical prescriptions it is evident to what a great sin the Roman Catholics fell when they overturned the Sacred Canons, which forbid us to celebrate Pascha along with the Jews. This is the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which God does not forgive, either in the present life or in the life to come. For, the same Holy Spirit, God, speaks through the Sacred Canons, because the canonical, as well as the dogmatic, prescriptions of the Œcumenical Synods were composed in accordance with the words of Divine Scripture: “It seemed pleasing to the Holy Spirit and to us.”*

And the Divine Spirit, through the Apostles, the Œcumenical Synods, and the Holy Fathers, did not ordain canonical truths in order that we might subsequently correct and alter them, as being, supposedly, imperfect and erroneous. Such an attitude towards the Sacred Canons is completely unacceptable and blasphemous.”

I love Jesus so much but I struggle a lot with the concept of the Trinity,Zach8171,1602016234,"Greetings! 

I love Jesus and I believe in the virgin birth. When I read the Gospel I feel deeply touched and filled with love. I love His radical teachings and His message of love, especially Sermon on the Mount. I believe He is in some way divine, there is no doubt about it. However, I struggle a lot with the concept of the Trinity. Polytheism is disgusting, abhorrent, and evil. I have tried to reconcile my strong monotheistic faith with the concept of Trinity but I struggle a lot with it, it seems to be impossible. God is one.

I strongly believe that Jesus is divine, but it feels wrong to  worship Him as a hypostasis of God. To be a Son of God does not equate that one is God. Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God, but I doubt the trinitarian claim that He is God incarnate. Thus, I guess I would qualify as an Arian? For me, God is invisible. I cannot visualise Him as three “persons” sitting on three thrones in Heaven. No, to me that is idolatry and polytheism. 

I have considered converting to Judaism or Islam but I love Jesus and His teachings so much. Jesus is love.

I want to understand the Trinity. Please do not tell me it is a mystery beyond human comprehension. I have heard that so many times and I cannot accept it. For in the Bible we read: “Come, let us reason together”.

Please help me. I want to be a faithful Christian. I want to connect with other Christians. I want to love God and Jesus with all my heart and soul. Please help me understand the concept of the Trinity.

The protestants ruined it!,Uw_Kameraad,1601898142,"I cannot seem to express my anger enough. The protestants have ruined everything once again.

A little bit of background info, I live in the Netherlands, where until today, churches were exempt from very harsh corona-measures. You can already read it, until today. About 2 Sundays back, a reformed church in the Netherlands held a service with over 600 people, completely disregarding the slightest 1,5m distance measure. They even sang, something which was advised against. The Minister of Security and Justice just announced that, due to this event, the maximum amount of faithful allowed at the services will be fixed to thirty. This means that the already long waiting lists to attend Liturgy will be even longer. My parish is small and strictly adheres to the 1,5 meter distance rule. We literally take turns to go to Liturgy.

Why is it that all churches are practically punished now, following the roundout foolish actions of these protestants? I should have a little more mercy on them, but I just cannot.

Doubting the eucharist,MarysDowry,1601875387,"One of my biggest stumbling blocks at the moment with Orthodoxy is the issue of the eucharist, or to be precise, specific understandings of the eucharist.

Trying to find a precise understanding of the eucharist is very difficult for a start, so I expect a lot of disagreement in this thread.

My biggest doubt is over the fact that is literally, as in physically, the body and blood of Christ. What leads me to this doubt is that as much as many may protest, people can and do recieve harm from the eucharist.

I've read quite a few stories of peoples experiences, suffering allergic reactions to the eucharist, I've heard of priests reporting that they can experience the effects of the alcohol if they have to consume a bit too much after a service. 

To me, this all seems fairly predictable if we are to hold some kind of view which posits that the bread is changed in a spiritual sense, whilst still being chemically bread. 

However many people seem to have a problem with this. As an example in the sayings of the deserts fathers it recounts a story of a monk seeing the eucharist turn into literal chunks of flesh after doubting.

One troubling thing is the issue of celiacs. The only high profile response to this question I've seen is from Met Isaiah of denver saying:

""If there are Orthodox Christians in our parishes who believe that, after the Holy Spirit consecrates the Bread and the Wine during the Divine Liturgy, the gifts are still bread and wine, they should never again receive the divine Body and Blood again, until they believe that the holy sacrament of our Lord Himself is His spiritual presence, that is, both His Body and His Blood.

… And, if the doctor's instructions to them about not eating the Body (bread) because of the doctor's medical knowledge are considered more important than the Holy Eucharist, then they should not receive the Holy Eucharist of the Lord, unless or until they believe that the Creator of all has more knowledge regarding eternal life than all the medical science of this fallen world.""

I have heard from various people online and have seen the eucharist in my parish be treated properly for people with celiacs (communing as small amount as possible). Is this Bishop to say that all priests who assented (and by extension the bishops for allowing it) to this are heretics denying the eucharist?

Fr Aidan Kimels article on this topic helped me here, the excerpt his quotes argues that:

""This is a confession which, though radical, is neither simplistic nor naive. **The essential position of the Fathers is to see in the word of the Lord a miracle which is not physical but metaphysical.** “Metaphysics” is used here in the absolute sense of the term, beyond the limits of this world, a meta-cosmic miracle, one that is also meta-empirical. **In reality, the heavenly body of the Lord no longer belongs to the reality of this world.** Its transcendence poses a difference in nature between the eucharistic miracle and, for example, the miracle at the wedding in Cana, where one material, water, became another material, wine, on the same ontological plane and within the same cosmic limits.""

""Above and beyond the experi­ence of the senses, faith affirms absolutely and categorically neither the transub­stan­tiated bread nor the body, nor the bread coexisting beneath the form of bread. Faith rather confesses the bread by the power of the Holy Spirit identified with the body of the Lord. **“This is my body” does not mean: “this bread will become my body in ceasing to be bread.” But without abolishing the sign which signifies, the eucharistic miracle absorbs the contradiction, and in this a miracle remains.""**

""The eucharistic miracle does not make Christ descend from heaven to the altar. “It is not the body which ascended to heaven which descends,” says St John of Damascus, “but the bread and wine which are one with the body and blood of the Lord.” The Encyclical of the Patri­archs of the East says the same thing: “The bread is identified with the heavenly body.” The miracle does not abolish the reality of the Ascension, but expresses a completely new relationship between this world and the heavenly body of the Lord.""

This makes a lot of sense in my mind, but I am not sure whether this is an acceptable theological position.

I think it would be near impossible for me to genuinely believe that the bread is not physically present in its chemical properties. 

On a less empircal note, the fact that the eucharist seems so lackluster to most people leaves me with some doubts too. In the NT we see all sorts of people being healed by just touching Christs garments and having faith in his power. But millions of people take the eucharist and theres no reports of widespread miracles occuring during communion. On the contrary we see people sometimes even being harmed by the eucharist (and example was a child, who physically couldn't lack faith or merit harm). Now if this is truly Christs body, not just his earthly body, but his truly vivified glorious body, should we not see far more miraculous healings than even those of Christs earthly life? 

If we could not imagine a faithful person seeking healing from Jesus during his ministry and coming away harmed, why do we see that with the eucharist, if its supposedly his glorified body literally inside that person?",OrthodoxChristianity
Is John 13 5-17 about Confession?,Lord_Have_Mercy123,1601874833,"“After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded. Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, “Lord, are You washing my feet?” Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know after this.” Peter said to Him, “You shall never wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.” Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you.” For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, “You are not all clean.” So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.”
‭‭John‬ ‭13:5-17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

Since the washing of the feet seems to be also an allegory for cleansing of sin (because Jesus says Peter is unclean because he is about to deny him), and he says that you ‘ought to wash one another’s feet’, is this evidence for confession? And what about the protestant claim that it’s simply about confessing to each other and not about priests per se?",OrthodoxChristianity

Uncertainty in faith (or lack thereof),Cricket_Proud,1601835833,"Hello all, I apologize if this is strange and a bit incoherent, but here goes.

  
I'm a new college student in my University and I've been raised atheist all my life. I have never been to church. After a series of deaths in my family and with our situation with COVID, I feel something in my life missing. I had filled this void with alcohol, but always felt guilt in doing so and eventually found no more solace or enjoyment in it. Two years ago I found my peace by joining a choir and since have felt unusually drawn by the hymns of the Orthodox faith (especially those sung by the Valaam Cultural Institute), often times moving me to tears. I feel a connection in this music and in these words stronger than anything I've felt before, which I can only assume is faith.

No church - A situation I never imagined.,bitnil,1601807801,"Hello everyone,

So I would like opinions regarding a complicated situation that I may be very likely to fall in. And yes, I have spoken to multiple priests about this, and their advice was all along the lines of ***""do whatever you can""*** they have neither advised for or against it. 

Lately on this sub, there has been a trend of people asking for advise, because there is no church in their city etc, etc. Well my situation is kind of related, but in my case we have to turn up the notch several times. My entire country has no Orthodox church, and no Orthodox people either. While I don't live there right now, recent circumstances and situations mean that I might have to move back there soon (perhaps sometime next year). That is the general nature of this post, now I'll go in to the more specific details.

**Now my reasons for going back are quite complex, but it boils down to 4 main things:**

* Finances: My finances are going down, and I can't afford to live here anymore (Europe).
* Health: My health is also bad, and seems to be getting worse. Due to this I can hardly do any work, which makes the previous point more complicated. I have a number of issues, including chronic pain. In simple terms, it's excruciatingly painful for me to do simple things, like taking a shower for example.
* Weather: The cold weather here in Europe also makes my health worse in various ways.
* Family problems: Various, it seems we could all use each others help right now.
* Other failures: In various attempts to live close to church, I have also tried living in 5 other countries in the past 10 years; this has always failed for various reasons. I also wanted to be a monk (I always had an attraction to church and monastic life). I was in a monastery few times, but each time I left as I could not cope with the monastic schedule due to my health issues.

I am quite dissapointed, but I have tried everything humanly possible to be close to a church for over 10 years now, and it's not working. God isn't giving me a miracle for this either, so I can only do what I can. Maybe you people here can suggest some advice or tips that I did not think about?

**1) When I do move, this is how I will handle church issues:**

* Maintain my prayer rule, which is rather large and complicated.
* I know a priest who is willing to do confessions by phone whenever I need.
* Depending on my budget, 1-4 times a year I can travel to another country for a couple weeks and attend church there.
* If this situation continues, I'll have to make special arrangements for my funeral, whether that means getting a priest to come for the funeral, or transporting my body somewhere else. Either way I'll have to be in cold storage for quite a while.

**I have also investigated the possibility of establishing a mission**, but that is unlikely to happen. My mother and I would be the only Orthodox people in the country. Reality is no church will establish a mission for only 2 people, unless we get more converts, and without an actual church it's very hard to get converts in the first place. Also the country involved has no interest in Orthodoxy. And I don't really have the strength and resources to become a priest and start a mission myself.

**2) God willing there can be other changes too.**

* Maybe after some time, I would be able to move to another country and live close to a church after all.
* If I'm lucky, then my health could also recover and I could return to a monastery and become a monk.

But for now my focus is on the previous points (1). Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.

Question regarding finding a spiritual mother ...,Nonna62021,1601688844,"Hi! 

So I’ve been attempting to find a spiritual mother. I currently don’t have a spiritual father or mother, and thus I haven’t had the opportunity for confession lately. In the past my husband invited me to join him on his visits to his own spiritual father...but for personal reasons I would just prefer to find my own confessor. A lot of priests and others know us in our community, and I’m just a more private individual and I don’t really want to seek advice from my husband’s mentors. I also would prefer the input of a monastic in place of my husband’s spiritual fathers and mentors -they just seem to have more relaxed opinions than I would prefer. (and we are also Orthodox Converts, so I was hesitant about confessions in the past. Catholic PTSD, as I prefer to joke). 

However, the only monastery near us happens to just be a schismatic one... at first I was very excited since it’s a monastery just for nuns, and then I realized they were schismatic.... would it be incredibly heretical for me to still seek counsel there for a short time? My husband and I are moving abroad next summer and we will be moving right next to a monastery with monks and nuns, so I’m hoping to find a long term spiritual mother there... but I have no one to speak to until then.

10 guidelines for Christian living,Faithful2087,1601678310,"&amp;#x200B;

1. Read your Bible daily. Do not be content to skim through a chapter merely to satisfy your conscience. Hide the word of God in your heart. It comforts, guides, corrects, encourages – all we need is there.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Learn the secret of prayer. Prayer is communicating. Every prayer that you pray will be answered. Sometimes that answer may be “yes” and sometimes “no,” and sometimes it is “wait,” but nevertheless it will be answered.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Rely constantly on the Holy Spirit. We know that the Holy Spirit intercedes for us (Romans 8:26), and what a comfort that should be to the weakest of us. Stand aside and let him take over all the choices and decisions of your life.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Attend other Christians regularly. Christians need one another.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Be a witnessing Christian.  We witness in two ways: by life and by word – and the two, where possible, must go hand in hand.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Let love be the ruling principle of your life. Jesus said to those who followed him, “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another” (John 13:35). The greatest demonstration of the fact that we are Christians is that we love one another.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Be an obedient Christian. Let Christ have first place in all the choices of your life.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Learn how to meet temptation. Temptation in itself is not sin. Taking negative pleasure in thoughts is sin. Let Christ through the Holy Spirit do the fighting for you.

&amp;#x200B;

9. Be a wholesome Christian. Our lives and appearance should commend the Gospel and make it attractive to others.

&amp;#x200B;

10. Live above your circumstances. Don’t let your circumstances get you down. Learn to live graciously within them, realizing God is with you.",OrthodoxChristianity

I’m a Christian lay-pastor that seems to be on my way out of my current denomination as a Seventh-day Adventist.

For the last few months iv slowly been discovering Asceticism, and have been really drawn to the idea of it, yet while not being too inclined to practice it in an extreme sense.

I know that Asceticism isn’t exclusively Orthodox, but it does seem to have an emphasis in Orthodoxy, from what I can tell.

However, the thing that’s stopping me from taking further steps towards Orthodox Christianity, is that I don’t understand the strange dress codes and appearance of the church.

I don’t see what those black robes, jewelry, and big hats have to do with Christ, and Orthodoxy seems to be bogged down by an excessive amount of church culture and tradition. The paintings, it’s music, dress and traditions..

I guess I’m starting to approach Christianity from a purist point of view, and coming from a church (SDA) that bogs itself down in its own identity, im hesitant to enter another one that does the same..

Essence-energies distinction in the Church fathers.,SeraphimRose33,1601613823,"The essence-energies distinction is a crucial part of our theology that you must understand. I will first give a brief definition of what it is, then I will link two articles that compile quotes from the church fathers on the essence-energies distinction.

It is - as is self-evident by the name - a distinction between the essence and the energies of God. The important point being made here is that while God is unknowable in His essence, He can be known in His energies. This is also why we believe in theosis, but not the heretical apotheosis, ""Deification in God’s Essence"", which is imparticipable.

The scholastic claim that God is actus purus is incompatible with the essence–energies distinction. Christos Yannaras says, ""The West confuses God's essence with his energy, regarding the energy as a property of the divine essence and interpreting the latter as ""pure energy"" (actus purus)"".

Old Testament Saints,ChicagoCath89,1601595044,"Hi, I am a Catholic but I am trying to come up with a list of Old Testament saints. I came up with the following and am looking for feedback. The Eastern Churches, for whatever reason, have tended to pay more attention to and celebrate and venerate Old Testament saints more, so I thought it would be good to ask this here too.

Basically,  I took a list of major Bible characters and sorted it into those who  seemed to have a positive/holy assessment in the Judeo-Christian  tradition, versus those who tend to be seen as villains, versus those  for whom the assessment is mixed or neutral or ""meh"" or where tradition  has sort of ignored them.

The ones  with asterixes are present in either the 2004 or 1961 Roman Martyrology. Others have feasts on Eastern calendars, or are mentioned as saints in traditional prayers, or are praised as godly in the Biblical text  itself (including later in the New Testament), or are spoken of as  venerable by the Fathers, or are treated as good/positive symbols in  typological uses, or who just in general seemed to warrant inclusion based on  their reputation and character.

Orthodox understanding of prayer?,yack_,1601580284,"Hi im a protestant who is very interested in Orthodoxy

I am confused about prayer though, i hear a lot from fellow protestants that Orthos pray to the saints and Mary, but i keep hearing mixed opinions, i have heard on one hand that Orthos don't pray to mary and the saints but rather ask them to pray for certain things (as in James 5:16) and on the other hand i hear that Orthos do pray to the saints and Mary but 'prayer' only means to ask someone of something

maybe both of these are true? I would really appreciate an answer, God bless",OrthodoxChristianity
How do Eastern Orthodox Christian view Western Saints?,StMartinSeminarian,1601580277,"Catholic deacon here, French. My question aims at being non divisive, I hope, as I am wondering in good faith. The Latin Church celebrates today the feast of St Theresa of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face, who happen to be born in my diocese, and I was thinking, what would be the Orthodox view on her, and on countless Western saints who lived after the separation of 1053? We can name so many of them who not only had a saintly life but also whose written work inspired generations of Christians in their path toward holiness. St Theresa of the Child Jesus is still today one of the most read Christian authors. Do you think they are specifically Latin and just ignore them; or is there something worth in them and their writings in your view? I mean, when I read my breviary, there are many Eastern authors present in it: St Chrysostome is the second biggest purveyor of Lessons at the Office of Reading after St Augustine of Hippo. We read also in the official liturgy of the Latin Church plenty of St Basile, St Gregory of Nazianza and so on. We Western read also for spiritual guidance many Eastern authors, including many who have lived after 1053. Does the other way around exist?

Why be EO over RC?,EmptyPudding777,1601575341,"So I'm currently a Lutheran, leaning strongly Catholic in some areas (faith+works, 7 sacraments, episcopacy), but disagreeing strongly in many (primacy of the Pope, purgatory, Marian devotion, the Magesterium, etc.). So I have definitely looked into Orthodoxy in the past (though at times where I was especially more Lutheran), and I was wondering why be Orthodox over Catholic? 

Because my church descends from the RCC, I find myself quite okay with alot of their atonement beliefs, like the penal substitution atonement theory, original sin, etc., but I'm not quite familiar with Orthodoxy or it's atonement theory, because it seems the prevailing theme is overtly ""Christus Victor"", even though from what I see, the Bible says that Christ took God's wrath for us
Another thing is that there is no such thing as original sin (inherited guilt) in Orthodoxy, and only that our wills are damaged, which is, imo, contrary to scripture which says we are all dead in our sins, and conceived in it. 

Another big issue is heaven and hell. It seems the Orthodox believe hell is a ""state a conscience"" or something along those lines, that hell isn't actual fire, but a tormented conscience's reaction to being in the presence the love of God. This seems contrary once again to scripture, that says hell is separation from God (""Depart from me"").

I'm not trying to bash or disprove Orthodoxy, but these are some major issues I have that I hope can be cleared up, the only other option is Catholicism, which again, I strongly disagree with concerning Purgatory, Marian devotion, the Papacy, etc., and I feel only Orthodoxy has kept doctrinal purity throughout the ages.",OrthodoxChristianity

New To Orthodoxy,eatsleeplyft,1601524670,"So I have been attending the Serbian Orthodox Church for about 2 months and attending regularly. I was baptized Catholic but strayed away after many years of terrible priests. I was led into Orthodoxy by reading a lot of Rene Guenon, which led me to Schuon and then Fr. Seraphim Rose. I finally took the leap to join after seeing a video about the 21 Martyrs of Libya, I know Copts aren’t in communion but I was extremely moved by their faith and love of Christ, I decided to go to my local parish. 

That’s my background with orthodoxy, what I’m curious about is how does the Catechism process work. The priest told me that he doesn’t require classes, just to participate. Is this normal? Or do I need to be accepted as a catechumen? What’s the normal length of time one spends as a catechumen? Not that it matters to me, it’s more so because my mom and two of my Orthobro’s want to be there for my Christmation. 

Otherwise I’m currently listening to the Catechetical Lectures by St. Cyril of Jerusalem, which is extremely helpful. I’ve set up a small prayer and icon corner as well.

**Trigger Warning** post discusses depression and suicide,BazDim2,1601440497,"Hello all,

This is going to be a bit of a weird post for me, so bear with me.

I’ve lived with severe depression for almost my whole life. I know what the “sources” are, so that’s not my problem. And yes, I’ve spoken with therapists and doctors, and other healthcare professionals, and have tried a variety of therapies and medicines. I’ve been through the mental health machine a few times. I’ve not found that any particular remedy or therapy has been particularly helpful for me (I am not encouraging anyone to not seek those methods of help if they so need, just that they weren’t for me specifically).

I’m almost 30 now, and I’ve learnt a lot since my teen years about mental and emotional techniques, and about self-control and emotional maturity. I’ve come a long way to be sure, but it’s still a daily struggle, and some days it’s worse than others, and I’ve had a few crises points in my life.

Since the pandemic started, my mental health has been precarious at best. I’ve lost family recently, as well as my job. I increasingly feel as though my control over my emotions is slipping, and there have been times I’ve depersonalized just due to the stress.

A few days ago, I had a severe crisis point, the worst I’ve had in a couple of years. I deleted my social media including Reddit, made my bed, and was ready to walk out into the woods and just lie down and die. Before I did I wanted to pray at my icon corner one last time. I did so, and found myself prayer there for hours, uttering the Jesus Prayer for maybe an hour in addition. When I opened my eyes, the day was basically gone, and so was the pain. I lived one more day. I won, for one more day.

I think I’m doing okay now, and the worst of it has passed. I don’t really know why I’m writing this. I actually wrote this all out and posted before but then deleted it right away. I have a strained relationship with my parents and basically no friends or social network. I have a fiancée, and she’s wonderful and loving, but I’m ashamed to always lean on her as she has her own issues and she’s supposed to be my partner, not my caregiver, and I’m afraid that she may be starting to resent me by having to play both roles. I wish I was stronger for her.

Anyways, I wanted to tell you all because during the past few months that I’ve been subscribed here, I’ve felt more community in this group of anonymous strangers than I’ve felt anywhere in offline life. I thought I’d share my insignificant little story about how prayer and Christ got me through one more day, and how it continues to do so every day. I don’t know, maybe it’ll help someone who reads this dealing with something similar.",OrthodoxChristianity

Thoughts on the NRSV Bible translation?,AbhorrentIngestion,1601426729,"I'm currently at university studying Philosophy, Religion &amp; Ethics and one of the modules I'm taking this semester is called 'The Good Books: Intertextual Approaches to Literature and the Bible'. In this module, we find ways to integrate biblical studies and literary studies so that we can analyse biblical tropes in TV, film, music, etc.

Anyway, the Bible translation we've been set is the NRSV translation, which I understand to be an ecumenical translation. I've only had time to superficially read it (it only arrived in the mail for me yesterday), but I already find it far superior to my NIV Bible, both in terms of the translation (I find the NRSV far more interesting to read, the NIV can be quite dry in places) and in the canon included - in the NIV, it only included the Protestant canon, but the NRSV I've got includes the Apocrypha and books covering the Orthodox canons too. 

Well, it's got all of the books of the Orthodox canon apart from the Ethiopic books which belong solely in the Orthodox Tewahedo canon, but I'm not too upset about that as I can find them online if I feel the need to reference them at any point.

I've been told that a lot of Orthodox Christians quite like the NRSV translation, but I wonder why it is that you actually enjoy it? That's, of course, assuming that those of you who read this actually like the translation. If you don't, I'd be interested to know your thoughts regardless. From what I've gathered, the NRSV is quite a liberal translation (at least in comparison to the KJV), so I find it interesting that many Orthodox Christians actually favour it.

What are your overall thoughts on the NRSV Bible translation? Do you think it's the best one, do you think it's too liberal, do you think it could be improved?",OrthodoxChristianity

Both the title of this post, and the above quotation from Hieromonk Damascene's book, *Christ the Eternal Tao*, are a distillation of how I have come to understand those sins which are as St. Paul describes ""A thorn in the flesh"" especially since there are many on the sub who have been wondering about confession and sin and all these other heavy topics because they are close to being illumined. I hope this helps.

The title is a quotation from the English Mystic: Julian of Norwich, and as I was reading *CET* I couldn't help but notice a thematic similarity between them. We often think of our sin as purely evil, a total departure from the goodness and beauty of God, which I will not deny. However, I think there is an aspect of sin that we often miss, or perhaps misunderstand. In sinning, we are afforded the chance of repentance and to receive the grace of God. More so, if understood at it's deepest level we can come to a greater understanding of our true selves. We are reminded in this that ""The kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force"", and that moreover, ""The Kingdom of God is within you."" In the pain, in the suffering, we are being purified from the far more damaging element to our spiritual communion with God: our ego. We, whether we will it or not, imagine ourselves as being rather holy, whether it be because of our prayer rule, or confession schedule, or number of services we go to, or the protests we attend, or the soup kitchens we serve at. 

When we sin, we lament our sins, but often not even for the right reasons. Typically (and I would say almost always) we don't lament our sins due to their departure from our ""pristine simplicity"" as Hieromonk Damascene puts it. Rather, we lament our sins because in them we see that we failed to live up to the holy expectations we had for ourselves. Expectations of being chaste, or generous, or self-controlled. I have stifled the words ""You're better than this"" into my pillow in between bouts of tears more times than I care to admit. And yet, in God's mercy and grace, I have recently heard him say:

No you're not better than this. 

Yet, I love you still.

For my strength is made perfect in weakness.

We aren't better than our sin, in fact, it is the most obvious thing we could do, obvious to God of course, but not to ourselves. The grace of the fall is that we can come to terms with our fallenness. But only then do we then begin the journey of true inner repentance. We have to come to terms with our weakness. We must learn to be soft and yielding to grace by emptying ourselves of the self-love and ego that gets us there to begin with. There is no formula. There is no equation. There is nothing you do for the healing to happen. You just have to get out of the way, and allow the Holy Spirit, God who dwells in you, to allow his work and will to be done.",OrthodoxChristianity

**Trigger Warning** - this post discusses depression and suicidal thoughts,BazDim2,1601411898,"Hello all,

I’ve struggled with severe depression since early childhood. I know what’s caused it, that’s not the issue. Yes, I have spoken with doctors and other health care professionals. Yes, I have tried various medications and therapies. Therapy is minimally effective and medication does not work for me very well (I want to stress “for me”, I’m not encouraging people to not pursue medical therapies if that’s what you need). I’ve developed many strategies and techniques to arrest my thoughts from spiralling, and I’ve grown a lot in my emotional and mental control, but still I sometimes reach crises points. I’m 30 now and a lot better than I used to be when I was a teen, but it’s still a constant battle with an enemy I feel is right beneath the surface.

Prior to the pandemic, my last crisis (ideations of self-harm) was a year ago. Since the start of the pandemic however I’ve faced numerous emotional and financial hardships and I feel like my mental health is teetering on the brink.

A few days ago I deleted all my social media and was ready to walk into the woods. I suppressed my thoughts with a constant Jesus Prayer, thank God, and managed to come back from that. But the frequency and magnitude is higher, and I’m coming too close to comfort.

I increasingly feel like I am not in control of my thoughts and emotional state. I have no social network at all, essentially, besides my fiancée, who oscillates between absolutely loving me and secretly resenting me for burdening her with my enormous emotional and mental baggage. She deserves to feel like my partner and not my caregiver, after all. These past months as I’ve been posting here, I’ve come to realize that this group of anonymous strangers, who are only brought together by a shared faith, is the only real community I have. This may be an immensely unfair burden to ask of you, and possibly totally selfish, but I’m wondering if this wretched sinner could ask for some advice and/or words of encouragement?

"Divine and Creaturely Wisdom, Sergei Bulgakov.",LuisDeCamoes,1601408503,"Whether we consider Sophia as the aforementioned Theologian would, or as the Logos, either way, this citation unveils the full dignity and beauty of the cosmos. 

&gt;“One and the same Sophia is revealed in God and in creation. Therefore, if the negative definition, ‘God created the world out of nothing’ eliminates the idea of any nondivine or extradivine principle in creation, its positive content can only be such that God created the world out of himself, out of His essence. And the idea that the content of world was invented ad hoc by God at the creation of the world must be fundamentally rejected. The positive content of the world’s being is just as divine as its foundation in God, for there is no other principle for it. But that which exists pre-eternally in God, in His self-revelation, exists in the world only in becoming, as becoming divinity. And metaphysically the creation of the world consists in the fact that God established His proper divine world not as an eternally existing world but as a becoming world. In this sense, He mixed it with nothing, immersing it in becoming as another form of being of one and the same divine world. And this divine world is the foundation, content, entelechy, and meaning of the creaturely world. The Divine Sophia became also the creaturely Sophia.

A sponsor,THE-GRIMR3P3R11,1601363040,"Hello,

I recently made a post asking about the process of being baptised into orthodoxy.

I was told that when approaching baptism I’ll need a sponsor and was told a sponsor is normally someone you choose within the church.

I also was told they become a godmother or father and also because a resource that help you supply stuff for your baptism.

I was wondering if a sponsor is mandatory? I myself and not very good at being social because of my disability. I also tend to be extremely shy to new people and I probably would have extreme trouble asking someone I don’t know to be my sponsor.

I'm an Orthodox Christian who has fallen away from his faith. I have been struggling to find faith again but there are several theological and ethical questions I struggle with that have made it difficult. That's a different conversation though.

1. We are getting civilly married. I understand the church doesn't recognize civil marriage as sacramental and thus aren't 'valid marriages' in the Orthodox understanding. Is there a way to get the marriage 'sacramentalized' should we return to full faith (which I'm trying to work on)? What if she returns to faith but wants to remain Catholic?

Taking communion during the pandemic,iridescent_skiess,1601263770,"Now, I know this is going to be a controversial topic, but here are my thoughts. For background, I was baptized Orthodox as an infant. I also currently have Covid-19. 

For the parishes that aren't being careful with sanitizing the holy spoon after every person, why is that? I know that the spoon is supposed to be holy, but we have a deadly virus going around if you didn't know, and with the winter coming, I don't expect less people to be catching it. There are probably lots of people going to church in person, taking communion right now and not know that they have the virus. 

I would like someone to explain to me the concept of everyone eating from the spoon and not getting anyone sick, I know that it's a holy spoon but we have to think of science here, too. The only time I got communion during the pandemic was in July, and the priest told me to close my lips on the spoon and take everything. I felt so disgusted because I thought about all the other people who have eaten from that spoon, who may have had the virus at the time and didn't know. Thankfully, I didn't get infected then. But now that I have tested positive, I was thinking about the fact that if I had gone to church two weeks ago, I probably would have spread the virus to many people through taking communion. 

Lastly, for those who say that the spoon is holy and won't transmit the virus, then why wouldn't those who are sick be able to eat directly from the spoon? why is there a different protocol for the sick to receive communion? I read an NPR article that stated some words from an infectious disease specialist from Johns Hopkins, saying that the alcohol content in the Eucharist isn't enough to kill the virus.

Update: Attending Divine Liturgy (first time) with Evangelical Mother,anony22330,1601243236,"Hi guys,

A few days ago I posted that my evangelical mom had offered to drive me to Divine Liturgy, though she is concerned about my interest in Orthodoxy. Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/iz6j1k/attending_divine_liturgy_first_time_with/). I want to say I really appreciated the encouraging responses.

We went today, and it was very nice to finally go. It's a Greek Orthodox church so some parts were in Greek, though most was in English. I thought the service was beautiful, though it's extremely different from what I'm used to (I've only been to a liturgical service once before, when I went to a Catholic mass on a field trip in college, 10 years ago). I didn't get a chance to speak to the priest after the service, since I had the feeling my mom wanted to leave.

Frankly my mom's concerns weren't alleviated by the service. She said she thinks all the rituals are ""man's religion"" steeping in. She also had a hard time understanding the liturgy (maybe I should have prepared her better, though I doubt it would have done much good). On the way home, she brought up that she had read on the church's website that they consider tradition as authoritative as the Bible, and that ""isn't scriptural."" I told her that I don't see where it says in the Bible that it's the *only* authority, and that tradition would have been needed before the Bible was written. We sort of wound up debating this, but only ended up talking past each other. My mom thinks that I don't need ""man's interpretation"" at all, she argued that there's one interpretation and others are wrong. I tried to make the point that *everyone* is convinced that they are right and others are wrong, so what do if I'm convinced that a pastor is interpreting the Bible wrong? Should I assume I'm correct and he isn't? But she really didn't seem to understand this point.

She brought up John 6 again and argued that taking it literal is out of context. We again debated this, and I'll admit I probably got too defensive. I know I should avoid debate, but it gets a bit difficult when my mom keeps trying to convince me to change my opinion of John 6 (after I argued back, she then said she wasn't trying to say that I'm wrong, but she did say previously that a literal reading was out of context). She had sent me a video of a John MacArthur sermon on John 6 two nights ago and brought that up again. It just seems so obvious to her that John 6 is metaphorical, and she doesn't understand how I can read it literally. To me, the more literal reading just seems straightforward (but I also take it in context of the Church Fathers), though I'm not trying to convince *her* of that (she will rarely change her mind on anything).

After she realized I was defensive she dropped the argument. I'm going to try my best to avoid it in the future. I was hoping she wouldn't react the way I feared she would. I know she wants what's best for me, but it's hard to explain to her my point of view because she just doesn't understand why I would want to be a part of the Orthodox church at all. To her, it's just obviously fake man-made ritual. I want to try and be open to the possibility I might be wrong (though I know people on here don't think I am). But it's frustrating for it to be a one way street. My mom won't even consider the possibility that she's the one who's wrong. I hope at least she won't bring up the topic again for awhile.",OrthodoxChristianity

Are there any scholarly defenses of apostolic succession from the Orthodox perspective?,MarysDowry,1601228107,"I am trying to look deeper into the issue of apostolic succession, but most the popular resources I've seen so far are quite surface level and superficial, not digging into the sources with a critical lens.

Basically I am looking for defenses of apostolic succession which get into the nitty gritty of the sources and answers the complicated questions, some examples of the kind of things I am looking into:

The situation in 1 Clement where there does not seem to be a single bishop, but a council of bishops + conflicting lists of apostolic succession of Rome

The issue of whether Paul/Peter were ever in Rome, for example Pauls lack of any such greeting to Peter when in contact with the Romans.

Papias reference to multiple Johns, one which seems to be past tense and one who seems to be present tense.

""If, then, any one who had attended on the elders came, I asked minutely after their sayings – what Andrew or Peter said, or **what was said** by Philip, or by Thomas, or by James, or **by John**, or by Matthew, or by any other of the Lord's disciples, [and] which things Aristion and the **presbyter John, the disciples of the Lord, say**. For I imagined that what was to be got from books was not so profitable to me as what came from the living and abiding voice.""

Papias alleged account of Johns martyrdom too.

On the papias point, I am interested in the potential problems of later apostolic links where Irenaeus refers to Papias as a companion of Polycarp and a hearer of John.

Would Papias need to ask of the apostle Johns teachings from witnesses if he had been a hearer of John himself? Eusebius tells us that Papias didn't meet any of the apostles, citing his lost writings.

""Thus Irenaeus. But Papias himself, in the preface of his work, makes it clear that he himself neither heard nor saw in person any of the holy apostles""

Now some have argued that Eusebius douted the connection because of Papias's chiliast eschatology (which Papias supposedly recounts as an unrecorded saying of Christ to support), perhaps? It would be quite odd if Papias had direct contact with John, but held to an eschatology that was completely wrong. 

Papias believed that:

“that there will be a millennium after the resurrection of the dead, when the kingdom of Christ will be set up in material form on this earth”

https://blog.tms.edu/early_witness_to_premillennialism

The article poses an interesting question I also have here:

""Is it likely that these two men were simply wrong about the millennium? Is it probable that they misunderstand John? We think not. It is more likely that they held to premillennialism because John himself taught this view.""

From my perspective, if we reject millenialism (as most Orthodox think we do) we are accepting that a very early (possibly direct from the apostles) tradition among even the Bishops was wildly inaccurate within a generation. If we want to rely on the tradition of the church, what should we make of such early corruption of tradition? 

Papias cites his direct interactions with the witnesses to the apostles, was a very early Bishop (so he was well placed to gather information), met with Polycarp and even cites unwritten words of Christ. If Papias was so easily misled by false testimony (which he claims to be from actual witnesses) why should we place any trust in the veracity of this apostolic lineage?

Irenaeus fell into this same 'error' too. Perhaps taking it from Papias. You may see my point here, that one supposedly incorrect tradition very early on can easily corrupt the stream of teaching. Why do we think we know better than Papias, Polycarp and Irenaeus about what John taught in Revelation?

"Let us pray for the Oriental Orthodox in Armenia, who are facing war with Azerbaijan and Turkey",TwoSquareClocks,1601205714,"This seems to be the first post on the topic.

As of today the Azerbaijani military has resumed the decades-old frozen conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian disputed territory within Azerbaijan's borders. Armenia is mobilizing its military in support, Turkey has pledged to support the Azerbaijanis in any necessary manner, and Russian supply planes are flying into Armenia. Given the Azeri rhetoric over the past two decades, the Armenians face another ethnic cleansing should they be defeated in this war.

How to respond to anti theists about communion,Lord_Have_Mercy123,1601094590,"Ive been meaning to post this for awhile...

So I’ll be frank. I don’t think Holy Communion can transmit infection. While I understand the fear many people have, I cannot bring myself to be afraid. I do not have fear in my heart over it. I really don’t. I don’t believe the sacrament can transmit infection, from the common cold to Covid 19.

Now, with that said I am not some sort of fundementalist. We should obey the governing authorities, wear masks because they work (unpopular opinion somehow?) and take other precautions.

The problem is, I want to work in STEM. I am seventeen, in my last year of high school and am going to study STEM and work in STEM hopefully. This opinion will be ostracized as anti science and anti theists will point their fingers at it as proof of the fact that “faith” is not merely flawed epistemology (in their view) but demonstrably harmful, and I can’t respond because the answer literally is just have faith!

Questions about Orthodoxy,goldlikeglass,1601073090,"Hello brothers and sisters in faith, 
I recently visited a orthodox service last Sunday and had a few questions. Please excuse my ignorance as my Christian experience is heavily Protestant. I do hunger for something more, something deeper. 

Q1. I noticed every time certain things were mentioned(like the Trinity), the congregants would do the Father, Son and Holy Spirit hand thing. Some would touch the ground before they did it. What is this about? Why do they do it every time the Trinity is mentioned? To me(Protestant) it seems like vain tradition. Any insight would be appreciated.

Q2. Why do the Priest wear such decorative cloths? They look hella cool but I don’t understand what it symbolizes. Also why do they hang out in the Holie of Holies looking room, behind the pulpit? What does that symbolize? What do they do back there? 

Q3. Why do they sing their scripture? I actually love that they do it, but why? 

Q4. Are there any dietary restrictions (like Kosher)? 

Q5. How does Salvation work in the Orthodox tradition? 

Q6. How do Orthodox feel/ think about other denominations?",OrthodoxChristianity
"Regarding Orthodoxy, Puritan Aesthetics, and Vestments",exodusthrowaway777,1601073034,"To what extent is Orthodoxy compatible with Puritan aesthetics?

An odd question. I am looking at coming from the RC, in part, on account of an observed lack of diversity as a ""bad fruit"" of the papacy. Part of me feels that the development of the papacy has ultimately restricted the faith to a distinctly western European Christian spirituality. Gone, is the Byzantine spirituality, the Celtic spirituality, and so on.

In short, the universality of Orthodoxy does not imply homogeneity, in regards to expression. 

And practically, I see an interpretation of American Christianity as Puritan in its rejection of embellishment. I agree that vestments and churches are to be beautiful. And I do not speak of iconoclasm. But must we pay honor to the divine mystery solely in a baroque manner within Orthodox Christianity? Can Orthodoxy envision a classical, tasteful, but simplistic, American spirituality one day?

For further clarity, I've included two examples.

Attending Divine Liturgy (first time) with Evangelical Mother,anony22330,1600983778,"I've been ""Orthocurious"" for months now, and because of extra time on my hands (working from home job with few hours, Covid, etc) I've done a lot of reading and research into Orthodoxy and the early church, and have been wanting to attend Orthodox services before making a decision to convert or not (obviously I don't want to take that decision lightly). But I haven't actually been to a service yet, because the closest church to me requires a drive on a busy highway I've rarely driven on and I can get a lot of anxiety while driving, and Covid is another concern. 

About a month ago, I wound up telling my mom (her and my dad are both very serious evangelicals) that I'm interested in Orthodoxy. I wasn't necessarily planning on telling them then, but I had told my mom months before I wanted to go to a different church (I didn't specify which one or why) and she had been constantly asking if I'd found another church yet and I got sick of always evading the subject. She didn't react badly (as she didn't know all that much about Orthodoxy) though she didn't really understand why. I explained that I'd come to believe in the Real Presence (partly due to John 6) and baptismal regeneration. 

About a week ago, she invited me over to have dinner and talk about it some more. This time, we debated a bit (though respectfully). My mom offered an alternative interpretation of John 6 she had read but I didn't find it convincing. We argued about stuff like priests, prayers/petitions to saints, sola scriptura, etc. My mom doesn't consider Catholicism to be a legitimate form of Christianity because they ""add things"" to the Bible according to her (and the Orthodox have many similarities). She's also concerned that I'm leaving an authentic ""biblical Christianity"" for ""cold liturgical religion."" 

Like I said, even though we argued she was still pretty respectful, though she has sent me a few texts of evangelical arguments against the Real Presence. She then called a few days ago and after some conversation she offered to drive with me to the nearest Orthodox church this Sunday. I was pretty surprised at the offer, given the above, but maybe she's hoping I won't like the service and drop the whole thing. 

I did email the church and let them know we're planning to visit, but haven't received a response back. This was only a few days ago but I'm not sure if we should just show up if I don't get a response by Sunday. I'm hoping my mom visiting the church will help her feel better about it, but it may also have the opposite effect (given all the iconography, etc). I'm 28 and live on my own so she can't really tell me what to do but at the same time I understand she's concerned for my soul (I'll note both of my two sisters have left Christianity altogether, I'm the only one that stayed Christian, and it's caused my mom a lot of grief). I'm hoping this visit will go well, but I'm a little worried about it especially if the priest doesn't email back.

The Prophet by Aleksandr Pushkin,adogsheart,1600979133,"Longing for spiritual springs,


I dragged myself through desert sands ...


An angel with three pairs of wings


Arrived to me at cross of lands;


With fingers so light and slim


He touched my eyes as in a dream:


And opened my prophetic eyes


Like eyes of eagle in surprise.



He touched my ears in movement, single, 


And they were filled with noise and jingle: 


I heard a shuddering of heavens,


And angels' flight on azure heights


And creatures' crawl in long sea nights, 


And rustle of vines in distant valleys.


And he bent down to my chin,


And he tore off my tongue of sin,


In cheat and idle talks aroused,


And with his hand in bloody specks


He put the sting of wizard snakes


Into my deadly stoned mouth.


With his sharp sword he cleaved my breast,


And plucked my quivering heart out,


And coals flamed with God's behest,


Into my gaping breast were ground.



Like dead I lay on desert sands,


And listened to the God's commands: 


'Arise, O prophet, hark and see,


Be filled with utter My demands,


And, going over Land and Sea,


Burn with your Word the humane hearts.'",OrthodoxChristianity

The Necessity of Creation?,Kiprman,1600897065,"Hi all,

I have been reading Sergius Bulgakov's The Lamb of God, and I am inspired by his reflection on the necessity of creation given Divine Love.(Chapter 2.1)   Essentially he believe that creation could not have failed to exist because that would make God limited in love; his love would be reduced to self-love making it not infinite in expression and such.

For any of you who have read Bulgakov, how does he incorporate the Trinity into this?  Isn't the Trinity what makes Gods love perfect and complete, rather than creation?

Admittedly I haven't read the entire book yet, so if he does answer this question I apologize.  I am jumping the gun.  But I am fascinated by this thought.",OrthodoxChristianity

Starting Out,FreeKhajiit,1600888132,"Hi y'all!

I've started my first day of fasting. Skipped breakfast as I normally do, except for a black coffee, (usually drown it in creamer) and had a pretty good amount of veggies for lunch- green beans, tomato and zucchini dhal, rice with gravy and some veg soup. It's very.....well it's definitely devotional. I love food of all kinds, so it's hard to limit my options like that. And working at one of the few dining areas still open, where I get all the free food I want and it's usually pretty good.....yeah. It's going to be a struggle.

Nevermind that my family is not at all understanding of me being Orthodox, (not hostile per se, but more like, ""We don't get it.""). If I told them I started fasting I'd probably get laughed out of the room, and virtually none of the food at my house matches up with the fasting diet. 

I'm doing it to try to learn better impulse control, and also to shed some weight. I definitely would benefit from both of those. How much leeway do I have with the fasting calendar, though?

A lot of the categories seem.....arbitrary in today's world. Like no oil or wine. No seafood or dairy. Ok, easy enough I guess. I don't drink wine, and probably won't miss olive oil that much, when push comes to shove. I drink a lot worse, though. A lot. That's what I need to work on. Can I just interpret the no wine to mean no alcohol/drinking in general? Because I can already see myself using that specific clause as a cop out. Where I say something like, ""Oh it's vodka, not wine! It doesn't count!""  

Does that also mean I can't cook with any beer/wine products, (i.e. like in spaghetti or soup or such), where it cooks off the alcohol but adds flavor? 

I also have a major sweet tooth, and eat way too much candy, soda, and sweets. Again, could I just pick a category, (i.e. no dairy) and use that to mean also no sugar? 

Same with no oil. I don't eat salads with olive oil. I find that kind of gross, actually. I will gladly drown them in ranch or blue cheese, though. Same thing with other foods and gravy, barbeque sauce, hot sauce, etc. I guess you could argue that all of those are sorta kinda oils, and should fall under that limit.

Where do soups, curries, and whatnot stand with that regard?  

I also want to learn how to make a Komboskoini (a prayer rope, I'm sure other denominations call it something different). What materials do I need, about what lengths/dimensions, and where's the best place to find them at a reasonable price? 

Anyways, thanks for coming to my TED Talk.",OrthodoxChristianity

"I am a sad, broken man [UPDATE]",NocturnalPatrolAlpha,1600864920,"It's been a little over two weeks since my [original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/in77xa/i_am_a_sad_broken_man_please_help_me_how_can_i/), and while the things of which I am fearful are still a factor, I have calmed down significantly.

I have restructured my prayer rule so as to make it easier to keep, and I've been praying in the mornings and evenings as faithfully as I can. I've also been going to church as often as possible. Even just being inside the building has a tremendously therapeutic effect on me, as there is a faint lingering scent of incense permeating almost the whole interior.

On the evening of 15th of September, we had mass for the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary. For a second time, during a liturgy centered around Our Lady, I felt her presence in the room with us. Her sorrows became my own. It was so profound I couldn't even cry. Then something happened that made me almost jump. We're talking the next best thing to a Marian apparition. I was reading along with the gospel lesson in the bulletin, and when it concluded I looked back up toward the altar, and the icon of Mary was literally bathed in light. It took me a brief moment to realize it was light from the setting sun shining in from the window at the west end of the nave. Now what are the odds of *that*? The timing and weather conditions, not to mention the exact longitude and latitude of the building itself, are all just right so as for the sunlight to shine through that particular window, to illuminate that particular icon, *during mass on a Marian feast day.* I *know* that was *no* coincidence.

As I said, the things that worry me are still out there, and I have little doubt that the political tensions in my country have passed the point of no return and that things will get much much worse, but for the moment I am calm. I've been getting to know Our Mother for the past year, and I believe she has reached out to me in my time of trouble - on two occasions now - to let me know ""We are here. And we are not going anywhere.""

Thoughts on Marriage with Orthodox from a Different Nation and the Upbringing of Children,Listen-Morty,1600851640,"Hey all, just looking to hear some of your perspectives. I strongly identify as Greek, it is a huge part of who I am as both my parents are Greek and I was raised in Greece. I met a very beautiful, smart, and most importantly, virtuous and good Romanian girl who I love. I want to marry her and we have 99% the same outlook on the important things like faith, values, life, politics, etc. However, despite all the things we have in common I find myself thinking that perhaps our potential kids may struggle to identify with the Greek culture because I understand mothers have a huge influence on the kids and she isnt Greek and doesnt speak it. I know in Heaven there is neither Greek nor Jew but my ethnicity is a huge part of my identity and something I feel very blessed for. I would want to pass that blessing down to my kids but am afraid I wont succeed in that without a Greek wife. I also understand that this could be a huge gamble because why would it matter if the wife is Greek if she is not in line with Orthodox values, virtues etc. which are what is truly important. Ive talked about this with people who are close to me but I thought asking here I could receive some more opinions worth valueing rather than other subs or more distant people irl. 

So, are you married with someone from a different ethnicity who is also Orthodox? What is your experience? What do you think I should do? What would you do of you were in a similar situation?

I've been undergoing a period of severe depression and anxiety over the past year. I also have severe OCD.

Conversion to Orthodox Christianity,sodapop1956,1600740223,"Hello all,

I am sorry as this will be a little long. My name is Ella and I am considering a conversion to Orthodox Christianity. 

I was raised Roman Catholic, but admittedly I am not practicing. I certainly still believe in God, but I believe I have turned away from Him. 

I did some research on Orthodox Christianity and I attended Divine Liturgy with my friend who is Orthodox. It was a beautiful service. I was in awe at all of the sacred icons all over the church. I admit that it felt great to engage in the service. While there, I was introduced to other members who accepted me and were delighted to hear that I was attending Divine Liturgy the next Sunday. I felt so welcome, and I not once felt like I was out of place.

This was close to 2 years ago, however, as I got sick. My everyday life was affected and I was unable to attend Divine Liturgy. I lost the faith I had gained again. I am honest when I say I am upset that it happened. I recently thought things over and I want to return to attending Divine Liturgy and in the future be baptized into the Orthodox Church. I want to be close to God, as I have never been before. 

I spoke on here with someone named Victor (for the life of me I cannot remember his username.) He was incredibly nice and was giving me guidance on how to strengthen my relationship with God. I had to delete my old Reddit account as I got sick and decided that social media was not the best at the moment. (Victor, if you are reading this, I am deeply sorry. I would be delighted to continue to receive your advice.)

A few displays of him remain, with him possibly being a bull or a winged being. 

This is a problem because if YHWH was originally one of multiple gods of a polytheistic group, what makes him God now? He became the one to be worshipped because the Israelites chose him to represent them. The Old Testament would be based on a pagan god, and this would make Christ futile. 

I love our faith, but it’s hard to believe knowing this faith possibly has pagan, polytheist origins.",OrthodoxChristianity

Jonah,qc013330,1600631222,"Hello friends,

I’m in the process of converting from a Southern Baptist background. I ran into a discussion on Reddit that brought up a question for me.

The discussion essentially said that the Book of Jonah was known to be some type of satirical book in ancient times, and groups like Southern Baptist fundamentalists are the only ones who think the events described in it actually happened.

Now, I’ve never heard any professing Christian say that, but then again, I was raised in the group the OP said believed that so maybe I haven’t been exposed to anything else.

So, my question is , does The Church believe Jonah to be a symbolic example, or real recorded events?",OrthodoxChristianity
Struggling in Rural America,militarymonastic,1600626299,"I’m a military person, converted to the Orthodoxy some time ago when I was getting stationed near major coastal cities and there was always a church nearby. Now I’m on my way back home to the middle of nowhere to live and hopefully try to settle down and make a family, where there are countless evangelical churches and no Orthodox church of any kind within a large radius of travel. I don’t want to move back to a big city, they are full of disgusting people and disgusting culture. I don’t want to reconvert back to evangelicalism, it’s shallow and arrogant at best. I’m anxious that I’m going to be alone, unable to find a wife who accepts my faith, and with no place to confess, take communion, or participate in the joys of church life.

"Is it theologically incorrect to call the Theotokos ""sinless""?",LadyWyllaManderly,1600621179,"I know that Roman Catholics believe that she was 100% sinless, but from what I gather, most Orthodox Christians believe so too (although not in the immaculate conception)

Most things I read seem to suggest that she was sinless. I am pretty sure I've heard orthodox priests say so. I get this impression also due to the prayers and hymns using language like ""immaculate, spotless, most pure, most holy, more honorable than the cherubim, more glorious beyond compare than the seraphim"" etc. I believe all of this.

We all know she was very holy, I don't think that this is up for discussion.

The point:

I have been listening to Search the Scriptures on Ancient Faith and on different occasions, Dr. Constantinou says that she was ""not sinless"", but very holy. She says that its not theologically correct to say she is ""sinless"" as this is only true for Christ.  I get it, but then she also says that she was not a sinner, which is my understanding also. She says that it's a sin, and dangerous to discuss this topic, especially on the internet, as it could lead to theological error. I understand that there is a lot of misinformation on the internet etc, but now I am  a bit confused, so here I am reaching out to the internet. lol.

[Here](https://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/searchthescriptureslive/jesus_cleanses_the_temple) at about -30.00 for full context and  about - 25.00 for more to the point. 

So what's the general consensus? To my recollection, I have never heard anyone else say that the Theotokos was ""not sinless"", and I don't think I've ever heard anyone say she was ""sinful"" of course not.. Can we say she was she sinless? I am just trying to learn true Orthodoxy.

Don't worry, I will also be asking my priest the same question.",OrthodoxChristianity
The Parthenos,MarshmallowSnugglez,1600611801,"The Shroud of Turin has long been of significance to the Church and of interest to me. I have followed coverage of it in the news for years, watching with wonder as it has been gradually vindicated by progressively careful and informed examination of relevant evidence, and am convinced that it does indeed likely depict the Lord and Savior. 

Yes, the point where science (not Science, mind you) and the Faith meet and dance fascinates me. When Ray Downing presented the world with his innovative retrieval and reproduction of that face, I found it breathtaking. That modern technology could prove beneficial to the cultivation of faith -- certainly my own -- in Jesus Christ seemed so astounding. 

There was something else to be gained from the presentation, though, if I have correctly understood the Incarnation. Having no genetic father at all but merely the awesome and life-giving power of the Holy Spirit which in wisdom and wonder procured a Y chromosome, our dear Lord's genome would have consisted entirely of that of the Parthenos. Bringing this further into the school of biology and stating the facts plainly, albeit at the risk of sounding so technical that it might regrettably come across as sacrilegious, His flesh and bones would have necessarily been those of His Mother, but masculinized.

Given that we know what effects a Y chromosome has on a face's appearance, it becomes possible to negate those effects and procure the face of the Parthenos. 

As both a digital artist and a follower of the Faith, I elected to take up the challenge myself. So, using a number of digital programs, I did just that. Here is Downing's production, with all masculine traits removed, depicted as a girl of approximately twelve to thirteen.

I falso have two toddlers 2 &amp; 3 years old. I ended up having my son at 27 weeks because my husband, and my children's father, got mad and lost his temper and grabbed me and body slammed me off our drive porch on our house onto the ground. He repeatedly kicked me from my head, belly, and legs. Hard enough to break 3 ribs, my collar bone, jaw, and almost killed my unborn baby. I blacked out from the pain and woke up  8 days later in a hospital ICU with tubes and casts all over. I was informed they had to go in and take my son during a emergency csection because husband had ruptured the placenta and my baby's heart rate was super low. Anyway my son is a miracle for making it and so am I. I could have died and so could my baby. I am not going to keep rambling and making a super long post. I just wanted you guys to know a back story. My husband told me that day he hurt me that if I ever called the cops again on him that he would KILL me.

"The Roman Catholic Church recently issued a doctrinal decree that placed many laypeople - and priests! - outside that Church. Except for situations of heresy, is anyone aware of a similar situation in Orthodox history?",A_Wellesley,1600379389,"Story [here](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/invalidly-baptized-oklahoma-priest-baptized-and-re-ordained-44890):

&gt; Fr. Zachary Boazman, a priest of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, thought he was validly ordained in 2019. But in August, the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a doctrinal note, reminding Catholics that baptisms are not valid if the minister of the baptism changed the words, or formula, of the baptism from “I baptize you” to “We baptize you.”

&gt; Boazman, who was baptized in another diocese in 1992, reviewed a videotape of his baptism after the announcement from the Vatican and discovered that the deacon ministering his baptism had used the invalid “We baptize you.”

&gt; A Sept. 14 letter sent to priests, deacons and staff of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, and shared with CNA, said Boazman was “immediately contacted Archbishop Paul Coakley to explain the situation and seek guidance” after his discovery.

&gt; Because Boazman’s baptism had not been valid, the subsequent sacraments he received - reconciliation, Holy Communion, confirmation, ordination - were therefore also not valid. His invalid baptism also invalidated many of the sacraments he offered before his valid ordination, including Masses, confessions, and some marriages. A key exception to that are the baptisms ministered by Boazman, as baptisms can be validly performed by anyone using the correct formula (wording) and the right intention.

&gt; Within days of Boazman’s discovery, he was validly baptized Catholic and validly ordained as a priest.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City noted that Coakley sanated, or validated, the marriages witnessed by Boazman prior to his valid ordination last week. Boazman had not celebrated any confirmations prior to his valid ordination.

&gt; [...]

&gt; Boazman is not the only priest to have recently discovered that he was not even a Catholic, let alone a priest.

There don't appear to be any accusations of heresy brought by the Vatican against these unfortunate individuals, and still they've found they've never really been Catholic (and by Roman Catholic hard-liner extension, *Christian*), on a technicality. Or, the sacraments they'd received had never been valid, not because of heresy, anathematization, or schism, just a technicality that these individuals were *not* responsible for.

So, is anyone aware of a similar situation in the Orthodox Church, where a not-insignificant population of the Faithful suddenly found themselves outside of the Church, through no fault of their own? I'd imagine the differences between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic approaches to the concept of ""valid"" make this far less likely.",OrthodoxChristianity

"Questions about ""oaths"" (What should I do in this situation?)",RhinoVI,1600272858,"Apologies if this is an annoying one. I just need some help with discernment. 

Basically, I feel as if I committed a terrible sin the other day, and this morning  guilt and confusion about it hit me so hard that in my heart I had determined in a moment that I would skip breakfast at home and only eat it if it were offered to me (I was tired and out of it, don't ask). However, the words that came out of my mouth  were, ""I will not eat in this house,"" without specifying a timeframe. 

I did try rectifying it immediately after by praying something along the lines of, ""Whoops, I only meant this morning!"" - but is that how it works?

What does this mean (apart from the fact that I am probably insane &amp; overly-scrupulous)? Does it mean I would be breaking an oath to the Lord if I were to eat in my home again? James 5:12 has me pretty worried.

Three members of this band became Orthodox priests (interview),12tonewalrus,1600242125,"[https://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/85-three-fifths-our-band-got-ordained-luxury/](https://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/85-three-fifths-our-band-got-ordained-luxury/)

There are many strange stories in rock history. But Luxury is surely the only band in which three out of five members ended up becoming Orthodox priests.

Combining a hard-edged instrumental texture with sweet, melodious vocals and literary lyrics, Luxury has continued to record and perform sporadically since their beginning in the mid-1990s Christian punk scene. They have retained a loyal following and their latest album, *Trophies*, was released last year to much acclaim.

Fr. David Lee Bozeman—singer, songwriter and guitarist—joins The Catholic Culture Podcast to tell the band’s story, discuss the relationship between liturgy and modern culture, and comment on his lyrics, which deal with themes like ordination, marriage real and counterfeit, the scourge of pornography, and the sanctification of the body.",OrthodoxChristianity

The Wisdom of the Far East,SSPXarecatholic,1600221026,"I have been wanting to make this post for quite some time, but have had trouble finding the right words to express it, but here it is.

Recently I have been trying to grow more charitable and appreciative of God's mercy in preparing people all over the world for the fulness of his revelation in Christ. I see the foreshadowing of Christ's coming and certain Christian elements manifesting themselves in cultures and religions far removed from the ancient near east and from Christian influence, and with that a deep sense of awe that our heavenly Father, in his mercy and goodness, desires that all be drawn to him. While Christianity is characterized by what we refer to as ""the scandal of particularity"" I find that even within the Church itself a great deal of admiration and respect is given to those who helped pave the way for the minds of men to receive the fulness of divine revelation, even outside of the parameters of Israel. 

We see this play out to such a degree that we even have ancient Greek philosophers depicted in iconography in some of our temples such as [this](http://www.omhksea.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/philisophers2meteora.jpg). With this in mind, I wonder why we seem to stop at the wisdom of these and a few others with offering due appreciation to they who prepared the soil of the hearts of Men to receive Christ as their fulfillment? In particular, with regards to the teachings of the Buddha. I have been amazed at how the great bishop and enlightener of Japan, St. Nicholas, spoke about Buddhism. It was from his own lips that the famous line

&gt;\[Buddhism is\] The best of the pagan religions—a herculean pillar of human effort compiled for itself a religion, guided by those obscure remains of God-revealed truths that had been preserved by the races after the Babylonian dispersion.

St. Nicholas spent nearly a decade learning the Japanese language and studying their various systems of belief, in particular Buddhism, seeing Japan as a rich crop of souls ready for harvest into the Masters hands. He, like myself, saw no personal spiritual interest in Buddhism, but found that its study was necessary to better reach the people of Japan.

And yet, with this in mind, why is it then that we give little if any acknowledgment of the work of God in preparing the hearts of those in the far East? St. Nicholas wrote further about Buddhism saying 

&gt;Having arisen on Indian soil as an antidote to the Brahmin caste system and the oppression of the lower classes by the higher, Buddhism was in this respect a preaching of spiritual equality and love in the pagan world; on the other hand, because it is the preaching of a man who was the heir to the throne but became instead a beggar, ***it is the preaching against the vanity of this world, of non-acquisitiveness and poverty.***

It  seems totally clear that this is the way of Christ, the way of the God of our Fathers. A view which informs our own lives as being dust and vanity. One which teaches that true freedom is freedom from our passions, freedom from our worldly attachments with an eye to the Kingdom which is to come, and is indeed already manifested among us.

What then feeds the heart of the Buddhist who is coming to know of Christianity is that only within the Christian religion their philosophies take the shape of a person with whom we can know and enter into relationship with. It seems that when we offer thanks to those who prepared the hearts of Men we seem to overlook and call outright demonic those religions of the far East which came before Christ without giving a closer inspection to that which provides the antidote to what they are often missing. Even within Hinduism, while there are many manifestations of the divine the Smartism sect believes Brahma to be the true deity that is to be worshipped, although fundamentally impersonal and is considered to be a very hard for for practicing the eternal Dharma, but the manifestations of the many gods are ways for us to interact with that higher divinity. 

I suppose before this gets too long, I wonder why in those churches of the far east and even here in the west, Buddha is not regarded as highly as the hellenic philosophers in preparing the way for Christ? By no means am I saying we go full Assisi and erect a statue of Buddha on our altars, heaven forbid, but there seems to be a great deal of resistance in accepting the wisdom and beauty that comes from those sources.",OrthodoxChristianity

Question on Possible Refutations to the Orthodox Church,SenpaiShockflare,1600192841,"I was wondering if any of these statements were legitimate arguments against the Orthodox Church or if they are unfounded and can be ignored?

These statements are not my work, but are from a commentor on YouTube:

1. Catholic Church has Augustinian understanding of Sacraments. Having valid Eucharist does not mean one preaches true Doctrine, but that one preaches true Doctrine about Eucharist. You guys have Cyprianic understanding of Sacraments.. even though Cyprian's understanding was condemned by your own Church.
2. Eastern and Western Rite always had different approaches to the same issue. Just check Alexandrian vs Antiochian Schools in the East. They had very different approaches to things and were united. That is how pre-Schism Church worked. By the way, Palamism as accepted by Eastern Catholics does not refute nor oppose any of Rome's doctrines. What Catholics argue against is extreme interpretation of Palamism that is heretical. That is not present in Eastern Catholicism.
3. Word ""oecumenical"" has two meanings in Greek. One means universal, one means imperial. There were 7 Imperial Councils, and 21 Universal ones in Catholic Church. If you use word ""ecumenical"", you can say there were 7 if you mean imperial and 21 if you mean universal. No one can say that there were 7 universal councils and be in good conscience Catholic.
4. Eastern Catholics do not reject Filioque in a sense that Holy Spirit comes primarily from the Father and secondarily through the Son (as Latin Church teaches), and neither does your Church. What Eastern Catholics do is that they do not include Filioque in the Creed. Armenians had different Creed than all other Churches Pre-Schism. Why would Creeds need to be same in every Church in communion? There is nothing that says that. Second Ecumenical Council of Nicea contains in it's documents profession of faith of Patriarch Tarasios who affirms Filioque. If you do not say Filioque, you are saying that Holy Spirit comes primarily from the Father. If you say it, you are simply adding that He also comes through the Son. They are not contradictory. No one says Holy Spirit comes from ""Father alone"", neither does your Church.
5. Even your Church agreed that Miaphysitism is correct in past century. Venerating someone does not necessarily mean we agree with their views. Again, your Church venerates St. Cyprian BUT you disagree with his views on baptism. Your Church venerates St. Augustine but you disagree with his theology. Same thing. By the way, Nestorius probably recanted his heresy before his death. He submitted to Ecumenical Council. Please study history before you make uninformed claims.
6. St. Photius can be a Saint because he recanted his errors. He reconciled with Patriarch Ignatius. Study history.
7. No Church has St. Mark of Ephesus as Saint in their calendar.

18m Former atheist Canadian thinking about converting.,GeneralWalters421,1600139366,"So recently I’ve kinda realized I’m not actually an atheist. Basically my Dad’s a pretty hardcore atheist and anti-theist whilst my Mum is kinda “spiritual but not religious“. When I was still living with my Mum I was basically a theist as I did believe in some sort of higher power but when I was in middle school my parents divorced and long story short after a lot of back and forth I moved from New Zealand to Canada with my Dad.

While I was living with my Dad I did go to being a full on atheist and even an anti-theist for a while. Yet I still had plenty of habits that I guess would conflict with this. I basically would have a conflict in my mind about not wanting to think certain thoughts (which of course only reinforces them) and would have this phrase “I don’t promise to God anything” after promising something like “I have to do this or I’ll die in x seconds”. I now recognize this as scrupulously which makes sense given I have plenty of ocd like symptoms. Basically it made me question whether I did actually believe in some form of God in the back of my mind this whole time.

I have also always had quite a love for history. Specifically Europe around the early modern period and the middle ages. So much so that I have focused on it in University (18m in my second year). This of course meant I would learn a lot about Christianity and I have quickly become fascinated with it. Around this time I’ve also been interested in political traditionalism which I not only agree with rationally but actually feels right, and that’s it’s building a future I want to live in, (compared to other movements I’ve been in like libertarianism). This political movement brought me into reading a lot of people like G. K. Chesterton, Tolkien and many others who where pretty much all avid Catholics or theists of some sort and it does make me wonder why some of the smartest people I follow and have read all follow this idea that seems so foreign to me.

So this puts me in a odd position. I’m fascinated by Christianity, think I believe in some sort of God, believe that these are traditional teachings that are known to work and bring happiness yet am unsure if I even believe in Christ as the saviour, let alone if I’m willing to follow all church dogma... Yet Christianity feels like the only path I can seriously take since converting to Islam or Buddhism or something seems a bit ridiculous. I just have a really hard time believing that I have finally found the one true faith among millions of others claiming to have done so throughout human history.

So I have been listening to the bible as a audiobook (which if nothing else is fascinating based on the amount of symbolism that connects to history) and have also looked into a few of my local churches. All the various Protestant churches were flying rainbow flags which just shows me they are willing to constantly sway to the winds of contemporary politics and are not something I could get behind. Anglicism only exists because of Henry VIII wanting to divorce his wife so I also have a a hard time taking that seriously. That leaves me with the two main choices being the Catholic and Orthodox churches. I do sorta understand the main differences but most of them other than Papal infallibility (which I can’t say I’d support given I’m no fan of the current Pope) are over my head. I guess my main interest with Orthodoxy over Catholicism is that is far as I am aware, it seems to be the original church with direct lineage to the original apostles and Constantine’s Rome.

So with my life story and theological essay aside... what do you think I should do? I might post something similar to the r/catholic subreddit as well to see a different point of view, but generally I guess I wanna know what I, as someone who isn’t even sure he believes in Jesus Christ as the son of God, (kinda the whole idea of Christianity) can get into the faith, community and possibly even a church...",OrthodoxChristianity

Aerial toll-houses,Orthodox_anglo,1600113319,"This will be an attempt to EXPLAIN this doctrine, because its opponents often try to strawman it into something that it is not. 

What the doctrine teaches is that when you die, angels appear to take your soul to heaven, while demons appear trying to drag your soul to hell. The demons accuse you of your sins as part of this process, while the angels defend you.

This process generally occurs while the angels are trying to help you ascend to heaven, though very holy men ascend almost instantly, with few demons attacking them, while wicked men are simply immediately dragged to hell.

Please note that the demons are not “judging your souls in place of God” in the doctrine, as many people think. God is the only judge and Final Judge.

It’s very clear that the demons merely take the role of a prosecutor, accusing your soul of sins, while the angels are your defender. But in the end, God alone is the impartial judge who decides your salvation.

This is the core of the doctrine. Anything else is merely an attempt to use figurative language to explain this doctrine. There are not literally custom booths in the sky where you have to pay a literal toll to demons to pass. 

Even the tale of Theodora’s journey through the tollhouses, a roughly 10th century text, which is the source from which much of the language of tolls and custom houses is most used, makes it very clear that it is using figurative language to describe what can only be understood spiritually.

Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos, a very highly regarded theologian-bishop in Greece, writes about this far better than I can. 

St. Anthony’s Greek Monastery here in America, under the guidance of Elder Ephraim, former abbot on Mount Athose, recently published a 1,100 page book on the [subject ](https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/nootherfoundation/book-review-departure-soul/)
This book is absolutely filled with citations on the tollhouses from Scripture, Church Fathers, liturgical services, contemporary saints, etc. It was endorsed by numerous bishops and prominent theologians in America including the heads of the Antiochan, Russian, and Romanian Archdioceses of America and the former head of the OCA. I HIGHLY encourage you to read it if you truly want to understand the massive amount of historical support the doctrine has in Orthodoxy.

I cannot hope to provide even 1% of the citations St. Anthony’s provided on this subject, but I’m going to provide at least a few of them below to show that the tollhouses are not some sort of ""gnosticism,” but have instead been a prominent view since ancient times. 

The idea that demons try to seize our souls when we die was present in the early Church. St. Justin Martyr wrote, around 160 AD, of this. [source ](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/01287.htm)

But the very first clear depiction of the journey the soul takes through the air, and the role of the angels and demons in this process, can be found in the “Life of St. Anthony” by St. Athanasius the Great, written in the early 300s. [source ](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2811.htm)
As you can see from this source, St. Anthony and St. Athanasius very clearly taught that the demons try to hinder our ascension into heaven when we die by accusing us of sins. But if we have confessed and repented, we have nothing to fear from them. But if we are sinful, the demons will successfully block our ascension, and drag us into hell.

Here is an example of this belief found in the writings of Saint John Chrysostom (From the late 300s or early 400s). As you can see, Saint John believed that angels would guide our souls to heaven, but the “dreadful powers” of the demons would also try to demand our souls. 
[source ](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chrysostom_four_discourses_02_discourse2.htm)

Likewise, St. Cyril of Alexandria (early 400s) believed that Satan is owed a “debt” by us if we are sinful (hence the “toll” metaphor), and we must pay it off in this life by repenting. [source ](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_09_sermons_89_98.htm)

There is an example of a monk who, even before he died, was confronted by the demons accusing him of his sins. This can be found in the Seventh Step of the Ladder of Divine Ascent an early 7th century text that is the most renowned monastic guide ever written in the history of the Church. 

Here is an explanation of the doctrine found in the famous “Precious Pearl” traditionally thought a work of St. John of Damascus, though some scholars date it to the 11th century. Either way, it’s very old. [source ](https://archive.org/details/stjohndamasceneb00wood/page/199)

There is a tale of a monk who died, saw the process of the soul ascending into heaven and being accused by the demons before being returned to life to tell the living of what happens to the soul after death. The Source is St. Bede’s Ecclesiastical History. [source ](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Bede_s_Ecclesiastical_History_of_England.html?id=OZkAAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

Just as St. Bede, above, wrote of this, so too did St. Boniface, Apostle to the Germans, showing that this doctrine is not unique to the East, but also once existed in the Orthodox West. [source ](https://archive.org/details/cihm_84747/page/n102)

Another Western source on this is the “Life of St. Columba,” a famous 6th century Western Saint. [source ](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/columba-e.asp)

Beyond the Church Fathers and lives of the saints, the doctrine of the tollhouses can be found in many of the liturgical services of the Church, such as one of the versions of the service of Compline. [source ](https://www.goarch.org/-/the-akathist-hymn-and-small-compline)

Probably the service that makes it most explicit is the “Prayer at the Departure of the Soul,” a monastic service performed immediately after a monk dies. [source ](https://archive.org/details/ServiceBookOfHolyOrthodoxChurchByHapgood/page/n397)

Likewise, many contemporary saints firmly believed in the doctrine. Here are quotes from two famous 19th century Russian saints, including the famous quote from St. Theophan the Recluse “No matter how absurd the idea of toll-houses may seem to our ‘wise men’, they will not escape passing through them.”

Likewise, St. John of Shanghai and San Francisco, one of the most famous 20th century Orthodox saints, was an open and ardent proponent of the doctrine (he was the one who taught it to Fr. Seraphim Rose, in fact). [source ](https://orthodox.net/articles/life-after-death-john-maximovitch.html)

St. Paisios, an incredibly famous late 20th century elder of Mt. Athos, also taught the doctrine. [source ](https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/?m=1)",OrthodoxChristianity

Worried whether I accidentally committed a grave sin (NSFW),Nich35142,1600103436,"[Please forgive me if this is NSFW in nature]


Hello, I am currently being crippled with anxiety on whether I committed a horrible sin.

I have had a past of committing self destructive behaviors and I have been clean for a year now, but even sometimes touching my biological parts for their intended purpose creates a insane amount of anxiety of ""What if I just did that (unintentionally) and I felt even the smallest amount of something, therefore I committed this grave sin""

First, some clarification:

- ""Orthodoxy"" is usually meant to refer to those churches that historically separated from Catholicism up to the 11th century. For the sake of clarity, I will use ""Orthodoxy"" here to refer to the Eastern Orthodox Church as it is the biggest and most well known one (but there are others too - the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Assyrian Church of the East, the True Orthodox Church...).

- ""Catholicism"" is usually meant to refer to those churches that regard the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, as the supreme head of the Church. For the sake of clarity, I will use ""Catholicism"" here to refer to the Roman Catholic Church as it is the biggest and most well known one (but there are others too - the Eastern Catholic churches [which are in communion with the Pope but are quite distinct from Roman Catholicism], the Sedevacantists...).

- ""Protestantism"" is usually meant to refer to those churches that find their historical origins in the Reformation of the 16th century. Because Protestants are all over the place and new Protestant denominations are born often, I will only address the principles of Martin Luther and the principles of John Calvin, who together have the most influence on Protestantism overall.

With that out of the way...

Orthodoxy and Catholicism separated in the 11th century; however, it is not until the 15th century that they actually sat down together at a council, the Council of Florence, where they tried to see what exactly was separating them and whether they could come to an agreement. These five issues were highlighted as the big ones:

_________

- **The doctrine of the ""filioque""**: It is an issue of the Trinity. ""Filioque"" means ""and from the Son"". Catholicism says that the Holy Spirit proceeds ""from the Father and the Son"", Orthodoxy says that the Holy Spirit proceeds ""from the Father alone"". 

Let me try to give an explanation: in the Old Testament, the idea is that everything God does, He does through His Word (Logos) and in His Breath (Spirit). So when God does something, it is His Word that carries it out and His Spirit that is His very power doing it. What happens in the New Testament is that the Word becomes incarnate as a person, Jesus of Nazareth, thus revealing itself to be not a mere power or aspect of God or perhaps an angel that obeys God but an actual, divine person, equal to God (the Father) without being the Father and without there being two Gods. So the understanding progresses: everything God (the Father) does is done through His Word (the Son) and in His Spirit (the Holy Spirit). The Father, Son and Holy Spirit are truly encountered as distinct yet not separate person - there is one will and one act of the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit, at any time. The Son becomes incarnate as a man, dies for our sins and rises again to save us from slavery to sin and death and the devil, ascends back to where the Father is, and then He sends His and the Father's Holy Spirit upon the Church to empower it to continue His ministry, forgive sins, spread the gospel, and all that.

But later on in the 4th century some issues arose. People tried to make sense of all this. The Arians in particular, to protect the notion that the Father is almighty, decided to say that the Son is ""homoiousios"" - ""similar in essence"" to the Father. This by itself might not have been an issue, it's just an attempt to make clear that the Son is not the Father. But they concluded as a result that either we worship two gods (the eternal and uncreated Father and the temporal and created Son) or we must stop worshipping the Son, since He is only called ""God"" relatively speaking, in spite of what Christians had always done. In response the Council of Nicea in 325 defined that the Son is ""homoousios"" to the Father, ""of the same essence"", to basically say ""He is as divine as the Father is"". It also said that the Son is ""only-begotten of"" the Father, an expression used in the New Testament many times.

Later in the 4th century, the Pneumatomachians used the same logic as the Arians but toward the Holy Spirit. He must be created, unlike the Father and the Son, especially since God the Father couldn't have begotten both the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Council of Constantinople in 381 also excluded this doctrine, by saying the Holy Spirit ""proceeds from"" the Father, quoting John 15:26, which shows well that the Holy Spirit really does come from within the Father like the Son does, but not in the manner of being begotten but rather of proceeding, whatever that means.

And so the doctrine of the Trinity as we know it was born. The Council of Nicea had satisfactorily showed that the Son comes from within the Father eternally and is truly divine and called God, and the Council of Constantinople satisfactorily showed that the Holy Spirit comes from within the Father eternally without being the Son. The Council of Constantinople also issued the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, which would start being used in worship services (the liturgy) later on. But this didn't really address the ""blind spot"" here: what about the relationship between the Son and the Holy Spirit? In the 5th century, St Augustine of Hippo would say that the Holy Spirit ""proceeds from the Father and the Son"". This was a particular way of saying it, knowing that he used Latin rather than Greek and he wanted to show that if the Son is really God then the Holy Spirit must be really God also. I won't elaborate on what he exactly says and how he could have meant it, but overall the Latin-speaking Western Christians were content with saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds ""from the Father and the Son"" while the (mostly) Greek-speaking Eastern Christians were content with saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds ""from the Father"".

The filioque wasn't heard of in the East much. At one point in the 7th century, some Monothelites (another heresy that I won't get into) from Constantinople attacked the Pope of Rome's orthodoxy because they heard him speak of the Holy Spirit proceeding ""from the Father and the Son"". St Maximus the Confessor defended this expression by saying that the Latin Christians have less precise language than the Greeks and what they mean is simply that the Holy Spirit comes from the Father through Jesus and therefore Jesus and the Holy Spirit are truly of the same essence, but Jesus is not the cause of the Holy Spirit like the Father is. In the late 9th century, the filioque became a major problem: missionaries from the Byzantines and the Franks competed for the territory of Bulgaria, and the Byzantine missionaries realized that the Franks were using the filioque in the creed. Ecumenical Patriarch Photius, Bishop of Constantinople, wrote against this doctrine as he understood it: basically, according to the Greek Church Fathers of the early centuries, in the Trinity there are eternal traits that belong to the essence (such as being God, being almighty, and so on) and eternal traits that belong to the persons (the Son is begotten, the Holy Spirit proceeds, the Father is the cause of the Son and the Holy Spirit). If the Holy Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father and the Son, then being the cause of the Holy Spirit must be an essential trait, as it is shared by the Father and the Son and must therefore be shared by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from Himself too, or must be the cause of a fourth divine person and so on. Or else, it is a personal trait, and so the Father *is* the Son, or worse, the Father *isn't* the Son but they both separately cause their own ""share"" of the Holy Spirit. These are strongly reminiscent of the heresies of Sabellianism (or Modalism) according to which the Father and the Son are one and the same person that just shows up in different forms, and again Pneumatomachianism according to which the Holy Spirit isn't consubstantial with the Father and the Son. Or perhaps outright paganism, if the Father and the Son are both separate causes of the Holy Spirit.

But, church politics were behind the issue (the Byzantines and the Franks competing over who should evangelize Bulgaria, and also Pope Nicolas of Rome claiming the authority to depose Patriarch Photius), and when a council was held in Constantinople to solve the issue, the political problem was solved while the doctrinal one was pretty much swept under the rug.

In 1274, the filioque was given a clear doctrinal definition by the Catholics at the Second Council of Lyons in an attempt to end the schism:

&gt;We profess faithfully and devotedly that the holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son, not as from two principles, but as from one principle; not by two spirations, but by one single spiration. This the holy Roman church, mother and mistress of all the faithful, has till now professed, preached and taught; this she firmly holds, preaches, professes and teaches; this is the unchangeable and true belief of the orthodox fathers and doctors, Latin and Greek alike. But because some, on account of ignorance of the said indisputable truth, have fallen into various errors, we, wishing to close the way to such errors, with the approval of the sacred council, condemn and reprove all who presume to deny that the holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son, or rashly to assert that the holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as from two principles and not as from one.

This didn't work out, mainly because there was no actual Orthodox representation at the council except for a delegation representing the emperor, and the definition was made weeks before they even got there. The emperor accepted the council but the people did not follow. Ecumenical Patriarch John XI was supportive of the Catholic doctrine but also failed to sway many people his way.

In 1439 the Council of Florence, this time with significant Orthodox participation, gave another definition:

&gt;In the name of the holy Trinity, Father, Son and holy Spirit, we define, with the approval of this holy universal council of Florence, that the following truth of faith shall be believed and accepted by all Christians and thus shall all profess it: that the holy Spirit is eternally from the Father and the Son, and has his essence and his subsistent being from the Father together with the Son, and proceeds from both eternally as from one principle and a single spiration. We declare that when holy doctors and fathers say that the holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, this bears the sense that thereby also the Son should be signified, according to the Greeks indeed as cause, and according to the Latins as principle of the subsistence of the holy Spirit, just like the Father. And since the Father gave to his only-begotten Son in begetting him everything the Father has, except to be the Father, so the Son has eternally from the Father, by whom he was eternally begotten, this also, namely that the holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.

But, this still wasn't accepted by the Orthodox, and this was the last attempt to solve this dispute. To Orthodox ears, Catholics seem to teach that the Father and Jesus are basically equivalent. To Catholic ears, Orthodox seem to teach that only the Father is really God, or perhaps that Jesus only serves as the mean by which the Father sends His Spirit.

_______

- **The ""filioque"" in the creed**: As the expression that the Holy Spirit ""proceeds from the Father and the Son"" became extremely popular in the Latin West thanks to St Augustine, it naturally ended up making it into the Latin translation of the creed. No one really knows how that happened, but by the Third Council of Toledo in the 6th century it was included in the creed and nobody in the West batted an eye, thinking it was there all along. This would later become a problem for a very simple reason: the creed was written at an Ecumenical Council, which was considered the highest doctrinal authority, and to purposefully modify it is to say the saints at the council didn't know what they were doing. In the early 9th century, monks in Jerusalem realized that the Frankish monks there weren't using the creed that was originally written at the Council of Constantinople but rather one wih the ""filioque"" in it. This caused great controversy, and the Council of Aachen was held to decide upon the matter, and it decided that the doctrine of the ""filioque"" is so important that it must be in the creed anyway. Pope Leo III (who had the final responsibility of judging on this matter, since he was understood to have jurisdiction in the West and so the Franks were his responsibility) accepted the doctrine of the ""filioque"" but not the addition to the creed and in fact ruled that the creed must be restored back to its ancient form; however the Franks just didn't listen and the issue was forgotten. In the 11th century, the schism between Catholicism and Orthodoxy began when Cardinal Humbert accused the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople of heresy for *not* having the ""filioque"" in the creed, as Rome had finally recognized that form of the creed some 40 years prior. Finally, the Council of Florence ruled that:

&gt;We define also that the explanation of those words ""and from the Son"" was licitly and reasonably added to the creed for the sake of declaring the truth and from imminent need.

After this, from the Orthodox point of view, the Catholics were simply not using the actual creed and even went against the Ecumenical Councils by adding new doctrine. And from the Catholic point of view, ""procession from the Father and the Son"" is not an addition to ""procession from the Father"" but a precision, implied in the original creed, and it was rightfully modified to fight against Arianism in the West.

________

- **The authority of the Pope**: The Bishop of Rome, called Pope, was always recognized to be the chief among all the bishops. In a given region the chief bishop among the bishops, also called the primate, is the Metropolitan, and in a given part of the world the chief bishop is called Patriarch or Pope or Catholicos, but the Pope of Rome had the additional prerogative of being the chief bishop on a worldwide scale. The Church Fathers bring up three reasons for this: the Pope of Rome is the successor of Peter, who was the chief among the apostles; the city of Rome was the capital of the empire until the 4th century; the Church of Rome has an exceptional track record of orthodoxy (unlike many of the Eastern bishops that fell into heresy). However, there started to be disagreements concerning what the Pope of Rome can actually do and how different his prerogative actually is from that of every other bishop and primate. In the 9th century it started being a real problem as the Pope, who is the Patriarch of Rome, claimed to have deposed the Ecumenical Patriarch, who is the Patriarch of Constantinople, even without being asked to do so by the people of Constantinople. But this was ultimately amicably solved with the next Pope, yet the diverging perspecives on this issue were not addressed. In the 11th century the Gregorian Reform happened and recognized some very high ecclesiastical and secular powers for the Pope, which the Eastern churches saw firsthand in the 13th century when, following the catastrophe of the fourth crusade, the Catholics installed their own bishops and churches in the East and also a Latin Empire. The Council of Florence finally ruled that:

&gt;We also define that the holy apostolic see and the Roman pontiff holds the primacy over the whole world and the Roman pontiff is the successor of blessed Peter prince of the apostles, and that he is the true vicar of Christ, the head of the whole church and the father and teacher of all Christians, and to him was committed in blessed Peter the full power of tending, ruling and governing the whole church, as is contained also in the acts of ecumenical councils and in the sacred canons. Also, renewing the order of the other patriarchs which has been handed down in the canons, the patriarch of Constantinople should be second after the most holy Roman pontiff, third should be the patriarch of Alexandria, fourth the patriarch of Antioch, and fifth the patriarch of Jerusalem, without prejudice to all their privileges and rights.

Note that later on, even stronger divergence would become apparent, as the First Vatican Council defined many things concerning the Pope's ecclesiastical and doctrinal power that the Orthodox simply cannot accept.

________

- **Purgatory**: Catholicism teaches that there is a difference between mortal sin and venial sin. Mortal sin require eternal punishment, which is undone through repentance (especially the sacrament of confession), and venial sin requires teemporal punishment, which is undone through penance. If one has not done sufficient penance, it must be compensated for in Purgatory, a state of the soul after death where it is tormented with fire to remove the worldly attachment that remains so the soul can enter Heaven. Also, one's personal acts that come from faith in Jesus have personal merit, and when one's personal merit is not sufficient to satisfy the temporal punishment that is required, one can have the personal merit of Jesus and the Church applied to them instead: this is called an indulgence. As such, one can receive indulgences by doing certain things; a recent example: in March 2020, a plenary indulgence (meaning an indulgence that's equivalent to enough penance needed to avoid Purgatory altogether) was officially declared for Catholics who catch Covid-19, or who are health workers helping those who are sick with Covid-19, or who do certain acts such as going to certain particular services or doing certain particular prayers in intercession for those who are sick with Covid-19. Orthodox Christians also pray for the dead who are suffering, but there is no concept of temporal punishment that requires penance or of personal merit or of indulgences, and those prayers are usually not thought to be for those in Purgatory but for those in Hell. The Council of Florence defined:

&gt;Also, if truly penitent people die in the love of God before they have made satisfaction for acts and omissions by worthy fruits of repentance, their souls are cleansed after death by cleansing pains; and the suffrages of the living faithful avail them in giving relief from such pains, that is, sacrifices of masses, prayers, almsgiving and other acts of devotion which have been customarily performed by some of the faithful for others of the faithful in accordance with the church's ordinances. Also, the souls of those who have incurred no stain of sin whatsoever after baptism, as well as souls who after incurring the stain of sin have been cleansed whether in their bodies or outside their bodies, as was stated above, are straightaway received into heaven and clearly behold the triune God as he is, yet one person more perfectly than another according to the difference of their merits. But the souls of those who depart this life in actual mortal sin, or in original sin alone, go down straightaway to hell to be punished, but with unequal pains.

Interestingly, the Orthodox at the time seemingly didn't realize that the Catholics believed in personal merit and in indulgences. More differences came to light later as well, notably about original sin, as it has become known, since the Catholics dogmatized their doctrine of the Immaculate Conception (that Mary was conceived without original sin), that the Catholics and the Protestants may have a more bleak understanding of the human condition and of the effects of original sin than the Orthodox do. As a result some Orthodox prefer to speak of ""ancestral sin"".

_________

- **The use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist**: Both Catholics and Orthodox believe the Eucharist, that is, holy communion, to really become Jesus's body and blood. Bread and wine are used for this. However, the Catholics are fine with any kind of bread, but their own tradition is to use unleavened bread. The Orthodox simply don't really consider unleavened bread to count as bread, and consider it inappropriate symbolically (as the people in the Old Testament ate unleavened bread at the Passover to symbolize their poverty when God had brought them in the wilderness toward the promised land, but now that Christians have reached the promised land in the person of Jesus Christ leavened bread should be used, also leaven makes bread rise like Jesus rose from the dead), but then the Catholics are fine with that symbolic meaning and also that of unleavened bread (leaven is used as an image of richness in the Bible, yes, but also as an image of sin, and to use unleavened bread symbolizes Jesus's purity). Either way, this was problematic because, when the Eastern churches realized that the Western churches used unleavened bread for communion, they immediately thought it was proof of heresy about the identity of Jesus, due to the Armenian Apostolic Church (which is Oriental Orthodox - the Eastern Orthodox and the Oriental Orthodox condemned each other as heretics in the 5th century) also using unleavened bread, as well as unmixed wine (the Catholics and Eastern Orthodox use wine mixed with hot water), to symbolize that Jesus has one nature rather than two (this was the doctrinal dispute that led to the schism between the Oriental Orthodox and everyone else - I won't get into details...). Believe it or not, the use of unleavened bread was actually seen as *the* cause behind the schism between Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, in the 11th century, but now people don't care as much. The Council of Florence defined:

&gt;Also, the body of Christ is truly confected in both unleavened and leavened wheat bread, and priests should confect the body of Christ in either, that is, each priest according to the custom of his western or eastern church.

There are other differences when it comes to the sacraments too. Catholicism has a strict list of 7 sacraments, while Orthodoxy does not put a limit to the number of sacraments, although the list of 7 was imported from Catholicism. Catholicism has different ideas about marriage, so that divorce isn't really possible. Catholicism also does confirmation (called chrismation in the East) when someone can consciously choose to be a Catholic, and also does holy communion as a rite of passage, sometimes doing communion before confirmation, while Orthodoxy strictly does confirmation right after baptism and commuion right after confirmation, thereforee revealing a different understanding of what the sacraments mean.

_________________________

All these things were matter of doctrine. There are many other things which are only matters of emphasis and practice, such as Orthodoxy having much more serious fasting practices, but I won't get into that as this reply is already long enough.

________

Now, for Protestantism... This is a difficult topic to navigate around because Protestantism is a fundamentally Western thing, long after the (Western) Catholics and the (Eastern) Orthodox had diverged from one another. Protestantism arose out of a dispute within Catholicism and tons of Protestant doctrines can only be understood in a Catholic context. 

So, instead of explaining what each side believes, as I did above, I will just say what each side says.

The principles of Lutheranism (the ""solae""): ""We are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone as revealed in scripture alone to the glory of God alone."" Orthodoxy would agree that we are saved by the grace of God alone, if this does not exclude the need for us to individually respond to this offer of grace. Orthodoxy would disagree that we are saved through faith alone, but rather we are saved through faith and works. Orthodoxy would agree that we are saved through faith in Christ alone, yet again this faith must be able to produce the works of Christ in us. Orthodoxy would agree that the Bible is the sole source of divine revelation and the highest source and basis of tradition but would also say that it requires interpretation, and the only authoritative interpretation is that of the saints, who preserve and transmit the tradition; and the bishops, the successors of the apostles tasked with teaching this tradition, who teach the faith individually to their own community and together in councils; and the liturgical practices and texts that have been transmitted. Finally, Orthodox would agree that we are saved to the glory of God alone, yet this does not exclude the saints who are the limbs of the body of Christ and so they are venerated, although not worshipped, and their prayers are requested.

The principles of Calvinism (""TULIP""): Total depravity (human nature since the exile from the Garden of Eden is completely unable to choose God or to do anything good); Unconditional election (God has preordained the conversion and salvation of all Christians); Limited atonement (what Jesus did for us was only for those who were preordained to become Christians); Irresistible grace (God's gift of grace for the preordained elect is constantly and always there and cannot be anulled or rejected, and it can only push them toward responding positively to His offer); Perseverance of the saints (those who are preordained by God to salvation will necessarily be saved in the end, so that if they fall away from the faith they will inevitably come to repentance at some point or else they never truly believed). Orthodoxy would say that mankind is fallen and cannot reconcile itself back to God on its own, but it is not completely depraved; divine predestination does not mean that God preordains people to be saved or condemned but rather that He foreknows who will and will not accept His gift and He acts accordingly; what Jesus did was not only for Christians but for the whole world, although it is up to the world to respond; God's offer of grace is indeed always present and we cannot even come to faith without God's grace but this isn't at the detriment of human free will; and if anything is predestined for salvation it is the Church, but it's up to us to belong to the Church or not, and it will only be finalized at the last judgment.

There may be a lot of talking past each other on this, since, again, Orthodoxy and Protestantism have very different histories and are only barely beginning to meet each other.",OrthodoxChristianity

Are Tarot cards always evil? Is it alright to use them for non - divination purposes?,inksane,1600009855,"Hello,

So my questoin is in the title. I know Tarot has a bad reputation for being a tool of divination, but is it always really bad?

I mean they are just pieces of cardboard with images on them. Say if each image represents a situation and you put a few together and juggle it around, then you're really just analysing or running the scenarios of certain situations. That's just probability.

Again, as I understand divination will only be if you asked and entity to show cards to you, or if you believed the card had some power of their own. Which is obviously not good for us.

So is the first situation ever okay or not? I'm interested to hear ideas. Just so you know I do not have or use Tarot cards, I just don't understand the stigma, because other kinds of cards are okay, and if anyone really wanted to, they could do divination with playing cards as well, yet I never hear people saying other cards are evil.",OrthodoxChristianity

Defending the Sacraments against Protestants? (Who claim they bible doesn’t support their use)?,Lord_Have_Mercy123,1599954899,"I am interested in some apologia against protestant claims that the gospels and New Testament epistles do not depict the sacraments as necessary to salvation.

I am aware of the common citations in John and 1 Corinthians for defending the Eucharist and the Gospel of John for defending Baptism. A lot protestants (such as Baptists) dismiss this as something that doesn’t save, but rather is just an optional but recommended symbol. I have even heard the claim that the epistle of James is meant for ‘saved Christians’ who just need exhortation to repent to show ‘proof’ of their salvation. In no way are the world themselves salvific according to the protestant view because salvation is viewed, according to them, not as a process but as a single moment.

I am also aware of the wrong claim that Paul didn’t believe in ‘faith by works’ which is patently false. When he’s talking about the Law, he’s talking about the mosaic law and this was precisely his disagreement with James, not over the necessity of the sacraments. However, does anyone have anything to back this up? Most protestants would simply dismiss any example in the New Testament Canon or the Pauline works as being just a reccomended thing that doesn’t save.

"Can I, and if so How, serve/Pray the Typika as an uneducated Layman?",Lord_Have_Mercy123,1599947606,"Last week I made this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/iolaq3/cant_get_to_church_at_my_spiritual_wits_end/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf . I have to thank everyone a million times for all their thoughtful responses!

I have decided that my best option is to serve or Pray the typika. I do not know any orthodox people at my parish (we have only started attending in the last year and do not talk to people), we lack Orthodox family that normally attends liturgy, let alone that would go during Covid, and online services have not been fruitful in the slightest. For me, I feel best praying the Typika.

I do not want to do it ‘wrong’ or somehow serve it in a way that would be blasphemous. 

I am guessing standing position would be the best position, and I can try to do in front of an icon. I lack access to real icons, so would a picture of one suffice?

Do the gospel and epistle readings correspond to the normal daily readings? Or are they a ‘special’ Typika version?

Do I have to sing, chant or say out loud certain parts for it to ‘count’? Or can I pray it in my head? I will be doing this alone, and in a small building with other people. I can’t sing, and even saying it out loud may be disturbing to other people.

Is there anything else about praying the Typika as a replacement for Sunday Liturgy until I can make it to church again that I should know?

I plan on using this resource: http://www.assemblyofbishops.org/about/scobaresources/military/readers-service

It states as follows: “This service is for Orthodox Lay Leaders in the armed forces and is NOT A SUBSTITUTE for the Divine Liturgy when an Orthodox Priest is available.”

I struggle much with sloth, so I would like to remain vigilant. I feel very guilty for not attending online services, and even moreso for not attending in person services. I truly feel that I do not have any other options, but at the same time, I still feel much guilt over this.

He wasn't a bad person at all so please don't think that he just had a problem with mental health and battled it since he was 12 years old. We have three beautiful babies together who are amazing as well. Maddox Eli is 9 weeks old, Micah Stone is 15 months old, and my oldest little man, Caison Steel is 3 years old.

I feel like a big part of me is gone. I need advice, suggestions, or encouragement would be great. I have two questions:

1. I'm struggling so bad and barely keeping my head above water. I was a SAHM and recently have had to get a job as a receptionist at a mobile home sales place. I desperately need formula for my newborn, diapers for the newborn &amp; one year old, pull ups for my 3 year old, wipes, &amp; food for the older two. **I applied for SNAP which is food stamps and family independence. I am waiting on a letter to do a phone interview and see if I'm approved. Our first WIC appointment is Thursday at 2:45pm. The food pantry here is by appointment only and I made an appointment for Friday at 9:45am. (That's only day they operate on) what else can I do?!? Who else can I reach out to? Am I forgetting to do anything else that you can think of? We don't have a diaper bank here. I researched and no that isn't a thing here apparently. I'm in such a panic because formula is out and food, diapers, and pull ups are close to being out.**

2.**I want to look into cloth diapers. I was told that I can reduce a lot of costs if I could cloth diaper my kids. Is that true? Where do I start? I was told that there are websites or organizations online that offer free cloth diapers to you and you return when finished or you need a bigger size. Anyone know anything about them? Names or web address? Or I know it's a long shot but does anyone have any cloth diapers they don't need or want I could at least try out going cloth and I'll even return if you'd like. Can I cloth diaper both my younger boys? Or is my one year old too big?? Any tips or advice you have is appreciated because I am completely new to this!**

and then the Bishop comes out and admonishes him. 

My impression is that Orthodox priests are more up front and in your face about being “not of this world.” Maybe just because the ones I’ve met have been Slavs and Eastern Europeans who have a certain cultural forwardness.

I know there are plenty of Orthodox prayers that are specifically to Jesus Christ but they (from what little I've seen) are almost always preceded by prayers to the Father individually and followed by prayers to the Holy Spirit individually.  As a former protestant, I still get uncomfortable when I hear, ""Let us pray for x in Jesus Name"" as the way its intended seems to subordinate Christ to the will of the person invoking his Name.  I saw this a lot in my ex girlfriends pentecostal family.  The mom, one awkward family get together, had a big dramatic scene in front of all the family and neighbors and fellow church goers where she was talking/crying to her mother about her having been in a wheel chair the last x amount of decades.  She said that Jesus came to her in a dream and said that today was the day she would be healed and walk again.  She put her hands on her name and said, ""In Jesus Name I command you, get up and walk"".  And then she started pulling up on her mother almost yanking her out of the chair!!!!!!  Obviously, her mother was not healed and everyone was crying.  What's even more disturbing is that this didn't affect the faith of anyone present.  It shook me to the core.

Bear with me I'm new to the Christian faith, can anybody please help me out to understand more about it? I finished to read the bible and this is what I got from it :

It's my understanding that God created us with free will and gave us the gift of eternal life so we can experience the beauty of his creation and be in a relationship of love and joy with him. Because of free will, Adam, through his disobedience, released sin- a disease who infected all humanity with death, depravity, hate, evil and despair. We went further and further away from God creating a big division with him.
God, though, didn't give up on us and used Israel to bring Jesus because we were not able to save ourselves, only God was able to do that by taking human form and die for us.

Many Christians talk about penal substitution which is what I always believed: God being the ultimate definition of good and justice, couldn't accept us in heaven without letting us pay the price of our sins, so he took the wrath on us, paid it for us and whoever believes in him will be forgiven and accepted in the heaven. But we still need to die in this body, and when Christ will return we will be risen with a clean body and free from sin.

Then there's the theory of the victory of Christ. Which is way more complicated for me to understand. Before Jesus, our destiny after death was complete annihilation, so Christ came to take our disease (sin) and suffer death with us so he could destroy Hades (the realm of the dead) and give us again our original purpose which was eternal life with God. But if it was so, why do we still die? Why isn't the kingdom of God already here? Why aren't we immortal and back to the garden with God? Why do we need to wait for the second coming when he could have just destroyed everything 2000 years ago? Why do we still sin?",OrthodoxChristianity

Stick Incense - Surprisingly nice!,BazDim,1599763632,"The incense I use is of the usual grain variety, with either a charcoal briquette/disk in a censor or loose charcoal powder, but recently on a whim I bought some stick incense from Legacy Icons (not a paid ad but if they want to get in touch with me, I *am* out of a job at the moment ...). 

I’ve never used stick incense before, mostly I guess out of a gut-level association with them and the various eastern faiths that use them, and I have to say I am really pleasantly surprised. Easy to light, easy to snuff, minimal mess, minimal smoke, I can pick up the stick and carry it around to cense the house a little easier than doing it with the censor. No fussing with waiting for the charcoal disk to get cool and ashy enough to not burn the incense. Now, it doesn’t really feel as *official* somehow (normally as I set everything up I’m praying, so it feels a little too easy if that makes sense), but overall I think it’s a neat alternative.

Has anyone else tried stick incense? What’s everyone’s incense game like?",OrthodoxChristianity

Can anyone explain what these terms mean in Orthodoxy?,Inevitable_Ad_2637,1599759756,"# This is not a Protestant-bashing thread. I just need some definitions here.

I heard so many definitions and explanations over the past few years, that I am super-confused.

I basically need to speak to a Charismatic/Pentecostal convert to Orthodoxy, who was into doing Charismatic things in-depth--not a dabbler, someone who was fully on board, like me. I wasn't trying to be reckless, I just wanted to know God, and to be close to Him, and to help people along the way, and I thought what I was being taught was the 'real deal'.

&amp;#x200B;

**Grace, or 'charis':** how to obtain it, and how to lose it. Is it an 'empowerment', or something else? 

**Anointing/anointed**. I know what that means in Charismatic/Pentecostal services, but it appears that things are totally different over here.

**Spiritual gifts, and miracles**. From my reading, in Orthodoxy, they seem to...just happen when God says they should happen, and you're not supposed to try to make them happen, or expect them to happen. And they seem to just happen to near-saints/wonderworkers, rather than just everyone, and through suffering and asceticism.

**Hearing the voice of God.** Doesn't seem to happen, unless you're deceived, or unless you're a saint. Seems like actual voices in your head...just don't happen. Possibly...you remember a useful Scripture or a saint quote or something when needed, but you don't hear it as a voice, per se, it's just a sudden idea of something that applies to whatever you're doing (talking with a friend who is hurting, for example).

**Visions.** Charismatics talk about 'open visions' (where you literally see something with your physical eyes) or 'closed visions', (where you just kind of 'sense' what's happening, and can sort of visualize it). I don't see any concept of 'closed visions' in saint stories: either they get unexpected visits from Jesus/Mary/saints, or they don't, and they don't trust them at first (St. Paisios, St. Joseph the Hesychast, and Elder Thaddeus are a few good examples). St. Paisios argued for an hour with Jesus, Mary, and a saint who appeared in front of his door, to make sure that they were not demons. Elder Thaddeus had a vision where an angel told him he would be of great help to Serbians. What did he do? He went to Mount Athos, got kicked out of the monastery because they didn't like him, and went back to Serbia...where he was of great help to Serbians, for the rest of his life.

**Mysticism.** I was part of a movement that was heavy into reviving Catholic mysticism in the present day, but I have no idea how hesychasm works. (Don't worry, I'm not going to read the Philokalia--I can barely read the Bible right now, because I don't know what interpretations are correct, or crap that someone just made up. I know that hesychasm is basically not for anyone who hasn't been Orthodox for a long time, and someone who doesn't have a spiritual elder to whom they are closely accountable, and it involves a lot of heavy, heavy asceticism.

**Feeling the presence of God.** Doesn't seem to happen, really. I mean, when I leave Divine Liturgy, sometimes I feel better, like my soul has been lifted, but I don't literally get chills or anything, like I used to get in Charismatic churches, and I never feel the urge to say 'amen!' or 'hallelujah!' during the homily, whether it's profound or really 'resonates' with me, or not. Charismatic pastors joke about being under air conditioning vents, but I experienced a lot of unmistakable physical feelings for 20 years or so. I know what I'm talking about. Divine Liturgy is something else. I don't 'feel' anything. It seems to be more of a mental thing, where I'm trying to decipher the Greek parts, or looking at the icons, or crossing myself, or reciting the Jesus Prayer.

**Speaking in tongues (Corinthian glossolalia).** I'm not even convinced that what Charismatics do is the same thing as the Corinthians were doing, because of what you do it for. Charismatics use glossolalia to 'recharge their batteries' to do miracles, or enhance discernment, or calm themselves down when they are upset. But I've heard testimonies from converts that they lost the ability to speak in tongues right after they were converted. I've dropped them entirely, in favor of the Jesus Prayer, because I have no need to work miracles, 'prophesy', or do anything Charismatic that I used to do.

**Prophecy/discernment:** Also doesn't seem to happen, unless you're a wonderworker/saint.

That's all I can think of, for now. 

Again, if any of you are converts to Orthodoxy that were heavily into the Charismatic Movement or Pentecostalism--I'm not talking about people who have studied it, I am talking about people who were all in, for years and years, and know what the Elijah List is, and know who Kim Clement and Rick Joyner and Bob Jones and perhaps Mike Bickle are.

Interfaith (dual) baptism? Uncommon practice or not done at all?,brazilianbeaver,1599711688,"Hello, 

Half doctrine and half counselling post coming up!

Orthodox by birth here and re-discovered the faith much later in life. My wife is and has always been a practicing Catholic. For the most part there’s no issue between our interfaith traditions or customs and it’s quite enjoyable between the two. 

We have a child now and our intentions (despite family groans) are to raise them in both faiths respecting both sides which initially included two baptisms... we’re finding out that this certainly is a very unorthodox (pun intended) pathway as it doesn’t seem to be routinely practiced if at all.

If we baptise Orthodox there’s certain Catholic components the child can be a part of such as communion in both sides, but they would miss on on their first Eucharist, whereas if we baptise Catholic there’s no way they could receive orthodox communion.

My wife practices significantly more than I do so you could argue it would be fair to baptise Catholic, but since you can receive Catholic communion as an Orthodox you could also argue the other side. 

I’ve consulted our priest(s) who have recommended that whoever goes to church more should provide the baptism but it seems a shame we can participate equally in both sides. I mean we could just do both baptisms and not tell anyone...

🔴 What Is A Get-Out-Of-Hell-Free Card Christian? 🔥,The_Mission_Channel,1599690298,"“If I hate sin because of the punishment, I have not repented of sin – I merely regret that God is just.” -Spurgeon

📍 Genuine Repentance 

“True repentance has a distinct and constant reference to the Lord, Jesus Christ. If you repent of sin without looking to Christ, away with your repentance! If you are so lamenting your sin as to forget the Savior, you have need to begin all this work over again. Whenever we repent of sin we must have one eye upon sin and another upon the Cross. Or, better still, let us have both eyes upon Christ, seeing our sin punished in Him and by no means let us look at sin except as we look at Jesus. A man may hate sin just as a murderer hates the gallows – but this does not prove repentance. If I hate sin because of the punishment, I have not repented of sin – I merely regret that God is just. But if I can see sin as an offense against Jesus Christ and loathe myself because I have wounded Him, then I have a true brokenness of heart. If I see the Savior and believe that those thorns upon His head were plaited by my sinful words; If I believe that those wounds in His heart were pierced by my heart sins; If I believe that those wounds in His feet were made by my wandering steps and that the wounds in His hands were made by my sinful deeds – then I repent of sin after a right fashion. Only under the Cross can you repent. Repentance elsewhere is remorse which clings to the sin and only dreads the punishment. Let us then seek, under God, to have a hatred of sin caused by a sight of Christ’s love.” -Spurgeon",OrthodoxChristianity

The ‘voice of God’,Inevitable_Ad_2637,1599651435,"Disclaimer: I have mental illness in my background, and have been hospitalized with schizophrenia-like symptoms before. Pretty sure some of that was demonic, too. I have been under treatment, and I am much better now. Most of it had to do with anxiety. 

From my studies, it appears that God speaks to an Orthodox Christian primarily through the purified heart, when the head-heart connection (broken by the Fall) has been repaired, and not the head, as in Western theology. 

Does anyone here have a Protestant Charismatic background, and converted? Did you think you heard form God before? How are things different now? Do you just get a general sense that you should probably wait a few more months to get married, for example, or a specific voice that says, ‘stop, because the next guy is going to run the red light and T-bone you if you don’t listen’, or (something fairly typical for Charismatics) ‘tell the cashier her missing mom’s name is Karen and her phone number is 867-5309’?

The problem I am having is this: I have a voice in my head. I am pretty sure it is me, but there are two voices: one is clearly mine (‘should I wear the red shirt or the blue shirt today?’) and the other sounds like me, but it sounds like it’s a separate voice. 

This voice knows what I am thinking, but can not provide information I do not have in my head (I cannot ask it for the square root of 84847492, or the current leader of Romania, because I do not know that information).

An Orthodox Rebuttable of my Catholic Perspective of Exodus 22,exodusthrowaway777,1599601587,"Hi, Roman Catholic in the depths of scripture trying to find the original Church. I would like to run something past you guys.

The argument of [Exodus 18](http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/hahn.asp) is very convincing. Moses spoke to God directly, ministered the commandments, and appointed administrators of the law beneath him. Large matters were brought to him - small matters were handled locally. This is very reflective of the Catholic hierarchy today.

However, I've found one argument that might just be sufficient for me:

\------------------------------------------------------------------

First I have to answer to myself: Who is the ""symmetry"" of Moses? Is it Peter, or is it the person of Christ? (Granted, there is no ""weight"" that can balance God, but we will proceed)

Surely it is Christ, who says He has come to fulfill the law. Naturally, a counter-argument is that Christ means to fulfill it *by* the establishing of the Chair of Peter. Yet, then why become man? Why not appoint another prophet? For further proof, we have the line:

*That from Moses, the law, and from Christ, grace and truth.*

Though again, it was God gave the law to Moses. But then why say *from Moses?* Because it was delivered in mercy of our hardness of heart, not wholly reflecting the love and beauty of God.

But another idea is to simply look at the visible head of each system. That is, who made the visible appointments of each. Moses of course made his, seen clearly in Exodus (though surely, in mercy, he was guided by God). And clearly, the person of Christ made the appointments of the apostles (guided also by God, being one in the Trinity with God)

So, from this perspective, the Papacy almost looks like an attempt to find a second Moses or another prophet. That is, to return to the unfulfilled OT. To deny that the Word was made flesh and fulfilled Moses' chair, and the prophets' role. To deny that the Spirit has descended upon the Apostles.

Going further, with the coming of Christ and descent of the Spirit, and the reception of the Eucharist and Baptism, people now living in Christ, in faith, are members of His Body. Therefore, to hear the voice of God as Moses did, or to hear the voice of Christ as the Apostles did, the body must come together, thus councils.

*...gathered* *in my name.*

That is, within Me, within Christ, the name, the Word, spoken by God, and the people, most importantly the holy orders, being the appointed representative members of the Body. As Christ deemed it sufficient to ordain and transmit to twelve apostles, reflected in the OT of the division of Moses' hierarchy not being carried to the individual level.

Carried to the extreme, I find it hard to undoubtedly consider a council infallible until the appointed members of the Body are unbroken. Without the person of Christ, we can not be sure the Body is fully present. Thus until the Second Coming, we can only rely upon the mercy of God that He will guide the faithful more tenderly than they deserve, as He has for millennia.

\------------------------------------------------------------------

Carrying this to the end: to grant the Bishop of Rome infallibility is to claim that one man could constitute the Body of Christ, which is the entire mystery and miracle of Christianity. To claim that a man is the Vicar of Christ, is to deny that Christ came in the flesh and was born of the Virgin Mary solely to become His *own* Vicar.

It makes sense to me. Or... have I just become a heretic and Christian conspiracy nut...? Hm.",OrthodoxChristianity

I am making a home Altar with the framed icon of Christ Pantokrator (I am not very interested in Mary), a crucifix, candles and incense.

About marriage and having children,under_the_archways,1599569688,"I am a young single woman who often wonders about this

If it's God's will, some day I might get married and have children. The thing that is a bit scary is that having children raised in the faith often results in them ""rebelling"" or just simply rejecting it and living their lives away from it.

I do plan to raise them in the faith although my fear is when they have a lot of faith questions that quite frankly i can see myself not knowing how to answer. I do hope to be growing in faith until then but even then, I will not be able to answer every single question (nor my spouse)...

I have to clarify I will still love them naturally even if they choose another path in life and I can only do my best but not become a toxic parent when it comes to wanting to reconvert them...

I am also aware there is a similar likely chance that they will follow the Church and have strong faith.

Sorry if this sounded like overthinking, because it kinda is :p but sometimes i think maybe better to remain single my whole life

Which brings me to another question: the vocation thing. A lot of people think the voluntary single life is not a vocation (unlike religious life and married life) but somehow unless someone is homosexual, it becomes required of them to chose the single life. But not if a straight person wants to remain single?... i don't get it

I hope i will find some answers here :)",OrthodoxChristianity

Does Extreme Orthodoxy Exist?,StingyMark,1599535328,"I’m a convert to the orthodox faith and have always felt uneasy about certain customs at my parish.

My goal is to better discern what is truly the faith and what is noise/things to avoid as i walk this new road. 

The customs that make me uneasy or have given me pause are primarily:

-priest discusses in gruesome detail martyr experiences in front of children regularly.

-priest sending out news stories from very biased/questionable sources about how congregation should feel scandalized.

-Priests giving homily, pre-communion type homily, post liturgy announcements that becomes a homily, prayer over the food that includes a mini homily, etc.

-Our Father said in all present languages individually during liturgy (adding sometimes 10-15 minutes, haven’t seen this anywhere else)

-inability to fully accept Priest as spiritual father due to the items above. 

-majority of young adults or children in parish appear focused on becoming nuns or monks. My only concern is the sheer volume of young people letting the idea of a family go at such an early age.",OrthodoxChristianity

I haven’t been able to get to church since March. I am seventeen. I don’t have a car, and can’t take public transportation. My parents think doing a bible study is enough, but I don’t agree. I have tried online services. I am not sure if my parish has any because they don’t really update their website very well.

I don’t feel present.

I just don’t. I am not sure how to participate in online services. I don’t feel close to God. I’m not sure what or how to pray to participate, so I just gave up. Hoping I’d be able to attend in person services again soon. Soon hasn’t happened yet.

How do I participate in online services?

I just end up repeating the Jesus prayer, but what the point of attending the online service then? I have trouble following them even in the rare case that they happen to be in English. What do I do? What Have you guys been doing?

To complicate matters further, in staying with some family for a few weeks who are Christians but don’t fast. I don’t believe they will have any vegan foods for wedsadayd and Friday’s. Dinners for sure, but for breakfasts and lunch as well. What do I do? Just give up on that too?

Prayer request for a premature baby,BazDim,1599520625,"Hello. My cousin just gave birth prematurely and there have been complications. The baby was born not breathing and was sent to intensive care to receive oxygen. After a couple of days he woke up for the first time, but there are issues with some organs and doctors are uncertain. The child's name is Orion, if I could selfishly ask for you all to pray for little Orion's health and recovery.

I also have a secondary but related thing I want to bring up, and I'm going to feel silly doing so I hope you understand. There's a long tradition of prophetic dreams on my mother's side where someone correctly predicts a death. My grandfather almost never dreams, but when he does he dreams of someone dying and more often than not it happens. A month ago my mother (on the same side) dreamt that there would be an infant death in the family. Now, I don't know how much stock I put in dreams and I've always been a bit skeptical that dreams could mean anything, but I can't deny a pretty decent track record of dreams on my mother's side correctly predicting deaths. Anyways... I don't know if I'm reading into it or what, but it's left me very concerned for Orion.

I'm rambling... I guess in summary if everyone could pray for Orion, and for those who care to if I could maybe get some opinions on my second point. Thank you.",OrthodoxChristianity

Orthodox views on the end times?,mantooangrytoquit,1599469155,"Hi everyone

A bit of background: I was brought up in a Protestant household and have recently started going to church again. One thing which really bothered me and caused me to initially leave the church was the unconditional support for Zionism as a fulfillment of ""end times prophecy"". I was taught that good Christians were meant to support Zionism/building of the Third Temple as those who cursed Israel would supposedly be cursed. 

Furthermore, I was told that it was necessary to be part of the Great Commission, which was interpreted as flying off to ""unreached"" countries to preach to the people there (100% of which were developing countries). Through a combination of these two elements, it would be possible for prophecy to be fulfilled and Jesus to return as soon as possible.

As this may be a very Protestant-centric view of prophecy and modern politics (maybe even radical), I am curious to know what the Orthodox Christian view of the end times is (preferably with historical sources) as I don't really accept what I was taught.

If you want to change your destiny for the better.  
 If you want to live up to 200 years old or even longer.  
 If you want to get richer, smarter and look more beautiful/handsome.  
 Then this is a special gift and the most value information you can find on the internet in 2020.  
 

Most people are living based on old traditional and influenced by families, societies rather than the Earth environment and personal choice. You must change your lifestyle if you want to have a better life, there is no any other choice.  
 

I will you give some advice with little change, easy to do but with significant result like a magic wand. This is beyond any education you can receive or have learn so far about life.  
 

**Lifestyle**  
 \- Remove all the hair in your all body as much as possible from legs,hands to any sensitive spot.  
 Because hair are just human body waste just like urine, shit. Unless you want to keep it for fashion,otherwise, there is no any reason to keep it.  
 \- Sleep when the moon is up (before 8 pm), and wake up when the sun start giving the light (around 6-7 am). The healing power is much stronger when the moon is up, and your body will be healed faster better during this time.  
 \- Take a bath 30 – 60 minutes everyday. Swimming pool is better than Bathtub is better than Shower.  
 \- Massage your body with your own hands without any tools.  
 \- Turn off, avoid television, computer, phones as much as possible. Only using it for communication with others or seeking for some information you really looking for.  
 \- Do not take any drugs, medicine, vaccines.  
 

**Diet**  
 You must have an better diet with some time restriction, you cannot eat whatever whenever you want just like those animals. Instead, you should only have 1-2 meals a day, and each meal is within 30-60 minutes.  
 

**An example diet for 7 days you should try:**  
 \- 1 Day: Freestyle eat whatever at whenever you want.  
 \- 2 Day: 1 meal with only fresh raw fruits, vegetable, 1 meal with with cooked foods including both seafood and meat.  
 \- 2 Day 1 meal with raw fresh fruits,vegetables, 1 meal with cooked vegan products only.  
 \- 2 Day: both 2meals only with raw fresh fruits, vegetables.  
 

The amount of foods is up to your choice but eat as little as possible. Meat/seafood should never above 100 gram per meal.  
 Eat a lot of spicy/bitter/sour fruits, leafs as possible, they are the natural “cure” for all kind of virus, bacteria, toxin in human body.  
 Eat a lot of green leafs as possible, try green smoothie.  
 You can pick the eating hour/day you like and match with your daily business.  
 

**Foods you should avoid:**  
 \- GMOs foods, foods contain artificial chemicals such as processed foods.  
 \- Raw or medium rare meat. All should be well done cooked.  
 \- Coffee, tea.  
 

Above is the magic formula you should give it a try right now if you want to change your destiny for the better.  
 Words are meaningless, science are crap, the only thing real is real life results.  
 

I can guarantee you can live up to 200 years old with just a simple formula like above.  
 

If you have any questions related to human health, lifestyle, you can ask me at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com** but only till **17/08/2020.**  
   
 The only thing can prove me as the real Savior is via real life result,all kind of words are meaningless. Give it a try to check guys gals !!!

Question from a Catholic: Why isn't the Ukrainian Orthodox Church widely accepted by other patriarchates?,LegatusMaximus,1599327356,"Good afternoon to my fellow Orthodox brothers and sisters! I hope you are all well!

Recently, I was looking into the newly-made Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU). I know it was founded two years ago with permission from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. However, Moscow (as well as a few others) rejected this church's autocephaly, citing that the Ecumenical Patriarchate had no power to grant it such and that it violated tradition, with some orthodox on social media even saying that the CIA and the ""west"" are trying to destroy the Orthodox Church. 

This was despite accusations that Moscow has been funding pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine (justifying independence from a ""bully"" that is Russia). 

To me, it sounds like Kyiv was just trying to leave a bad relationship with Moscow, only to earn a lot of criticism in doing so. So why, other than debates over apostolic powers and tradition, has the Patriarchate of Ukraine not been accepted entirely by the Orthodox Church? (This is unless I have a bad understanding of this complex situation and the powers of patriarchs. Please correct me if I am wrong). 

I know this, as well as other patriarchate issues like that in Montenegro, are emotional topics for the orthodox world, and I will pray for peace among the patriarchs and their churches.",OrthodoxChristianity

Hello (My Testimony),cadence_and_cascade,1599218219,"Hi am a Protestant in the process of converting to Orthodoxy. A bit about me, I'm a huge art nerd. Fine art, music, architecture, and much more. I see it as a method on how man explores the unseen realms and potential which nature has to offer (like looking at an unfinished jigsaw puzzle and visualising what the gaps may look like), all put into song, or on a canvas, or on a stage. But Protestantism, it lacks these.

Now, don't worry, I like being technical and logical too, I did my research on church history, and my main questions about Orthodoxy have been answered through the study of your church (especially, and you guessed it, saints and veneration), as well as talking to a lot of Orthodox Christians online. But the thing is, before I did all of these things, I was terrified. 
Distraught, torn apart, to the point of crying and confusion because of how divided the Protestant sect is. The 30,000 denominations is a myth, it includes all of Christianity and in fact ⅔ of that number belongs to independent denominations (Mormons, JWs) and the term 'denomination' was used very loosely. It actually has about 9,000. So I decided to be a non-denom. Yet, I knew I couldn't remain it forever.

I had no sense of belonging, nothing to identify with, no culture, only the word 'Christian'. And I saw this as enticing at first. Nothing but me and God, journeying through life, him teaching me directly, with no one to hold us back. And there were times where I was strong, but also times I was incredibly weak in faith. I knew God existed, its just that I didn't know anything else. I had my foundation, but the rest of the house wasn't there. Pretty much every Christian I talked to all had a different interpretation of scriptures or none at all (that's sola scriptura for you), my family belongs to a Pentecostal church and the tongues seem so off. It's like everyone magically has them when the pastor tells them too, the pastor has said the exact same sounds for years upon years every Sunday, usually it was depicted in the scriptures as something out of there will, usually only having up to 3 members with an interpreter alongside, and if there was none it would be done to themselves. A divided kingdom cannot stand, and originating from someone who held the doctrine of neo-papasim who had daddy issues and detracted from the bible I had to face the truth. 

Whereas with Orthodoxy, everything is uniform. You can actually tell that it's Orthodox art, an Orthodox church, or an Orthodox liturgy without have to know the name. The people all actually believe in the same thing, they know there stuff, and if they don't know something they're bound to learn it. You actually can trace your information and know they are facts. There is structure, there is stability, and it's not corrupt. It's true to the Word. 

So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by letter from us.
2 Thessalonians 2:15 NASB

And many Protestants err away for a sheer misunderstanding of these traditions. The fact that I can finally accept the verses likewise to the cloud of witnesses (Heb 12:1), and that I bear the knowledge of the saints in heaven who intercede and pray along with me is so comforting. I actually prayed to St. Ermelinda of Meldert and Mother Mary for intercession and it gave me so much more confidence in prayer to God to heal my leg, and whilst it is still stiff and sore in some places  it was way better than beforehand. I've also felt way more joyful over the course of these days too, less miserable, like a new heart has been made in me. 

After researching and studying all of these things, I prayed my last prayer on this topic. If this is where you want me to go, God, may you lead. With tears running down my face out of true happiness and peace. I believe God was using my love for art as a tool to take me down this rabbit hole, because I noticed how I would constantly look at icons, look at the materials used, dates they were made, and a tug on my soul to learn more and more. 

I won't officially call myself Orthodox until I get confirmed and baptised, but just know that this is definitely something I don't want to leave. I may post some general stuff, but I most likely see myself posting questions. Thank you to anyone who's read and finished this post, God bless.",OrthodoxChristianity
Eastern Orthodoxy and views on Supersessionism,consideringcatholic,1599202401,"I was wondering what the Eastern Orthodox view on the theological idea of Supersessionism, that Christians have replaced Jews as God's chosen people, and whether Eastern Orthodoxy adheres to Supersessionism?

Related to this topic, What is the Eastern Orthodox view on the deicide charge against Jews, both the Jews at the time of Jesus and the modern Jews of today? Does the Eastern Orthodox Church believe that Jews were, or are, guilty of deicide which was the general view of the Catholic Church before Vatican II, or does the EO Church take the view that is prevalent in the Post-Vatican II Catholic Church that Jews were not, or are no longer, guilty of deicide?

Spiritual Experiences and New Faith,SaintFinnVII,1599185704,"I have been attending an Orthodox Church for the past month. I am a college student and have had an interesting spiritual background. I grew up mostly in a non denominational church. After high school I attended a Discipleship Training School with YWAM (Youth with a Mission) for 5.5 months. It was there that I was awakened to the reality of spiritual gifts being active and the first time I genuinely felt the tangible, amazing love of the Father. 

Recently as I was praying, I heard to go check out the Orthodox Church to learn there, and man have I learned a lot! It has got me to dig into a ton of church history, biblical canon, and so forth. I have been confronted with a lot of very good challenges to what I have been raised with, a majority of which makes sense to me. It will probably take a bit for me to grasp the practice of praying with saints/asking them to pray for us, but the explanations I've heard make sense. 

The main thing I struggle with I guess relates to experiencing God. In my community, we do spontaneous worship, which is a beautiful thing and I have felt the Spirit so much during it (and I understand the debates against feelings, but I definitely am able to discern between what is me and what is Him (also God is emotional in all the right ways, He created emotions)). People give words of knowledge to each other in ways that encourage them; physical healing happens (my own leg grew out after prayer due to me shattering my ankle); I've heard demons leaving people and it being replaced with the peace of God that surpasses all understanding; walking downtown with my best friend and spiritual brother we have prayed for people with knowledge of what may be going on in them from God. It is daily living by the Holy Spirit guiding throughout my life and thoughts (how He usually speaks to me). 

I cannot deny what I have seen and experienced. I have not been able to find anyone from this walk of life who came to Orthodoxy.. I know the gifts are generally accepted albeit they seem to be told as rare and only among those in more spiritual states such as St. Seraphim of Sarov. **So I guess my question is what do I do with all of these real experiences?** I can't deny seeing people healed physically and emotionally, by the grace of God. 

I read an article on an Orthodox site that said spontaneous worship and an outpouring of gifts and such were prevalent among the Apostle's gatherings but also included some structure later on such as the Eucharist, fasting, Psalms etc. but that it should be a mix of structure and an active participation in the giftings that the Holy Spirit gives. Jesus said that you will do greater things than He did while on Earth! He raised the dead, healed those around Him, hung out with the druggies and prostitutes and the ones people don't agree with. So why do I not see this in the Orthodox faith? 

**Another question I have is what is the Orthodox response to making new disciples in genuinely unreached areas?** Like in Iran, where the fastest growing body of believers is right now. I know many Muslims who have had a dream of the Man in White (Jesus) and turned to Him. Are we supposed to put them in an Orthodox Church or have them practice the Traditions? 

All in all, I'm just quite confused right now as I see validity on both sides. Cheers.",OrthodoxChristianity

As an Ethiopian orthodox who has been a practicing Christian my whole life, I am honestly very displeased with the (ridiculously) inaccurate translation. I have seen the original book, read the Amharic translation, and learned from scholars who study such hegemonies for a living, and the translation is really terrible and looks like a very deliberate action to distort the history and culture of this Ethiopian saint for some political gain. It absolutely has no context whatsoever of our culture and church traditions. It is deliberately misinterpreted. Another disappointing thing about it is the fact that it was published by one of the world's best higher education centers that reflects on ""the complex interplay between the political, economic, and cultural forces that shape our understanding of the historic achievements and struggles of African-descended people.""

Two Greek
One Ukrainian
One Antiochan (I've been googling and I think this is correct, apparently some of the service is in Arabic)

How to tell your spouse you're considering orthodoxy,petoot,1599140933,"My wife and I have been attending a non-denom pentecostal church for a long time (we met and were married in it).

For over a year I've had the desire to explore church history, and long-story-short, I'm very attracted to Orthodox Christianity. In my opinion it has the most continuity with the early church, and I just can't imagine Pentecostalism, particularly the Word of Faith movement, jiving with the early church. I've even managed to reconcile myself to those doctrines that offend protestants, such as praying to the saints, praying for the dead, venerating icons etc. although it has taken me a while.

However I'm not sure how to talk to my wife about this. She definitely has objections to the above doctrines, and doesn't enjoy traditional services in general. It's like the polar opposite as to what our experience of Christianity has been so far. I don't feel compelled to convince her, but I at least want to communicate clearly why I'm attracted to Orthodoxy, let alone adequately explain what Orthodox Christianity is.

Question about the Intercession of the Theotokos,Bloodacid95,1599104943,"Last Sunday I went to a Greek Orthodox Cathedral in my home town, and the retiring priest (have a great retirement, Fr. Stephen and welcome Fr. Dan) said the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (not sure if any of that mattered). In the Liturgy there was a particular line that popped out at me and I just couldn't quite understand it: ""Through the intercession of the Holy Theotokos, Save us."" What does this really mean? 

Coming from a non-denominational protestant background, I understand salvation as purely Christ's doing. I don't understand how the Virgin Mary had anything to do with my salvation. The wording is kinda strange too. Christ died for our sins directly (Christ -&gt; Mary, the saints, &amp; me); while, ""through the intercessions of the Theotokos, save us"" implies Mary played a role in our Salvation (Christ -~~Mary &amp; the saints~~-&gt; me). It was all Christ, wasn't it?

My catholic roommate from college taught me how Saintly Intercession works. You can pray to a Saint who asks Jesus on your behalf to help you on a math test, or a job interview, or guidance after your mother passes away, etc. I just can't seem to understand how that can help with salvation. Either you are already saved in Christ Jesus or you're not.

This is testimonial and a prayer request. 

I am going to take an exam tomorrow. This is my second attempt. When I first took it (almost 2 months ago) I was extremely confident that I was going to pass. I even had a screensaver stating “passed my exam on first try.” I only started praying a couple of weeks leading up to the big day. I was certain I was going to pass. The day before my exam, I was a wreck. Very nervous and cried a lot...
Since I had prayed beforehand, anointed myself with Holy-oil, had my friends pray for me, I thought God will grant me the good news...fast forward to 3 days, I revived heart wrenching news, I didn’t pass and I was very close from passing. I was devastated. Hated my life, I was embarrassed, said some things to God, couldn’t see the reason behind it especially after how hard I’ve studied and others who did not even put half the effort passed. I was bitter and so angry at God for a couple of weeks. Then I slowly started to pray, ask God to forgive me for all I’ve said and done in anger...I slowly realized that I had been astray  from God. I had forgotten that I am not deserving of anything. Just because I prayed for 2 weeks and I had been silent for months prior made me understand that I only needed God when I was desperate and if I prayed, it will be mine. 
Long story short, I have learned my lesson. No matter what, be thankful and trust God. 
Going into my second attempt (which is tomorrow), I’m more calm and relaxed. I told myself whatever happens happen. Pass of fail, life will go on and I am thankful that God used my failure to bring me closer to him. 

Pray for me as I write my exam tomorrow.

Catholic vs Orthodox Sacraments,SlavaIsusuChristu333,1599087786,"This has been discussed with me rather loosely in a couple of separate posts.  I just wanted to bring the discussion to a single place, if anyone would care to inform me.

Catholics view all Orthodox Sacraments as valid but illicit (due to not being in communion)

Some Orthodox view Catholic Sacraments as valid but illicit (same reasoning)

Some Orthodox view some Catholic Sacraments as invalid and illicit while others are Valid but illicit

Some Orthodox view all Catholic Sacraments as invalid and illicit

Why is there such a wide range of views on something that should be uniform in the various Orthodox Churches?  Recognizing the validity/Christ's Presence in a Sacrament should be a simple yes/no scenario that I would imagine all Orthodox would be in agreement on.  What factors are at play here that make some Orthodox Churches accept Catholic Sacraments and others not?  Even within a Church, there is variation.  For example, individual priests may bring a Catholic into the Orthodox Church with Chrismation only, others with a rebaptism and Chrismation, some with only a profession of faith?

Roman Catholic trying to defend Orthodoxy,SlavaIsusuChristu333,1599086981,"I am still technically a Roman Catholic (journeying eastward) who finds himself on traditional catholic forums often.  I have recently been finding myself trying to defend the Orthodox church numerous times against a group of Catholics who think nothing kind of the EO and OO churches.  My defense of Orthodoxy only goes as far as correcting them when they are criticizing something unfairly or intentionally/unintentionally misrepresent what I know the Orthodox to believe.  I am all for fair criticism for or against Orthodoxy, but don't want to see a bunch of Catholics arguing against Orthodoxy when they aren't even accurately stating the Orthodox position.

In a debate about papal primacy, the argument came up about how both sides quote mine each other (which was something discussed on this forum recently).  Naturally nobody invests the time to go one-by-one to offer a rebuttal for each individual quote from a saint that either seems to support or deny papal supremacy.  Besides quote mining (on either side) being intellectually dishonest as, inevitably, these quotes are likely taken out of context, is there a single solid way to argue against this?

I saw on an old reddit someone mentioned that the problem with the litany of saints who are quote mined in support of papal supremacy is that they amount to nothing more than flowery words.  That there is no support from the historical record of the bishop of Rome exercising authority over an Eastern Church in the first millennia of Christianity.  This sounded like a really convincing argument to me.  Could anyone elaborate further on this or perhaps offer another rebuttal to this strategy of quote mining?  I want to keep engaging at the Trad Cath forum but don't want arguments to get off topic and devolve into this quote mining nonsense but for now, these Catholics hold up their long list of quotes from various Saints/Fathers as though it were dogma.  It's hard to reason with them without a convincing argument as to why their argument is not valid.",OrthodoxChristianity

Hello my brothers and sisters of the Orthodox faith. I come to you with a sincere question and concern. I am an American who practices in the Greek Orthodox Church. In a discussion on another social media platform, I was discussing about the necessity of politics and religion being separate. Someone replied calling me a “Phanariot” and was unsure to this term. After doing some research, it appears to be a slur against the Greek Orthodox Church and I’m confused on why a fellow Orthodox Christian, though of a different Patriarchy, would quantify or qualify my orthodoxy. I know that this would be a question directly for them to answer, but is this becoming a common practice? 

In my search, I found only 1 orthodox website using that term in the same manner: orthochristian.com. Is this supposed to be a reliable Orthodox website or is it a laity website not under the Church? I can’t find an answer there.

Question about my faith.,kappaLmaoKapPA2030,1599067689,"Sooooo, I’ll start off like this. For the past few months, I’ve been feeling pretty depressed, with good times and bad times. I’ve been worrying about having committed the unforgivable sin, by sinning wilfully, thinking I’ll just be forgiven, why bother repenting I’ll just repent later or something... bad, really bad thinking. I’ve been helped a lot by you guys, and gals, and I mean a lot.

I think I came to the conclusion that only Jesus can judge my heart, and weather I sinned wilfully for too much that I hardened my self, or weather my heart is still not fully hardened, only He knows. Either way, I’ll keep repenting, praying and believing, softening my heart and hoping for the best. I’ve somewhat managed to drop porn, I’m reading erotic stories at times but I want to drop that too. 

At some point I was so confused, so tired, so depressed and maybe angry you could say. My faith probably dropped to a low level. I starting thinking that maybe it’s all false, maybe even wished it was ( again, I was depressed and angry) but deep down, in my heart, I believed, and I still believe, and I still love and will for ever love Jesus. I’ll get what I deserve once my end comes, and I know Jesus knows my heart and He will judge me rightly so. Did I harden my heart? Did I not? Only He can judge.

What I want to ask is weather believers have went trough some stages like I did. Of anger, sadness, doubt, but came out of the other end with an even stronger faith. I can’t prove Jesus is real, maybe my brain is angered, depressed, but deep down, I will always believe in my heart. And I believe. And I love Him, and I’m sorry for sinning like I did, wilfully and hardening my self. Hopefully it’s not too late, i don’t know. I’ll repent, believe, and love Him. I’ll get what I deserve.

Without being learned enough on Patristics to fully understand the actual/historical context of each individual statement, it's hard to know what is being taken out of context or not.

I'm Seeking Clarity,jahshoewah,1598979717,"Over the past couple of months I have discovered and been discovering more about orthodox christianity (i was raised southern baptist protestant). One issue I have been struggling with clarity on is the prayers to the Saints and to Theotokos. I don't really have much hesitation about it but I never felt I truly understood the biblical backing of it. Today I was reading to daily Epistle reading (Timothy 2:1-7) and i saw the part where Paul says  ""*For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony to which was borne at the proper time. For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.""*

When I read the 'one mediator' part it confused me again. I was understanding that prayers directed to Saints and Theotokos were in part to ask for them to plead to God on our behalf. Wouldn't this be 'mediating' and contradicting what Paul states here?

On this day, we also commemorate our Saviour's entry into the synagogue in Nazareth, where He was given the book of the Prophet Esaias to read, and He opened it and found the place where it is written, ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, for which cause He hath anointed Me..."" (Luke 4:16-30).

For example, various diets are prescribed for health reasons and may include abstaining from certain foods or fasting altogether. As Orthodoxy has a guideline of fasting and diet restriction, did any tradition form around these concepts as related to a mind/body/spirit health system?

"The difference between Original Sin and Ancestral Sin is an imaginary polemic, and the propagation of this misunderstanding must cease",et_parthenos,1598892616,"Is it ironic I went with a polemical title in order to attack a polemic? Hmm, there's almost something to be said about the cycle of hate and the sins of our fathers there... well, who cares - I'm too dumb to parse that out. 

What is hopefully in my ability, however, is to show y'all that the Original/Ancestral sin distinction is only made up for polemical purposes, and it ought to be dropped. There are enough real differences between the Catholic and Orthodox Church - we ought not go around making more. Now that I have y'alls attention hopefully, I do want to proceed in a most charitable spirit because we all know faith isn't to be taken lightly. Some of y'all I think will earnestly hold to these distinctions, so it's my goal to show you that they aren't really grounded in the Deposit of Faith.

**WHAT IS CLAIMED**

A lot of the blame for this is often put on St. Augustine, and I've even seen it ventured by a few Orthodox today that his sainthood is suspect. All I can say, if there's ever been a man who all read whatever they wanted out of him, it's him - he gets it on all sides from the Orthodox to the Calvinists. I'm going to leave poor Augustine alone for a minute and just focus on some current Orthodox claims. [I'll quote from the OCA websit](https://www.oca.org/questions/teaching/original-sin)[e](https://www.oca.org/questions/teaching/original-sin) because it includes the Toronto catechism which I'll touch on later: 

&gt;Concerning the original—or “first”—sin, that committed by Adam and Eve, Orthodoxy believes that, while everyone bears the consequences of the first sin, the foremost of which is death, only Adam and Eve are guilty of that sin. Roman Catholicism teaches that everyone bears not only the consequence, but also the guilt, of that sin.

I'm building my argument on the basis that this is what is usually claimed. If you think that's an unfair description of it, please let's start by discussing that.

**WHAT CATHOLICISM TEACHES**

So this's the claim: Catholicism teaches 'original guilt,' or more specifically that we participate in the Original Sin ontologically by being human. I will make two distinctions of ""teaches"" - that of the historical understanding and that of the current understanding. I'm going to mostly focus on the current teaching in this post, leaving the historical understanding to a much more thorough article I'll post at the end. As my Orthodox Deacon once said about the Oriental Orthodox, ""Regardless of their past, we have to look at what they currently teach. If today they're teaching the Orthodox faith, then we have little problem.""

I'll submit two articles - one from the Baltimore Catechism and one from the current:

&gt;**Q. 257. Is it not unjust to punish us for the sin of our first parents?**  
&gt;  
&gt;A. It is not unjust to punish us for the sin of our first parents, because their punishment consisted in being deprived of a free gift of God; that is, of the gift of original justice to which they had no strict right and which they willfully forfeited by their act of disobedience.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Q. 258. But how did the loss of the gift of original justice leave our first parents and us in mortal sin?**  
&gt;  
&gt;A. The loss of the gift of original justice left our first parents and us in mortal sin because it deprived them of the Grace of God, and to be without this gift of Grace which they should have had was to be in mortal sin. As all their children are deprived of the same gift, they, too, come into the world in a state of mortal sin.

Note here that the Baltimore Catechism does not speak of Original Sin as some sort of extra stain added onto our being, but rather a deprivation - the absence of something. I'd say this is amenable to the Orthodox understanding of sin &amp; death as the turning away from and denial of God, who is the source of Existence itself. This difference is much greatly expanded upon in the current catechism:

&gt;**404** How did the sin of Adam become the sin of all his descendants? The whole human race is in Adam ""as one body of one man"".293 By this ""unity of the human race"" all men are implicated in Adam's sin, as all are implicated in Christ's justice. Still, the transmission of original sin is a mystery that we cannot fully understand. But we do know by Revelation that Adam had received original holiness and justice not for himself alone, but for all human nature. By yielding to the tempter, Adam and Eve committed a *personal sin*, but this sin affected the *human nature* that they would then transmit *in a fallen state*.294 It is a sin which will be transmitted by propagation to all mankind, that is, by the transmission of a human nature deprived of original holiness and justice. **And that is why original sin is called ""sin"" only in an analogical sense: it is a sin ""contracted"" and not ""committed"" - a state and not an act.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**405** Although it is proper to each individual,295 **original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants.** It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper to it, subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin - an inclination to evil that is called concupiscence"". Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ's grace, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God, but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man and summon him to spiritual battle.

Regardless of whatever you want to say about Augustine, can you honestly say that Rome today officially teaches contracted Original Sin? Sure, you can perhaps call Rome shifty &amp; baseless for changing their positions, but that's entirely different from claiming ""Roman Catholicism teaches that everyone bears not only the consequence, but also the guilt, of that sin.""

**WHAT ORTHODOXY TEACHES**

Let's step away from the modern apologetic tradition to consider the Apostolic Tradition - how has the Orthodox Church historically taught Original Sin? First a quote from St. Symeon the New Theologian (Kudos to u/valegrete for his excellent findings)

&gt;But in this is expressed that mystery of our Faith, that **human nature is sinful from its very conception**. God did not create man sinful, but pure and holy. But since the first-created Adam lost this garment of sanctity, not from any other sin but from pride alone, and became corruptible and mortal, **all people who come from the seed of Adam are participants of the ancestral sin from their very conception and birth. He who has been born in this way, even though he has not yet performed any sin, is already sinful through this ancestral sin.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**For this reason there has come another birth, or rebirth, which regenerates man through Holy Baptism by the Holy Spirit, again unites him with the Divine nature** as it was when he was created by the hands of God, restores all the powers of his soul, renews them and brings them to the condition in which they were before the transgression of first-created Adam.   
&gt;  
&gt;**For after the transgression of Adam no one even among the righteous could be saved, since all men were subject to the sin of the forefather Adam, to corruption and death,** and the fiery sword allowed no one into the Paradise from which Adam had been banished, since those holy mansions of Paradise receive only souls which are immaculate and pure from every sin... For by themselves they could not again come into the incorruption from which Adam had fallen away. \[Homily 37, 3-5\]

I ask you, is this different from what you just read in the Catholic Catechism? Does it even seem to go further into - dare I say - Augustinian territory?

Now consider this decree from the [Orthodox Synod of Jerusalem](http://www.crivoice.org/creeddositheus.html) which declared Calvinism a heresy (And interestingly seems to use the exact same words to describe the Real Presence that a Catholic would):

&gt;We believe the first man created by God to have fallen in Paradise, when, disregarding the Divine commandment, he yielded to the deceitful counsel of the serpent. And as a result hereditary sin flowed to his posterity; so that everyone who is born after the flesh bears this burden, and experiences the fruits of it in this present world. But by these fruits and this burden we do not understand \[actual\] sin, such as impiety, blasphemy, murder, sodomy, adultery, fornication, enmity, and whatever else is by our depraved choice committed contrarily to the Divine Will, not from nature. For many both of the Forefathers and of the Prophets, and vast numbers of others, as well of those under the shadow \[of the Law\], as well as under the truth \[of the Gospel\], such as the divine Precursor, and especially the Mother of God the Word, the ever-virgin Mary, did not experience these \[sins\], or such like faults. But only what the Divine Justice inflicted upon man as a punishment for the \[original\] transgression, such as sweats in labor, afflictions, bodily sicknesses, pains in child-bearing, and, finally, while on our pilgrimage, to live a laborious life, and lastly, bodily death.

And finally, a point addressed in that Original OCA email - [the Toronto Catechism](http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0122/_PI.HTM). This was compiled by an Archbishop, so we ought not dismiss his words out of hand.

&gt;That is original sin. And its consequences?   
&gt;  
&gt;A.) Spiritual death. That is, the separation of man from God, the source of all goodness.   
&gt;  
&gt;B.) Bodily death. That is, the separation of the body from the soul, the return of the body to the earth.   
&gt;  
&gt;C.) The shattering and distortion of the ""image."" That is, darkness of mind, depravity and corruption of the heart, loss of independence, loss of free will, and tendency towards evil. Since then ""the imagination of man's heart is evil ""(Genesis 8:21). Man constantly thinks of evil.   
&gt;  
&gt;D.) Guilt. That is, a bad conscience, the shame that made him want to hide from God.   
&gt;  
&gt;E.) Worst of all, original sin is hereditary. It did not remain only Adam and Eve's. As life passes from them to all of their descendants, so does original sin. We all of us participate in original sin because we are all descended from the same forefather, Adam.   
&gt;  
&gt;This creates a problem for many people. They ask, Why should we be responsible for the actions of Adam and Eve? Why should we have to pay for the sins of our parents? they say. Unfortunately, this is so, because the consequence of original sin is the distortion of the nature of man. Of course, this is unexplainable and belongs to the realm of mystery, but we can give one example to make it somewhat better understood. Let us say that you have a wild orange tree, from which you make a graft. You will get domesticated oranges, but the root will still be that of the wild orange tree. To have wild oranges again, you must regraft the tree. This is what Christ came for and achieved for fallen man, as we shall see in the following sections.

**MY CONCLUSION**

I'll end this by saying, personally I am entirely amenable to a more 'Eastern' understanding of Original Sin, but it is just such a sham to claim that this 'Eastern' understanding has always been held by the East &amp; the St. Augustine ruined the west. He wrote letters to St. Cyril during the Pelagian controversy - the man was not some lone idiot laying the groundwork for the Legalistic Imperial Papacy ^(TM). Furthermore, any allusions to a ""Latin Captivity"" are just inane - to do so is to create a Byzantinized-Great Apostasy theorem. 

I could dig deeper into some implications of this, such as St. John the Wonderworker's treatise on the Immaculate Conception, but I'll refrain for now - this is all a lot to digest &amp; consider, so I hope to give him the time and respect he deserves.

I noted at the beginning that I'd refrain from touching on the historical presentation in the West. [As promised, here's a wonderful article](https://journal.orthodoxwestblogs.com/2019/01/24/original-and-ancestral-sin-a-church-dividing-issue/) that covers that base &amp; explains how we got to the apologetical divergence we see today.

You Should Wonder How The World Savior Will Appear And Help Save This Civilization,modem_bridge,1598841216,"**You Should Wonder How The World Savior Will Appear And Help Save This Civilization**  
 

In most religions, there is a prophecy about the end times when humanity lost the direction of life.  
 But there is a hope called as the World Savior like Messiah, Mahdi, Maitreya, Kalki, Christ, Saoshyant, Buddha, etc.  
 

**You need to ask who made those prophecy and how to understand it correctly?**  
 The beings who made those prophecies are above mortal human level, and they are speaking for their own understand. But many groups, entities are trying to decode simply do not have enough ability, do not understand it correctly even though with the “same” language like English, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, etc.  
 

It is similar to a question of what is cheap, what is expensive, or what is ugly, what is beauty.  
 It is all depends on each people situation and knowledge about life.  
 

Instead of just sitting, waiting and gambling about “the world savior”, you should wonder and askyour self question related to that prophecy world savior.  
 

**1. How the world savior will appear?**  
 **2. How the world savior will help mankind and save this civilization out of natural catastrophe disaster?**  
 

**1. There are only 2 possible answers: offline via personal or online internet.**  
 You should wonder and analyze the current situation in 2000s, all the textbook about how the world at end times 100 years ago or more are useless !  
 **- How many people even remember or know about the savior at the end time?**  
 The answer is that less than 0.1% of world popular for sure !  
 

**- Do the world savior need others to worship, to pray like many other deities?**  
 Many of you who are practicing rituals this that and have heavily influenced by traditional custom think that is need and necessary.  
 But the eternal truth is that no because everybody is equal, only the weak beings need others to pray to worship. You cannot die if you do not bow down or worship any entities, that is the way of human life.  
 

**- Have any divine religion teaching not via personal appearance?**  
 Yes, it is the Islam, and it is the last popular religion in top 5.  
 

**- What is the current world situation and what is the general mankind problem?**  
 If you do a poll and ask people about who you think will be the savior between: the one will give them 5 million dollar and the one can share the information about human to live to 500 years old, then you will know how “low” and “stupid” of the average humanity.  
 Most of humans only care and think about money and do not believe in eternal life, because they was not be taught!  
 So overall, it is lacked of knowledge and wisdom from the bottom to the top.  
 

**- So what is the best way to save humanity and educate the people?**  
 Must be through government policy and prize money competition with purpose of education if do not want chaos in life.  
 

**- What is the fastest way to transfer/send sacred information equal to all nations?**  
 The answer is via online internet.  
 

But the problem is that most elders, governments both in secret and public are only preparing the option number 1 via personal real life appear, but not via option 2 via online internet. How stupid are they ?!  
 

**2. There are many way to give better life for all, but the fastest way to educate people about life is using religion sacred textbooks. While if want to resolve problem about “money” paper, then it must come through laws, policy.**  
 

In some religions such as Islam, Buddhism have script talked about “revive” and bring their religion to the global world.  
 The fact is that all the religion purpose is for education, but not really to blind follow.  
 And the only answer can satisfy and “match” with all religion prophecies is “revive and make all religions better, easier to study, more attached with the people”.  
 

Based on pictures and news on the media, I can 100% sure that all of you have not yet discover and fully understand many divine teachings in all religions.  
 

You only understand about life base of mortal human level, but most the sacred textbook given by many thousand years old beings if not immortal. That why you never ever able to understand the true meaning of that book, unless you can able to “grow” like them.  
 

All kind of thinking like bring chaos will haste the world savior to come are truly stupid and wrong.  
 

Just like an accident lead to many death because of overcrowd in Mecca is because of “God Allah Act”, while the true reason is because of yourself, of human activities and decisions.  
 

Similar case to the world savior case, if you want to find who is the real world savior, just say it loud to the world, give massive contest and competition about new solutions to solve mankind problem and crisis. Maybe the being you are looking will come.  
 

Remember Gautama Buddha used to be normal mortal human like all of you, just like me, the only difference is that after “evolution” and archive the eternal nirvana infinite life truth of the universe.  
 

You live to save and grow yourself, you do not live to “save” the Earth planet school because you are too weak.  
 

Open your mouth and ask if you want to increase your knowledge and wisdom faster,stop all kind of “theories, conspiracy” thinking about the savior, about life without success, stop listening to all the “guru,spiritual teacher, etc”, because you live only one and you are have potential god ability in yourself.  
 

I do not know what you guys really waiting and looking for from me the World Savior, because I do not need to know. Life on Earth is too small compare the the Universe.  
 

I do not come here to claim any title or to save planet Earth because it can and always save itself.  
 I only come and still here to save your life, save your small personal world.

"A question about martyrs, resurrection, and warriors",lex_edge,1598824007,"Does martyrdom or the willing death of Christ against the passions have any correlation with philosophic warrior ethics? If warrior philosophy glorifies the aesthetic of beauty and truth of form but recognizes the imperfection of the natural body and physical world thereby identifying the release of pure beauty of the ideal body only in death then does this connect to Christian ideas of martyrdom? It seems that the resurrection and a martyr both, like the warrior, brave the swarms of passions and allow themselves to be taken but in a willful and orderly manner befitting logos and that by this self sacrifice of the body as a temple then the true resurrection body is released. I can't help but notice the similarity between this resignation to the false life and body's humility and the warriors perfection and glorification in death.",OrthodoxChristianity

Agnosticism to Christianity?,_pickledcarrotz,1598815881,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here I am.

I grew up in a Pentecostal church. I went to a Christian school and went to church at least three times a week. When I got older, I stopped believing and quit religion all together. I find it incredibly hard to believe in anything, but I really wish I could. My dad passed away two years ago and I really want to see him again someday - And I really want to believe that when I die, I’d get the opportunity to see him again.

A major sin after confession (not the usual questions...),IIIlllIIIlllIlIlII,1598815518,"4 days ago I went to (my 3rd) confession. I went to confess about my ongoing relationship with a close friend who is about to divorce her husband. I had (and still have) so much guilt over the things I’ve done. I truly love this woman (not just lust). 

Not even 2 days after that confession, she and I met and had a long talk...we both agreed to stay just as friends until she was fully divorced....the next day we met again just to talk and we ended up getting physical with each other. We did not have sex but to be vague it was a lot of kissing, grabbing, and groping. Since then I’ve had a panic attack and I have a constant rock in my stomach. Not even 2 days after my confession, I already messed up again. I can’t bring myself to face my spiritual father. I’m so ashamed of myself. I beg God for forgiveness and to strengthen me to fight these desires I have. I hate myself for these awful things that I’ve done. I know guilt and shame is what separates us from God but I can’t shake it anymore. I feel so awful about the things I’ve done. 

It also doesn’t help that my spiritual father made a comment to me last time that he was disappointed in me. I know I let him down but that really hurt to hear. I can’t bring myself to ask him for confession again. I’m so depressed and anxious after this whole ordeal. Im afraid that he’ll make me serve a penance and I’ll fail that too. I’m scared to face him again. Please pray for me (John) and my friend (Maria). I really need some insight on all of this, I don’t know what to do anymore.

Question on prayer ropes and the Jesus Prayer,SlavaIsusuChristu333,1598774147,"I am new to Eastern Christianity and am looking to obtain my first chotki.

If this is the most common, is it really difficult to keep track of the Jesus Prayer this way?  As a discipline, aren't Christians supposed to recite a certain number each day?  I know this is at the discretion of a spiritual director (but having read the way of a pilgrim, it seemed like this was how it was traditionally done).  Is that only a rule for monastics?  Or do all newcomers start with verbal recitation of x amount and then move up to double that and then triple that until they are so in sync with the prayer that they can recite it unceasingly?  I just question the 33 knot one because it's not a nice rounded number like the 50, 100, 150, etc.  Doesn't it make keeping track of the number of Jesus Prayers you recite difficult?

Translation of Deuteronomy 23,Shas-O-Drakonian,1598730266,"This is kinda a question for Bible scholars.

1""No man who crushes or cuts his penis shall enter the assembly of the Lord. 2""No one born of a forbidden marriage may enter the assembly of God, nor his descendants. 3""No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants may enter the assembly of God.

I think I was spiritually attacked last night. Any advice?,kikiki32,1598723017,"Hi. I’ve been coming back to God after many years trapped in heavy sinning. I’ve been getting migraine headaches for some years, which I’m used to deal with.

Yesterday I had a migraine. Nothing strange. I took a pill and went to bed at my usual time. But there, I started to experiment an intense anguish, a very intense regret for a very silly thing (a complete anecdote that just involves me and has no spiritual repercussion), fear of things about my job, my future and my relatives, a complete inability to pray, and a subtle temptation against the flesh that was constantly underlying. After that, I dreamt about situations that made me full of anguish. Not my best night. Today I’m slightly tired and my head still hurts a bit.

Usually, when I have a migraine and I’m tired, I get angry and don’t sleep very well. But tonight it was so different that I suspect it had some supernatural connotation (fear, anguish, inability to pray, temptation…). I’ve also increased my prayer life a little bit during last month and this comes just after I wasn’t able to pray like that for a couple of days… and the night before I go to vespers mass and receive the Holy Communion at a very little Church that only has a priest and doesn’t easily offer confession.

Talk big is easy, you think so?  
 Then you no absolutely nothing about life !  
 Why don’t you declare yourselves as the savior Messiah, Mahdi, Maitreya, Buddha, etc. to the world, just via online internet !  
 

Everything in life is connecting with each others.  
 Whenever any beings declare his/her-self as the savior, all kind of different beings from all realms will observe, checking and testing.  
 

The fake will vanish, the real will remain !  
 

Do you know I have post many hundreds different articles talk about life, bashing all kind of governments/nations for over last 2-3 years.  
 

Do you know that most nations are secretly managed by many higher advanced beings than normal mortal humans.  
 

I have declared myself as The Savior Messiah Mahdi Buddha anyname, not just because I think so.  
 But I did received a great sign from heaven nearly 3 years ago.  
 Not only that, I have fully know and understand the secret of life, the secret of immortals, the secret of human body.  
 

And that is the reasons keep me posting/sharing articles without receive any benefits, not a single donation button on many sites.  
 

Have you ever wonder what is the purpose of living?  
 If you do not seeking for immortal life, all kind of wealth are meaningless when you are die.  
 

Many of you will ask “prove” that fact.  
 I then asking you: following/listening to a out-of-nowhere beings who claim “know the immortal life” vs any groups/beings do not claim anything, which one will give you more chance to receive better result?  
 

Life is all about life or dead !  
 Continue to “worship”, to “pray” other beings cannot lead you to immortal life.  
 But only improve your knowledge/wisdom can lead you to heaven.  
 The real knowledge and wisdom cannot be understood via language, because they are just raw words theory.  
 Only via personal experience you can know the secret of life, the secret of tao.  
 

In the legendary Tao Te Ching book, the “tao” is the highest ranking above all kind “name” or in short are languages, numbers.  
 

**You must stop make a stupid bet and “following” any other secret organizations/groups, instead you must join me and listen to my words at forum freejoy.aimoo.com.**  
 

Only me able to withstand all kind of attack from all kind of beings from all realms.  
 Only me able to take full responsibility with the Earth administrators for all kind of policy apply to mortal humans.  
 

Life is short if you still not archive immortal,so why don’t you just “gambling” with a random guy like me via the internet. Beside me, do you see any beings/groups have big talk like this ?!  
 

Of course I am a real human but not a team or an AI computer.  
 Stop theory craft and take actions right now!  
 

Only me can lead you to heaven because only me know the secret correct way!  
 

**If You Want To Have A Better Eternal Life, You Must Seek Help &amp; Go Join The Savior’s World**  
 

Everybody is a “small” world.  
 Every nation is a “big” world.  
 And the Earth is the “class school” world.  
 But a world is always a world, just like a nation is always a nation no matter size.  
 

In reality, when your nation or your region in war and in chaos mode, what should you do?  
 Find till dead with no end sign or seek refugees in “better” other nations just like many people in Africa, Middle East are seeking free lunch in Europe.  
 

The truth of life is similar like that.  
 If you want to have a better life for yourself, you must either do it by yourself or following/listening to others. Because the Earth world you are living is too big that why many people was and in many secret societies/groups in hope for “better” life condition.  
 

And the word “better” meaning depend on each people ideology about human life.  
 

If you want to be like “God”, if you want to know the secret of immortality and the universe, the best chance and best opportunity in 2020 is to join the savior Messiah Buddha’s world.  
 But of course you cannot join directly, you can only join it indirectly at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com**.  
 

Many of you probably want “prove” this that.  
 I am telling this: talk big is not easy, provide life theory is very difficult.  
 If you think it is just an imagine everybody can do, then go ask any people who never have read or have any experience about any kind of fiction movies, novels to write story.  
 I can guarantee that no any of them able to write any fiction story !  
 

My world my society is the best, because it is free will free choice.  
 You can join and learn, but you do not have to receive and follow any “orders” like many current secret groups societies are doing.  
 

Theory is just a first step, the second step is you must test/verify by yourself.  
 If you only study, learn and remember words philosophy from other beings, then you are no good and in the wrong road.  
 

All kind of education degrees are useless and only “stupid sleepy” people want that.  
 

Only being who have obtained eternal life can give you the correct direction to the heaven.  
 

The eternal life is beyond words, beyond number and beyond all kind of languages you have known so far.

I attended Divine Liturgy for a while, about a year ago. I thought it was “beautiful” but did not take it seriously enough. 

Only after a year in my Baptist church have I become cognizant of what the Eucharist really is/means/does.

Now, I can’t see it any other way. And the layers keep getting peeled back the more I read/watch/pray.

My wife is a devout Baptist. All my friends are Baptist, or at least very Reformed thinkers, or Atheist.

I’ve been looking for the best way to go about exploring the church without ruining all my relationships.

I’ve sought counsel from Orthodox priests occasionally, and they have told me to take it slow and pray, be gracious to family members and friends, avoid comparison, tell them I’m only going “further, deeper.”

I think it’s been good so far, with only a couple hiccups, by the grace of God. In fact, my marriage has benefitted greatly with the help of church prayers - I read St. Gregory Palamas’ prayer for married couples almost every night with my wife, and we are happy.

Still, I feel I need more interaction with an Orthodox community to be grounded. I realized this the other day...

I was at dinner with two Reformed friends who were nitpicking little things I was saying in what was supposed to be a broad discussion of appreciation for our faith in Christ (they have some idea where I’m at). It was unspoken, but the tension was there.

It made me sick to my stomach. The feeling of discord makes me want to throw it away altogether, though in my heart of hearts I know what God has shown me to be true.

Basically, I need more Orthodox-minded friends (right now I have zero). Hard to make them in the time of Covid, so I thought I’d try reddit. 

Would love any encouragement, prayers, tips you could offer.

Thanks for reading.",OrthodoxChristianity

Marrying Roman Catholic- question about baptism for future kids,BazDim,1598628662,"Hello all. I’ve looked up this issue and have gotten very mixed conclusions; I understand that there’s little consensus on this but I thought I’d ask anyway.

I am marrying a Roman Catholic person, and we plan on having kids in the future. Regarding which church they would be baptized in, we’d both obviously rather they be baptized in our own respective churches but also love each other obviously and wish to accommodate the other. No matter how they are baptized we would teach them “both ways” (to put it crassly).

My question is, *if* they were baptized Roman Catholic, would the Greek Orthodox Church recognize it, and if the answer is “depends”, then what does it depend on? Also, is it possible for a child to be baptized twice, in both churches?

Giving Reasons for Monasticism to Protestants,ProfCChristian,1598565964,"Protestants are typically skeptical or even hostile towards monasticism, particularly of the hermetic variety (St. Antony of Egypt, St. Lazarus, etc.). Their claim is that Christ told us to be in this world, but not of it, and to evangelize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This cannot be done in an isolate mountain, forest, or desert.   


Yes, Christ spent 40 days and nights in the desert, but he returned to his ministry afterwards. Ditto for Paul. Protestants seem to have no problem with spending time alone to cultivate yourself for Christ, but stress that this is a temporary measure, not a permanent way of life.   


I love the Desert Fathers and other hermits, but I'm having trouble convincing Protestants that this is a useful endeavour, other than to suggest that they simply check out some of the Desert Fathers.",OrthodoxChristianity

"Being an Orthodox Christian in The US, Where people use “Protestant” and “Christian” as interchangeable terms",Very_Tall_Hobbit,1598564091,"So, I’m technically a convert, and was baptized in 2019 shortly before marrying into a Greek American/ Greek Orthodox Family. I say technically because it didn’t feel so much like a conversion as coming home, and is something I had already believed and been passionate about for a long time. I was raised Protestant, and grew up in a Southern state so the literal fundamentalist reading of scripture and complete conformity of personal beliefs and behavior was expected and enforced (also was raised in the Pentecostal tradition of Protestantism which is a whole other thing in itself). In many ways, that form of Christianity is more about American culture and ideals than about anything actually in scripture. How I discovered Orthodoxy and later converted is a long story, but it’s been life changing in a ton of ways. In the states, Protestantism (specifically this particular approach to Protestantism) is just called “Christianity”, and Orthodoxy is not even seen as Christianity if people know about it, which most don’t. A lot of American Protestants still hate Catholicism and see it as the enemy, but then have either no opinion or vague curiosity about Orthodoxy because they don’t know enough to have an opinion about it. American culture is super weird about religion in a lot of ways, and this is just one of them. All this to say, it sometimes is confusing to me, and often pretty frustrating, less so where I live in New York where there are a lot of Greek Orthodox parishes and Orthodox Christians so I am not alone and certainly not persecuted. I’m sharing this to see if there is anyone else who has had this kind of experience. I think the confusion I feel about this is probably just having grown up in a cultural majority religion and now being part of a minority one and it’s just a different experience than I’m used to, which might make talking about it here sound sort of entitled but that is totally not my intent.",OrthodoxChristianity

A big difference I'm aware of between Orthodoxy and (at least some) protestant churches is that while the protestants believe Christ died to pay for our sins, the Orthodox believe he simply died *for* our sins. What occurred to me is that we all call Christ ""Lamb of God"", as he is our Paschal Lamb, and we celebrate Pascha whenever we make Eucharist and receive communion. But these protestant churches are saying ""Paschal Lamb"" and yet basing their soteriology on the Scapegoat of Leviticus 16.

🔴 If You Think You’ve Disqualified Yourself From God’s Love ❌,The_Mission_Channel,1598549957,"✳️ Your Father saved you knowing full well about all the times that you would stumble. But did that stop Him? No, it didn’t. In fact, He sent His only son to pay the debt for all the times you would.
 
✳️ Of course, this doesn’t mean we can go around treating our Father’s love and mercy like a free credit card. But chances are, you genuinely want to be free from sin so you can  fully with Him. If that’s the case, then know that His arms are always open. And if you stumble, you can stumble forward into those arms. 
 
✳️ This is what our King, Jesus, had to say about those who stray from God: 
 
The Parable of the Lost Son
 
📖 Luke 15:11-24 
 
Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.
 
“Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. 
 
After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.
 
“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: 
 
Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’ So he got up and went to his father. 
 
“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.
 
“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’
 
“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.

How To Make Religions Better Easier For People To Study To Understand By The Savior,tank_steady,1598520347,"**How To Make Religions Better Easier For People To Study To Understand By The Savior**  
 

The religions was came in the past to teach people, to give people better direction in life, to give them hope about better future, better world.  
 

Nowadays the humanity is in the darkness again where people are instead of learning, studying, build up their knowledge to grow like God, they are chasing for illusion not important stuffs such as money, wealth, title, technology.  
 

It is the time to relive all religions, to unlock it full potential, because it is the best way to teach people about life, to help people get out of stupid conflict in life.  
 

All kind of war caused direct or indirect via religions because of humans simple do not understand the true meaning of those sacred teaching from the highest stand point.  
 

Some beings, groups, entities were trying to make religion conflict just want to people the do more research, to study more about religion, but mortal humans have limited memory storage.  
 

The complex complicated of each religion is beyond even their followers to fully understand it, let’s alone the outsiders.  
 

There are a lot of hidden teaching in many religions not yet brought to light.  
 **Examples:**  
 \- Why those monks in Buddhism need to shave all hair.  
 \- What is the human sin in Christianity, Jewish.  
 \- Why there is a Ramadan event every year in Islam.  
 etc.  
 

The religions have 2 part series, part 1 is blind follow and part 2 is critical thinking, deep learning and understand why do this action,why practice that activity.  
 

If you want to make it better,easier for the people to study, to understand, you must treat it like a big project. But instead of using money to make money, you are using money to make people to study religion more, to have a better life.  
 

**Here is an example how it should be done:**  
 **Step 1:** setup, form 2 or more version of your religion with different target people.  
 such as:Original vs Foreign, Old vs New, Short vs Long, Complicated vs Simplify, No explain vs Explanation, etc.  
 

**Step 2:** using various strategies to attach people to study to learn to understand your religion.  
 like: spend money to make competitions, challenge contest, to crazy thing like religion degree, etc.  
 

Here is to learn of why do this do that practice, not to worship pray or follow.  
 

The rich Arab Royal Families in the Middle East should spend money to explain others about the true pure Islam, they should not spend money for the useless football club.  
 The same go to the Jews, other royals, rich families.  
 

Above is a quick framework of how to make all religions better than ever for the people to easier learn, to study.  
 I am not get paid to do the detail job, so do not expect me to spend time and energy to help your religion for free, you guys must do by your own.  
 

If any beings, groups, entities want to have any discussion about the religions and other life matter, the only place I will answer is at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com**, but with very limited time to **September 15th** **2020**. After that date, I am off the internet and see the natural catastrophe to come !

Also some funky stuff in the Jesus section. I emailed one of my professors about this because she has a doctorate in the early church, and these were her thoughts on why this is (she's Orthodox actually; Romanian but goes to a Greek church now):

""Oh, the Creed has such a complicated history. The part about the Holy Spirit was added to the Nicene Creed at the Second Ecumenical Council in 381 (hence the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed). Since the acts of this council were lost, it is difficult to know exactly how this council unfolded, but one of the issues addressed there was the divine status of the Holy Spirit (just like Arius had claimed that the Son was a creature, some - called Pneumatomachians! - denied the divinity of the spirit). At Chalcedon there was some debate over what exactly Constantinople II did to the Nicene Creed, and whether that was appropriate, the conclusion being that it was perfectly appropriate because it clarified the Creed’s original intent. The one book I know on the Creed is J.N.D Kelly’s Early Christian Creeds (not the most sympathetic scholar when it comes to Orthodoxy, but overall a solid book).

The Armenians are part of the so-called Oriental Orthodox churches - miaphysite/monophysite churches. They rejected the Council of Chalcedon and eventually separated from the imperial Church. I am not sure about this one, but I would guess that since it was at Chalcedon that the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed was fixed once and for all, the Armenians could have deliberately reverted to an older formulation that was not associated with what they saw as a heretical council. But, of course, the main bone of contention with the rest of the Xian churches is not this credal formulation, but Christological belief - i.e., the one-nature Christology.""",OrthodoxChristianity

He does not partake.

But he has delight

In the law of the Lord God

Each day and each night.

In the Lord God's law,

The man, he shall meditate

By day and by night.

He is like the tree

Which is planted by the streams.

And he shall bear fruit

In the proper time.

In all things shall he prosper,

His leaf shall not fall.

The wicked, not so;

They are like the chaff, scattered

By the wind from earth.

The wicked won't stand,

They won't rise in judgement,

Nor will the sinner.

With the righteous ones

He won't stand in their council,

The upright council.

It hurts I need a prayer,WhatonEarthss,1598481461,"Hey everyone, I began talking to this girl for 5 months and we were building a great relationship and everything, and suddenly she went cold and wasn't as receptive as she used to be. I haven't heard from her in a month, she told me that things were going on in her life and we basically went our seperate ways i guess. No bad blood between us I don't think.

Its just Im in so much pain, I honestly became a better Christian Orthodox when I was with her because I was just so greatful to have someone so amazing in my life, I left behind so many vices such as alcohol and weed when I was with her, and honestly it was just the best time of my life, doing my Orthodox prayers every night and everything. Since shes been gone for the month I still try to maintain these healthy habits, but its like theres a hole in my heart, and some doubt. Why would God show me someone so great, someone that we had plans together, and then just take her out of my life. 

I feel like I'm in so much pain, I don't even think I can begin to conceptualize the pain im going through, and I even had a mental breakdown. Ive been through tough things, its just I can't find comfort no matter what I do. I know God is with me, but why is he making me suffer like this. I can't meet new people due to the quarantine, and honestly maybe I made mistakes to push her away. Im trying my best to be good and not fall into vices but its just so hard because I miss her so much. 

I need some advice and prayers if possible, prayers to get myself back on track, prayers to get this girl back into my life. and advice in general on how to deal with this feeling of hardship, and why I am being punished if I was doing good, and trying to hang the past wrongs that I've done before I met her.",OrthodoxChristianity

Orthodox View on Feminism,scientific_orangutan,1598480781,"I don’t intend to ruffle any feathers here, though I expect that will happen. Rather, my intention here is to seek a consistent Orthodox position towards feminism.

For the purposes of definition, let’s assume that feminism means something like, “men and women should be equal in most ways, including employment, pay, family roles, and dignity.”

My prior is that although women should certainly have equal dignity and rights, including the right to vote, their creation by God has been for purposes other than those of men. Therefore, one cannot be a practicing Orthodox Christian and a feminist.

Is this hymn text orthodox?,Ra-zis,1598466815,"What do you think, is this text orthodox? The first two verses in this recording are from the pen of the non-conformist Puritan hymnographer Isaac Watts, and verse 3 is from a doxology that appears in two different hymns written by Thomas Ken in 1674.

The tune here is Old 100th, the same tune to which choirs often sign ""All People That on Earth Do Dwell"", which is a metrical version of Psalm 100 from the Anglo-Genevan Psalter of 1561. That explains why this Catholic recording caught my ear as I was listening to YouTube music on autoplay. I knew I'd heard this tune somewhere before.

I don't know why, but it's fascinating to come across an apparently orthodox text by a dissenter from my mother's spiritual tradition. Isaac Watts seems pretty sound from what I know of him so far, although obviously he was Protestant.

My mother was raised in the a congregation from the Northern Baptist Convention — not to be confused in any way with the Southern Baptist Convention, which broke away from the Triennial Convention in 1845 over the issue of slavery. The first Baptist church in America was founded by Roger Williams in 1638. He was an abolitionist, and launched the first organized effort to abolish slavery in North America.

Protestants and their schisms upon schisms, eh? God love 'em, they often get things right. There's a part of me that's very hungry to find whatever fragments of Orthodoxy exist within my mongrel American family's dissenting traditions. My brothers and I are of Anglo-Scots-Irish-Quebecois heritage. It's hard to explain. I guess I want to get some of my Orthodoxy from the West.

✳️ Calm seas don’t make good sailors. But when the waters get a little deep, trust Him who walked on it. He will not let you sink- He is your lifeguard. 

✳️ The future may look uncertain, but never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God. After all, fear only arises when we imagine that everything depends on us. 

✳️ You are no longer a slave to fear. It’s a liar. You have not been given a spirit of fear, but of love, power, and of a sound mind. Your Father has led you through all your past trials, and He won’t stop now. You have a mission- run your race without hesitation. Run it like there’s no tomorrow. And pretty soon, you’ll find that the only fear you have in your life is the godly fear of the Lord Himself.

The exclusivity of salvation,NimeniOnPunainen,1598348367,"I am asking here as I prepare to go to a Church and nudge a sleeve of a priest the next weekend, hopefully initiating a conversation I've tried to have for years without satisfactory answers. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, the gospels. At one point my heart rejoices. Then questions, confusement. I can deal with those. It seems like most parts have things sticking out of them that hurt my head. At one point I rejoice, feel like I might understand the tiniest bit - then it feels like it's a foreign entity speaking. Which is, understandable, I suppose, since I am not God but very human indeed.

I could deal with Jesus treating a woman from Canaan like a racist - maybe that's the angle of Matthew telling the story or something. And so forth. I could put them in the ""maybe later I'll understand, once I've read this more and prayed more""-folder. 

But, it seems like I can't, when it comes to exclusivity of salvation. It breaks my heart. While it certainly makes me one of the doomed ones with my false love for a saviour I do not know, suspiciously lukewarm regret over my sins, opportunistic, fear-based reaching for the absolute in hopes to ease the crippling horror over the end of consciousness that's laid waste on my life since early childhood (pardon this angsty venting, I do know such hopelessness are Satan's whispers, I pray for salvation and believe that I will be saved according to the promise despite my worse moral character than many of those who do not pass the criteria, one of allegiance that seems somewhat feudal like) - well, it's just that you take millions upon millions of people with souls and consciousnesses, allow them to live for the briefest of cosmic blink of an eye, then torture them for ETERNITY: That is, torture without an end. I feel like heaven is not heaven if this is going on elsewhere.

I want to vomit these thoughts out instead of suppressing them, with knowledge that despite my pain over this matter, I'll always be Christ's hopeless lover. Universalist viewpoints carried me for a while, but Jesus' all too clear words manage to flatter these hopes each time. I rejoiced when it dawned me that maybe in the parable of the field where good and bad fields are sowed, we would be the earth instead of the wheat - that we would be purified and the good collected.

Then he hammers home that Satan raises bad people and they will be burned. My heart sank. I kept praying - but it was weeble pleas for an horror and awe-inspiring ancient, impenetrable judge in the face of abject terror, not gentle communication with an all-loving entity. 

Well, mostly it is still the latter, but that requires me to suppress a lot of what I've just read on the gospels.

The stuff about everyone getting called and getting an equal chance in the grand scale of things never rung me as anything but hollow. It feels a bit like \*\*\*\* you, got mine-mentality. Pardon if that doesn't make sense.

That being said, I am done with rebelling. There is no other path for me than Christ. I hope I won't be swallowing tears and confusion all my life. In parts, I was provocative. Of this, I am sorry - I am merely trying to find answers, and I will be thankful for any provided.",OrthodoxChristianity
Newbie Questions,YioUio,1598345949," *\[Forgive me for my English\]*

It  doesn't matter what I'm learning about I'm always full of questions,  sometimes it helps to understand the matter, sometimes it hinders the  process.

Recently, I start to  learn more about Orthodox Christianity, even though I had almost  everything I desired in a material sense, still felt lost and full of  questions about life.

Every day I remember sins I did, or sins I continue doing now, it like changing my ""world-view lenses"".

I have several questions which I think about recently.

**What are we after death?**

We  can't have most of feelings and sensations we have now, since most of  them (if not all of them) are deeply connected to our human body, they  are build using hormones our body have, so most of our current feelings  can't be transferred to the ""afterlife"".

What part of ourselves will move to the ""afterlife""? will we have our memories?

I  know I'm measuring things with ""Earthy metrics"", trying to understand  transcend things with ""Earthy mind"", but hopefully you understand what  I'm asking.

**Am I egoistic?**

I  love my parents and my siblings more than myself, I would change my  life for my brother, I would do the same for my parents but that would  be even more painful for them. So, during this life we all have our own  journey, we can help other towards the right way but can't force anyone,  I'm full of sins, how can I teach to my brother or friends what and why  they should do?!

So, my second  question is, how can I be happy(or another afterlife feeling) without  people I love in this life (assuming we don't end up in the same place)  and isn't this egoistical to be ""happy"" without your ""earthy brother""?

**What about people with different religions?**

Not  everyone is lucky enough to born in Orthodox country or find it in  their journey, but there are many people around the world, maybe  atheists, Muslims, Buddhists, etc. who believe things their ancestors  teach them, what if they are kind, helpful, humble, doing right things,  etc. how God will judge them?

Many deep questions from a Lutheran considering Orthodoxy,EmptyPudding777,1598344266,"I have been recently intrigued by Orthodoxy (as I have been in the past). However, I never really gave Orthodoxy a chance - when I couldn't understand a topic properly, I became frustrated and just gave up, or I understood it and thought it was wrong. But now, I have an open mind. I have a few questions that I need to know the answers to. Sorry if it's a bit long. 


1. **Is Salvation by Faith or Works?** I always hear Orthodox say we cannot merit salvation, but at the same time they maintain we *must* do works to be saved. So my question is, are we saved by Faith alone, by faith+works, or are works a subsection of faith? 


2. **How can the Orthodox say that Holy Communion is a sacrifice to God?** My understanding (the Lutheran understanding) is that it's not a sacrifice, but rather, a Gift from God. How can there be one sacrifice for sins (as Hebrews 10:12 says) and yet, there could be another sacrifice in the Eucharist?


3. **Salvation = Sanctification?** I look at the Orthodox view of salvation and find that salvation is *theosis*, that is, becoming more and more like God everyday. To me, this seems like a confusion between justification and sanctification, justification being that we are forgiven for Christ's sake, and Sanctification that we are enabled by the Spirit to become more Christ like. For me, I don't understand how salvation can be Theosis, as my western-influenced theology would hold salvation is to be with God for eternity. So how is salvation *theosis*, and where does it fit into the atonement?


4. **How did Jesus save us?** I've heard the Orthodox mostly subscribe to *Christus Victor* rather than the Atonement theory. Some even say that Christ's blood didn't save us (contrary to Scripture), but rather, His death showed us the way of salvation, and in it He defeated death, and that He didn't die as a satisfaction for sins, but rather, He died so we may live. So what is the Orthodox atonement theory? Christus Victor? Ransom Theory? All of them?


5. **Why do Orthodox fast?** Coming from a Reformed Background, I really never learned to fast and don't know how to. But my question is, why? Why do Orthodox fast so often?


6. I have a plethora of questions that I need answered, but I don't want to write a rant, so here's a few others.


- Why do Orthodox ask the saints to pray for them and venerate icons?


- Do Orthodox hold that Baptism as an assurance of salvation? Does Baptism save in Orthodox theology?


- How is Mary the Queen of Heaven and Earth, and what does she do? How do we know this event even happened?


- Where can I find Orthodox books? I have a hard time finding resources.

"Christian People Do Not Understand Correctly About Jesus’s Teaching, Here Is The Eternal Truth",fifth_average,1598320887,"**Christian People Do Not Understand Correctly About Jesus’s Teaching, Here Is The Eternal Truth**  
 

Jesus is not the savior Messiah, because I am the only real savior Messiah.  
 That is why I am here to clarify what is “wrong” and “correct” from Jesus’s teaching.  
 Whether he did it on purpose or his knowledge was limited, I do not debate do not care.  
 

The most value thing Jesus did bring to the Christianity was bringing hope about a better future, better world.  
 

He said people should devote, pray worship God.  
 But what is exactly that mean?  
 

First, you need to understand what is God which Jesus did refer?  
 Secondly, you need to understand is devote, pray worship truly mean?  
 

Of course everybody have their own understand about the meaning of the word, just like to some people a luxury car is cheap, but too most people they are very expensive.  
 That is why the higher understanding about the meaning of words from the higher stand point the better.  
 

I am the real savior Messiah, and I am going to give you my knowledge, whether you believe it or not, it is up to you.  
 

**The God here is the human’s Creator.**  
 If you ask what is the difference, then I can tell you this God and all of you are having the same body structure. The only difference is that God have higher level of knowledge and wisdom, while you guys do not.  
 

**What is devote pray worship truly mean?**  
 It is learning, studying and understanding about life, grow up like God.  
 And the life here is everything about Earth planet and the Universe environment. It is not just eat work sleep routine.  
 

The term “sacrifice and burn” is just a small subject.  
 God do not recommend you burn and give anything, but what he really wanted you to burn are those stuffs not important and unused. Because those stuffs are blocking the flow of life energy.  
 If you look at the Eastern, you will notice they have burning paper ritual !  
 

It is the process from the Infinite Energy Of Life to Human to back.  
 

I can tell you the best ritual of modern era is burning all those stupid plastic clothes, chair, unused stuffs. Not animals nor human beings.  
 You will get richer, and have better chance of winning lottery number for sure !  
 

And if you want to really understand about life, you should learn more about other religion teaching as well, that is a tough road.  
 

If you want a quicker road, and want really understand whatever kind of Jesus’s teaching, I can explain to you but only when you guys asking at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com**, time limited to September 15th 2020.  
 

This is a quick article gift for the Christianity.  
 Jesus won’t appear in public affair and comeback, there are many thousand beings have the level similar and above him are residing on Earth in many jungle mountain.  
 

You do not just learn to follow the order, but you must learn why you doing it. If you only do but not truly understanding it correctly, then you are doing the wrong thing !  
 

The ultimate purpose of all teaching is you must learn, study and grow like God !  
 

Best Regard,  
 **The Savior Messiah**

For almost a year now, I have been going through a very difficult time, at times having panic attacks, mostly stemming from a traumatic event involving loss of friends and reputation, and have been having a very difficult time coping with my guilt and regret over certain past actions and behaviors. At times I feel there is no hope. For around 6 months I have become interested in the orthodox church, I wa raised protestant but fell away from the faith as a teenager. When I decided I believed in and needed god, after doing some research and searching, the eastern orthodox tradition feels the most authentic and spiritual for me. So, anyway, I am looking for an orthodox-centered book that deals with getting through a tough time, overcoming guilt and regret, and redemption. There are a great many books on this subject from a protestant perspective, but most of them seem ""self help"" oriented, and possibly more geared towards women. (I am a 25 year old guy.)

If other baptisms are valid then we are doing a great injustice by rebaptising those individuals and we may be practicing a form of donatism. Either way I cannot reconcile the two views either way there is some abuse and this dispute is a great scandal to our faith. 

If anyone could help me work through this aspect of our faith it would be much appreciated .

Is there a way to tell if God wants you to be single for life?,Nationalist_Republic,1598238165,"Tldr: Is there a way to tell if God wants you to be single for life?

Understanding: 
The phrase ""have faith"" doesn't help because when God said to Abraham that he'd have a kid that meant he WILL have a kid, have faith and wait. I can't have faith for something that may or may not have been predetermined to not happen. 
I know sometimes it's just a matter of time, for example my parents married when they were 35.


Reasoning: when people want to become a doctor or a member of some other profession they don't just become it. They work for it and take classes to learn. If you want something you work your way so that you will be able to acquire what you want. 

So that's what I've been doing. 
I've been saving money my whole life so I can start a family one day (currently I'm 22)
I've been losing weight to become healthy. 
And I've been working on my mental disorders.

I want God or some saint to come down and tell me to either continue or to stop wasting my time. 

If they tell me to stop wasting my time then I'll be able to use even more money to tithe and to donate. If God has pre determined that I'm supposed to be alone I want/need to know so I can stop wasting my life preparing for something that won't come. 

The answer ""you're still young"" doesn't help because that doesn't answer my questions or put my mind at ease as they said I was still young at 16 and I've never had a first date let alone a single relationship.

Repent For The Kingdom of Heaven Is At Hand,UncreatedLightPress,1598227727,"Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,

What we are currently witnessing throughout the world cannot be described in any other way, then a direct demonic attack upon the Church of Christ and upon Christ Himself. Have we become so depraved as humans and so sinful that we dare to attack Christ Himself; our Creator, our Savior, and our God. Have we no shame? Have we no conscience? Have we no fear of the world to come, and the torments that await the goats on the left-hand side? How faithless have we become if we question the very basis of our Orthodox Faith? If we have grown to fear the Body and Blood of Christ; not as the Holy Fathers did out of awe and love for Christ, but rather out of anxiety and paranoia. Are we concerned that Christ Himself might become defiled through the use of a single spoon? That creation will infect the Creator? Have you not heard what Saint John Chrysostom, who’s Divine Liturgy we celebrate every Sunday, has to say about the Body and Blood of Christ? “When you see the Lord immolated and lying upon the altar, and the priest bent over that Sacrifice praying, and all the people empurpled by that Precious Blood, can you think that you are still among men and on earth? Or are you not lifted up to heaven?” When the Divine Liturgy begins we do not metaphorically unite Heaven and earth, but rather the two truly and in actuality come together as one. Why then should we fear an earthly virus if we have come into contact with the eternal? Why are we more afraid of this virus, than we are of our sins? Do not our sins affect our lives far more than this virus ever can? What is more dangerous, a disease that can cripple the flesh or a disease that can cripple the soul? Again, look at what Saint Gregory of Nyssa has to say in his Great Catechism, “In the plan of His grace He spreads Himself to every believer by means of that Flesh, the substance of which is from wine and bread, blending Himself with the bodies of believers, so that by this union with the Immortal, man, too, may become a participant in incorruption. These things He bestows through the power of the blessing which transforms the nature of the visible things to that \[of the Immortal\].” Holy Communion is not a source of corruption, but rather of incorruption. It is not a source of infection, but rather of healing. How can we, corrupt and spiritually-diseased ones, point at Him Who is Incorrupt and state that He is the cause of our sickness? He is not to blame; we are! By questioning the Holy Eucharist, one questions Christ Himself in the same way Pilot questioned him 2000 years ago. Whomever goes against the Holy Communion, goes against Christ. And whoever goes against Christ, cannot truly love Christ. Have we forgotten what the Holy and Glorious Apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians in his first epistle, “If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed (1 Corinthians 16:22). Brothers and sisters in Christ, I plead with you do not fall for the temptations of this world and of the evil one. If your faith has been shaken in the past few months, run ever more fervently to Christ and beg for strength and forgiveness. If you have let worldly knowledge take priority over what the Church teaches, run ever more fervently to Christ and beg for Him to illumine your mind. If you have grown paralyzed with fear and anxiety, run ever more fervently to Christ and beg for the fear of God. There is no doubt that we are approaching the end, whether the end is tomorrow or in another 2000 years, nobody knows. But one thing remains just as true today as it was during the times of Christ, “Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”

What are we after this human life? [several QUESTIONs],YioUio,1598220774,"*\[Forgive me for bad my English\]*  
It doesn't matter what I'm learning about I'm always full of questions, sometimes it helps to understand the matter, sometimes it's hinders the process.  
Recently, I start learn more about orthodox christianity, since even though I had almost everything I desired in material sense, still felt lost and full of questions about the life.

Every day I remember sins I did, or sins I continue doing now, it like changing my ""world-view lenses"".  
I have several questions which I think about recently.

&amp;#x200B;

**What are we after the death?** 

We can't have most of feelings and sensetions we have now, since most of them (if not all of them) are deeply connected to our human body, they are build using hormones our body have, so most of our current feelings can't be transfered to the ""after life"".

What part of ourself will move to the ""after life""? will we have our memories? 

I know I'm measuring things with ""Earthy metrics"", trying to understand transcend things with ""Earthy mind"",  but hopefully you understand what I'm asking.  


**Am I egoistic?**  
I love my parents and my siblings more than myself, I would change my life for my brother, I would do same for my parents but that would be even more painful for them. So, during this life we all have our own journy, we can help other towards the right way but can't force anyone, I'm full of sins, how can I teach to my brother or friends what and why they should do?!

So, my second question is, how can I be happy(or other afterlife feeling) without people I love in this life (assuming we don't end up in same place) and isn't this egoistical to be ""happy"" without your ""earthy brother""?

&amp;#x200B;

**What about people with different religions?**

Not everyone is lucky enough to born in Orthodox country or find it in their journey, but there are many people around the world, maybe atheists, muslims, budists, etc. who beleive things their ancestors teach them, what if they are kind, helpful, humble, doing right things, etc. how god will judge them?",OrthodoxChristianity

What are Orthodox views on extemporaneous prayer?,oncomingstorm777,1598213850,"Hi everyone, I've been wondering about this for a while now and was hoping to hear from some other's perspectives. 

For context, I am of Protestant background (initially Methodist, more recently evangelical non-denominational) . My girlfriend is Orthodox and was raised that way, and as we have developed a serious relationship, I have been inquiring into the Orthodox Church since around the beginning of this year. 

My question is about the use of extemporaneous/freeform/non-liturgical/non-written prayer (I don't know of an exact terminology) among Orthodox Christians. From my background, this type of prayer is certainly the most predominant form. In my experience, the general structure is something along the lines of 1) Dear Father (or Dear God).... 2) Stating concerns/requests/things we are thankful for/etc. 3) ... in Jesus' name, Amen. In my admittedly limited experience of Orthodoxy, I have not really seen much of this type of prayer. 

I want to be clear that I have no issues with reading prayers that have been previously written. They can be incredibly powerful and poignant. The services of the Church are filled with these types of prayers, and I find them incredibly moving and timeless. I am wondering about utilizing freeform prayer alongside that.

During a recent conversation with my girlfriend about building our faith based practices as a couple outside of church, we were talking about incorporating more dedicated time for prayer together. We typically pray before meals with the Lord's prayer, or on occasion, she will offer another Orthodox written prayer. It was interesting to me when my girlfriend mentioned that she basically had no experience with the kind of prayer that I mentioned above. I guess my personal perspective was that when I am ""praying for someone"" it means that I'm bringing them up and their specific situation to God directly, which seems like it would be hard to do from something pre-written. (Again, not saying any other way is wrong...just speaking from my own experience!)

TL;DR - If I had to summarize my questions: Is extemporaneous prayer something that is commonly used by Orthodox Christians? If not common, is it at least something seen as acceptable?

A couple of Church Organization questions,plazman30,1598197161,"As a Catholic, some of our Church structure mirrors Orthodox structure, but not completely.  So, please tell me if I have any of this wrong.

In the Orthodox Church, there are only 3 ecclesiastic levels for clergy: deacons, priests and bishops.  Each subsequent level has ecclesiastical authority over the level below it.  There is no ecclesiastical level higher than a bishop.

On the administrative side, we have archbishops, metropolitans, and patriarchs.  ALL of these are just bishops, but they have a greater geographic area they are responsible for.  These titles are granted to bishops out of respect and because they have shown they can handle the additional administrative duties required of the title.

Do I have most of that correct?

If so, I'm curious how disciplinary actions within the Church work?  Can a bishop or groups of bishops declare a Patriarch excommunicated, or does the Patriarch of another church have to do that?  Can a bishop of one church excommunicate a member of another church, or is that not done out of tradition?  If they excommunicate a member of another church, are they excommunicated from ALL Orthodox Churches?  Can there be excommunication pissing matches where one bishop excommunicates someone and another bishop the restores them to full communion?

Now, I'm sure, out of respect, members of one church will contact another church and request that someone be excommunicated, defrocked or anathemize'd and show evidence, rather than take actions on their own.  I find that the decentralized Orthodox model is usually rather polite and respectful.  But I'm curious if this is tradition, rather than hard requirement.

I was curious about the orthodox view on end times and the recreation of the heavens and the Earth. Mainly looking for a summary or unified belief on how everything will happen.

How does guidance of the spirit work?,BOT_Kieran2,1598192293,"This is a question I've had for a while, but I am struggling to understand exactly how the spirit guides a believer.

The backbone of patristics is the idea that because they were holy, they obviously were following the guidance of the spirit and because they've been guided by the spirit, their biblical exegesis and spiritual knowledge will be close to the truth revealed by the spirit.

This sounds like it would make sense but when getting into specifics it seems contradictory in many ways.

St Isaac for example argues that God is not retributive in his acts and that this is blasphemous thought, and argues that it is not fitting of God to hand over rational beings to eternal torment.

Now obviously, there's a lot of saints who would say otherwise and would assert their own beliefs as the direct experience of the spirit and Orthodoxy.

So theres a quite obvious contradiction, the spirit cannot be guiding them into a single universal truth if they come to mutually exclusive belief systems. If we believe that there is one spirit and one truth, how would they come to such radically different beliefs about Gods nature and acts?

The simple answer would be that they weren't being guided by a spirit at all, but just coming to beliefs like any other human, but that would obviously be far too reductive for a Orthodox Christian to believe.

What is the solution to this problem?",OrthodoxChristianity

Change is the Orthodox Understanding of the intermediate state of the dead between salvation and damnation (what Catholics believe in as purgatory)?,athumbhat,1598146059,"On the one hand Saint Mark of Ephesus, contesting the latin view of purgatory, taught 

&gt; All such ones, we affirm, are helped by the prayers and Liturgies performed for them, with the cooperation of the Divine goodness and love for mankind. This Divine cooperation immediately disdains and remits some sins, those committed out of human weakness, as Dionysius the Great (the Areopagite) says in 'Reflections on the Mystery of Those Reposed in Faith' (In 'The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, 7, 7); while other sins, after a certain time, by righteous judgments it either likewise releases and forgives--and that completely--or lightens the responsibility for them until that final judgment. And therefore we see no necessity whatever for any other punishment or for a cleansing fire; for some are cleansed by fear, while others are devoured by gnawings of conscience with more torment than any fire, and still **others are cleansed only the the very terror before the Divine Glory and the uncertainty as to what the future will be...**

&gt; And so, we intreat God and believe to deliver the departed from (eternal torment), and not from any other torment or fire apart from those torments and that fire which have been proclaimed to be forever. And that, moreover, **the souls of the departed are delivered by prayers from confinement in [hades]**, as if from a certain prison, is testified, among many others, by Theophanes the Confessor, called the Branded. ...In one of the canons for the reposed he thus prays for them: 'Deliver, O Savior, Thy slaves who are in the [hades] of tears and sighing' (Octoechos, Saturday canon for the deposed, Tone 8, Canticle 6, Glory). - St. Mark of Ephesus, First Homily on the Refutation of the Latin Chapters Concerning Purgatorial Fire

on the other hand, the Confession of Dosithius, accepted by the entire Orthodox Church at the time, in dealing with the claims of Calvinism, teaches:

&gt; And the souls of those involved in mortal sins, who have not departed in despair but while still living in the body, though without bringing forth any fruits of repentance, have repented — by pouring forth tears, by kneeling while watching in prayers, by afflicting themselves, by relieving the poor, and finally by showing forth by their works their love towards God and their neighbor, and which the Catholic Church has from the beginning rightly called satisfaction — [their souls] depart into Hades, and there endure the punishment due to the sins they have committed. **But they are aware of their future release from there**, and are delivered by the Supreme Goodness, through the prayers of the Priests, and the good works which the relatives of each do for their Departed; especially the unbloody Sacrifice benefiting the most; which each offers particularly for his relatives that have fallen asleep, and which the Catholic and Apostolic Church offers daily for all alike. Of course, it is understood that we do not know the time of their release. We know and believe that there is deliverance for such from their direful condition, and that before the common resurrection and judgment, but when we know not.

Now, the confession does not specifically state that the dead cannot pray for themselves, but it does not mention that they can either.

On the issue of whether or not those in the intermediate state know of their future release into heaven, there seems to be a contradiction, and I have seen catholic claims that this contradiction proves that Orthodoxy has changed its view, especially in light of the fact that both these teachings were in fact accepted by the church as a whole, or at least the vast majority of the church at the time.",OrthodoxChristianity

The imagination has such a strong influence over mankind that we are warned by numerous Fathers of the Church to reject the images of dreams and scorn fantasies of the imagination in favor of what the Philokalic Fathers call ""pure intellections,"" that is, abstract thinking free of images

St. Hesychios of Jerusalem writes in the first volume of the Philokalia, ""When there are no fantasies or mental images in the heart, the intellect is established in its true nature, ready to contemplate whatever is full of delight, spiritual, and close to God "" (On Watchfulness and Holiness, #93). Here St. Hesychios is reflecting the patristic teaching that man, prior to his fall, had no use for imagination or fantasy. Imagination as we know it is a product of the fall.

How to explain Christian morality and ethics?,mahaanus,1598132844,"I'm not bad with human-to-human communication, but I'm not great either. My skills...could be described as casual. Which is why I don't attempt to convert people - I know I won't succeed and frankly I will do more harm, than good if I try. So I am not asking on how to convert people, that, I know, is beyond me. 

What I am asking is how to explain to someone Christian morality and ethics. Recently I got into conversation with a friend of mine (non-Christian, parents are atheists) about some of the things that were currently going in pop-culture and my disapproval of them.

He didn't get it. To him morality is what people agreed upon and if people changed their mind, that's what the new morality is. That's the end of it. The old things are old and don't matter, things are changing and whatever the new normal is, is the new normal. 

I'm not asking on how to get back to him with that conversation, the two of us are not going back to that topic. What concerns me is that as society becomes more and more atheistic, the less of the Christian ethics and morality we take for granted will be taken for granted.

What do you do when you struggle/lament a sin after having confessed it and are taking active steps to not sin this way again? 

The sin I am struggling with is having hurt someone very dear to my heart: my father and I do not share religious beliefs, and for almost two years leading up to my conversion to Christianity I slowly tried to share my faith with him. These conversations were hard and I could have been immensely more selfless and loving to him than I was. I am fervently praying for and working toward the restoration of our relationship as much as God will permit. I have confessed how I believe I have sinned against my father, however our relationship is still broken and I am reminded of my sin against him whenever I think of him. I know Jesus has forgiven me, in my heart, but I still ache when I see how I have hurt my father.

How to confess a specific sin? I could also use some insight... [NSFW],IIIlllIIIlllIlIlII,1598073026,"First off, I plan to ask my priest for confession tomorrow night. Please do not judge me for my sins that I’m mentioning in this thread. Please pray for me and my friend. We both regret our actions and are looking to truly repent. Please pray for “Maria” and I that we may strengthen ourselves in the faith. 

Second, I’m unsure of how to confess a specific sin...I’ve had a semi-romantic relationship with a close friend who is on the verge of divorce (not married in the church). She and I care for each other a lot and I would say we have love for each other. However, we have had sexual relations and we’re both deeply ashamed for acting so impulsive. I have no desire to continue the sexual part of our friendship/relationship and she doesn’t have the desire either. Part of me feels like I shouldn’t be her friend anymore but the strangest part about all of this is that she has encouraged me greatly to go to confession. She sees the pain I’ve been in and pushes me more into my faith. Part of me feels like that’s a good reason to keep our friendship and another part of me feels like I’m crossing the line by staying friends with her. 

With that said, since I’m not married but she is, did I technically commit adultery? How exactly should I word it when I confess this? I feel like saying “I had sex with a friend” isn’t confessing fully. Any and all insight is greatly appreciated. God bless all of you!",OrthodoxChristianity

"Patriarch Kirill urged believers to prepare for their ""own"" end of the world",radonezh,1598034402,"
In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit!

“And the sun and the moon will be darkened, and the stars will fall from heaven, and then the Son of Man will appear, coming in a cloud in His glory” (see Matthew 24: 29-30). We have heard such mysterious, even terrible words today in the Gospel during the Divine Liturgy.

Of course, these words are about the end of the world, which will be associated with an incredible cosmic cataclysm. Indeed, what must happen for the sun to darken, so that the moon no longer reflects sunlight, so that the stars disappear? It is enough to look into the starry sky in clear weather on a dark night to understand all the greatness of divine creation, the entire gigantic scale of space. The Apostle, not on his own, but moved by the Holy Spirit, says: ""The sun will darken, the moon will not give light, the stars will fall from heaven, and then the Son of God will appear in glory with angels.""

We are talking about the end of human history, about the second terrible and glorious Coming of the Lord and Savior. Probably, there is no other topic that would excite an Orthodox person so much, and as a pastor, literally from a young age, from the very beginning of my priestly ministry, I had many times, in different audiences, and among a narrow circle of people who are familiar and close to me, and in a wider circle to answer the themes of the end of the world, the end of the universe. Because no matter how people who are far from faith look at this text, it amazes with its cosmic drama. “Well, what if it really happens like this? God knows why it is written in the Holy Scripture, ”say people who doubt. Well, we know for sure that everything will happen that way, so the theme of the end of the world affects people very much.

As I said, I often had to talk about this topic, and as I became convinced that the end of the world is one of the most important, perhaps those that worry people, I got this idea. Of course, a person cannot be reasonable if he does not think about the end, about the universal end. But much closer to us is not that cosmic end of the Universe, but our own end of the world!

Sometimes, worrying too much about how this will happen to the human race, we forget that before all this, much earlier, we will have our own end of the world. Therefore, for an Orthodox person, with all his interest in the distant cosmic perspective of the universe, the question of his own end of the world should be more conscious and more urgent. When will it end for us here on earth? What will happen to us then? After all, there is also a meeting!

And the question arises: who will this meeting be with? With the Lord coming to the cloud with His angels, or with a dark and terrible power, which is also really present in human history, in the human race, and simply in our life? Everyone knows how easily he succumbs to temptations, to temptations; how, sometimes going against his conscience, against his nature, he commits sin and lawlessness. With this baggage we will appear - not when the cosmos completes its physical existence, but when one of the organs of our physical body, called the heart, simply stops beating. No cosmic tragedy, no cosmic dimension, but for us this death will turn out to be greater than any cosmic cataclysm. We will cease to be here in this world, with its joys and sorrows, with its ups and downs, with our ups and downs, and then, what today seems to us to be of paramount importance, priority, at that moment will disappear from our gaze, in general from our consciousness. Perhaps, looking at our earthly life from a new position, we will say: My God, what have we been doing! What did we waste our time on! Why did we fight so hard, why did we enter into conflicts with people, why did we destroy our own families, why did we deceive our relatives and friends, not to mention strangers and distant ones? Well, why all this ?! But these questions will hang - neither we, nor anyone else will be able to answer them. Why did they deceive relatives and friends, not to mention strangers and distant ones? Well, why all this ?! But these questions will hang - neither we, nor anyone else will be able to answer them. Why did they deceive relatives and friends, not to mention strangers and distant ones? Well, why all this ?! But these questions will hang - neither we, nor anyone else will be able to answer them.

Today's Gospel reading teaches us perhaps the most important thing. It helps us understand that our life here determines our eternal existence, and therefore concern for the salvation of the soul should be the most important priority. Everything else must be put on the periphery. That to which we devote our whole life, give our nerves, mind, for which we quarrel with people, will not go anywhere. All this is peripheral in relation to the main thing that we are talking about now - about the state of our soul, about the strength and purity of our feelings, with which we will appear before the Lord. And not when the whole world perishes, but simply when our heart stops beating.

Therefore, of course, it is possible, responding to a certain curiosity characteristic of everyone, to reflect on the end of the world. And you don't have to think about it - it has nothing to do with us. Our own personal end of the world is related to us, which, my dears, is not far off, even if we are very young. Because 50, 70, and 100 years are an instant even in human history, and not only in the cosmic dimension.

All that we are talking about now requires one really very important act. We must try to actualize everything we learn through the gospel, through the word of the sermon. You cannot leave the temple and forget about everything at once. Leaving Solovki Island, boarding a ship or plane, you must not forget about all the experience that we have experienced here. We must preserve this spiritual experience, and not as a nostalgia for beautiful places, but remember that state of mind, those thoughts that visited us at this holy place during the service. And the more in our life we ​​turn to the lofty, exalted, holy, coming from God, the easier it will be for us to live. We will gain great wisdom, the ability to distinguish wheat from chaff, essential from tertiary. We will help ourselves to maintain calmness and strength of mind, stop judging people,“Let your words be“ yes, yes ”,“ no, no ”; and what is greater is of the evil one ” (Matthew 5:37), the Lord teaches us.

By the prayers of the saints, whose names we pronounced with reverence today - Zosima, Savvaty, German of Solovetsky, the founders of this holy monastery - may the Lord help all of us, and the brethren, and our rulers, and our pilgrims, people occupying a high position in our society, and the simplest, to understand what is the true priority and absolute value in our life.

Help Understanding Orthodox Understanding of the Trinity,otter_pope,1597985431,"I keep trying to understand the Orthodox understanding of the Trinity, but there are often terms in the explanations that I'm not familiar with and therefore I cannot follow the argument. And this is especially frustrating, since I know that the Orthodox have a very unique understanding. Can anyone explain this to me simpler please?

Excerpt for reference: 

""As I have studied the Scriptures, Church History, and philosophical theology, I have found the Orthodox case against the Filioque to be extraordinarily powerful- when one recognizes that the eternal relationship of the Son to the Spirit is clarified only when one affirms the doctrine of the threefold distinction between essence, person, and energies. Because most Western theology works only with a twofold distinction, all sorts of problems emerge within philosophy and theology. For example, many Western theologians are at a loss to explain how the mutual indwelling (perichoresis) of the three divine persons is shared with humanity. But within Orthodox theology, we understand that this mutual indwelling is a function of the divine energies- the three persons indwell one another because they eternally share in one another’s activities (energies). As such, the creation, which exists in virtue of contingent participation in the divine energies, reflects this mutual indwelling at every level, and this Trinitarian relationship is the model for all human society- Church, State, and Family.
In philosophy, the doctrine of the divine energies clarifies and deepens our understanding of the philosophy of time. We recognize, for example, that time is not the opposite of eternity, but an icon of eternity. As past, present, and future come to dwell in one another more deeply, time is eventually glorified into eternity, where all past moments reach their goal and the future, towards which the present strains, is wholly realized in eschatology. Moreover, we recognize that timelessness is not identical to eternity. Timelessness is predicated of God as He is in essence, and is an apophatic statement. It means simply that the concept of time altogether transcends the divine essence. But time is real, because it is the result of God’s energetic upholding of the creation from glory to glory. Without an understanding of the threefold distinction, it is difficult to see how a person could affirm that time is real at all- leading some theologians to see time as simply a line on a piece of paper, where all moments are equally real to God.""

Veneration of the Most Holy Eucharist,Breifne21,1597983291,"Roman (Latin) Catholic here:

Just wondering how you guys venerate the Holy Eucharist? 

I know you don't have as developed a tradition of Eucharistic adoration as we do (Benediction, Perpetual Adoration etc) but I have noticed the profound reverence and adoration that you show to the Eucharist in the Divine Liturgy. 

I wondered if you could tell me how you venerate the Eucharist on a more daily level? Like, when you enter a church, do you bow towards the tabernacle, genuflect, etc? Do you spend time with Our Lord in private adoration?

Items Have Power? Request made by evil entities prior to near fatal attack,throwawaypumpkinpies,1597960277,"In the past I was told items, even blessed items, were just items and did not hold any, ""power."" To believe they did, I was told, was to be superstitious and maybe even at risk of committing some sin. However, what happened in my life raises questions about this. I'd like to hear from the faithful about this. What I'm about to share is only one percent of what transpired. By the grace of God, I was rescued and saved, but the attacks did not stop there. They continue to this day in various degrees, but nothing as sinister as their former attack. Now they appear to be distant, and I know it is God alone and through the help of the angels which keep the foul ones from overtaking me again.

All praise and honor and glory to thee Almighty God. Thank you for your deliverance, forgive me for my cowardice, my pride, my weakness, my straying from You. Jealously protect me, God, as I am yours.

To keep it brief, I had been in contact with evil entities for some time. They eventually desired to enter me, and one of their requests prior to their visitation and attacks was to remove all Christian items from the room. I had a few items which had been blessed by different priests, as well as Bibles and other Christian items from when I had been a practicing Christian. Once I moved these items it didn't take long before the visitation and eventual attacks began. Because I was stupid, this experience almost ended in my death. Instead, I was spared and saved by God, and I pray that he jealously protects me forever.

So what am I to believe, here. What are other Christians to believe from this experience? I was told, for example, that holy water does not contain any special powers. I was told it was a reminder of our baptism. Yet it must contain some power as people on the web have shared their experiences with protective powers of holy water and other items.

On the flip side, when someone becomes a Christian they are usually told to get rid of any negative items they may have in their home. Now I believe there must be some type of power, but not worthy of worship, in, on, or around blessed items and even unblessed Christian items. Though I don't know what form it would take. I'd like to read any shared experiences as well as your thoughts on whether or not Christian items contain some type of power and why if it's superstition I was told to remove these items from the room by the bastards.",OrthodoxChristianity

"I wish to learn more about christianity, but I don't know how/where to start",lafogo1637,1597952469,"Hello everyone!

At the start of the post, out of respect to the community I want say that I'm really not sure about my faith, and I hope it is ok for me to ask your advice.

I don't wish to reveal too much about my personal life, but I feel I it is important to explain my perspective as clearly as possible.

I was born in a country which is something over 90% orthodox, and the orthodox church has played, and still plays an instrumental part in our history and national identity.

I did not grow up in a religious family, but still a family which insisted on education, and so from a purely historical perspective I know a lot about my country's orthodox church as an institution.

For work reasons I have been spending years outside of my home country. I miss my home terribly. And as time has gone by I have found solace and refuge in reading my country's history and the works of our greatest novelists.

However, I have noticed something I did not expect to happen. I have started to miss the part of my life which involed the orthodox church. The part which is not simply historical. The little things in my life, the customary religious festivities, the sense of a good hearted community, the feeling of overwhelming peace on occasional visits to the church, with it's quiet walls and the perfume of incense.
Now, more than ever, I feel open to understanding and learning about orthodox christianity, and reconnecting to my roots. 

So after all this sappy talking, my question:

Can you guys suggest to me some book(s) to start with? Something completely basic down to the core, for someone who doesn't truly understand christianity to start learning.


P.S. In case someone suggests talking to a local priest, I would love to, but the closest orthodox church is 160km away from where I live right now. And I don't own a car. All I can hope for is a book.

TLDR: I need a really basic book to start learning about orthodox christianity.",OrthodoxChristianity
Dealing with Church Politics,TheMadBaronRvUS,1597950753,"By way of introduction, I have quite an ambivalent history with Orthodoxy due to an incident with the ROCOR priest who baptized me which nearly drove me from the faith, until I started attending the local OCA parish and found a much healthier environment. That was about two years ago.

Over time, I noticed parishioners leaving this church. At first it was a trickle, and now, since last winter or so, it’s a flood. This includes the deacon, who with some others has now started a mission parish in town, and church council members. During the annual general meeting last winter, the priest indicated he was aware of “complaints” having been made against him. People there are generally not gossipy and I still don’t quite know what the problem is.

I took a break from church for a while as I continue to work through my issues stemming from my old parish, and recently began attending services again. I noticed a tense and hostile atmosphere and low attendance, even in light of COVID restrictions. Coincidentally, I just received a message from a friend at the parish saying that he is leaving for a variety of reasons, largely owing to poor administration and what borders on clerical abuse which I won’t elaborate on. So many people have now left that it seems the financial viability of the parish is in doubt, and certainly from a spiritual standpoint it isn’t a healthy or positive atmosphere for anyone remaining.

I have only just been able to recommit myself to church and needless to say this is a shock. My own experience with this priest is that he can be strict, maybe a bit neurotic from a certain point of view, but is a serious and caring individual who I value as a parish priest and spiritual father, despite my own flaws  occasional inability to participate in church as I work through personal issues. I don’t want to pack up and go, and as I’ve had nothing but a good history with this church and priest, have no plans to exit. But we’re approaching a point where the parish itself might be in jeopardy.

I live in a city with nine Orthodox churches and this is the only one with English services. I’ve spent time in various other jurisdictions and know that I will not thrive or survive in an ethnic parish.

Has anyone else encountered a situation like this? What did you do? What did the hierarchy do (ie. was anything done to address it)? It is very strange and surreal.",OrthodoxChristianity

Questions on divorce (not the usual ones),RockyMountainRangers,1597944376,"Hello everyone, you may remember me from a previous threat I made as a Catholic who is considering Orthodoxy. Obviously one of the biggest stumbling blocks for me has been the issue of divorce and remarriage in the Orthodox Church. After doing quite a bit of studying, I am convinced that the early church was not as uniform on this issue as Catholic apologist make it out to be, and I believe the theology behind the Orthodox View makes quite a bit of sense. However I have a couple questions that are not normally asked about divorce.

First, was divorce and remarriage ever practiced in the Eastern Catholic churches? I've seen this claim made online multiple times, and I read an excerpt from a book by a melkite Archbishop where he defends the practice of remarriage. But other than that book I haven't been able to find a concrete Source on whether Eastern Catholics have historically allowed re marriage. I have seen many people online claiming that they used to until the 20th century when Rome force them to change.

Secondly, how big of an issue was divorce and remarriage during the great schism? I have admittedly read only a little on the events surrounding the Schism itself, but from what I've seen divorce and remarriage didn't seem to pop up. Melkite Archbishop Zhogby also claimed at the second Vatican Council that the West did not have a problem with free marriage during the Schism itself, and it was only later that they began to criticize the Orthodox for their approach.

These aren't exactly apologetics questions, I'm just curious if anyone has the answer. This is more of a question for r/catholic_orthodox but that subreddit seems kind of dead right now. I also found a thread on this topic r/Catholicism but nobody in that seems I have any concrete answers either. If Rome allowed the Eastern Catholic churches to practice divorce and remarriage, that would be a pretty devastating blow to the claim that they have held strong to the teaching on marriage while the East has capitulated. But other than that archbishop's book I don't have enough concrete evidence to feel comfortable using that argument.

Let me know if you guys have any insight into these questions, and I appreciate any answers. Pray for me.",OrthodoxChristianity

How would you suggest helping somebody who is open to understanding their faith better?,pinkyelloworange,1597910360,"TL;DR: My grandmother has mental health issues, I think it would be helpful if she would understand and practice Christianity more. She is open to the idea/broadly believes in it.

So my grandmother has started having some mental health issues since her husband died. Long story short she is literally psychotic and that has been keeping her inside the house way before corona and is causing her a lot of distress. Recently we've taken her to a doctor and he's prescribed some pills that really seem to work. She is much more energetic, less angry and fearful, talks to her hallucinations less. I have seen her do things she used to do before she got her hallucinations, like pray Psalms in the morning and this really made me giddy and gave me hope that not only could her quality of life improve but maybe she could start growing closer to Christ.   


 She is EO, I'm RC, but I really think that it would be beneficial for her, both spiritually and psychologically to start ""getting into"" her religion (for lack of a better phrase). I know it's up to the Holy Spirit, but it would be fantastic if she would frequent the sacraments or really grow into her faith. I don't know how to phrase it, but whilst she broadly believes she has a ton of misconceptions, whilst I'm not EO I know enough about it, and it is similar enough that I can clearly detect some things that are off. Anyhow, I was wondering if it is considered normal to suggest that maybe she could talk to a priest? Or I was wondering if I should ask if there are any sort of smaller social groups tied to our neighboring parish, she could start by joining those. I'm just trying to think of ideas to sort of help her understand her faith better and practice it. What would you suggest? We might have to be cautious because of corona for a while, but the gist is there. It might be dramatic but I honestly don't want to think about dying with all these crazy and maddening psychotic episodes (the pills help, but I really that not even the pills and the therapy are guaranteed to take it away fully. She might have to live with this) and depression and all that and not having the best relief possible both on a natural and supranatural level. Thanks in advance.",OrthodoxChristianity

Questions and concerns if I were to convert,TossAwayPotato,1597849106,"Hello all!

I was baptised in a Canadian United Church and brought up non denominational. For years, my parents sent me to a Catholic school and for about 10 years now, I've been following Catholicism but never actually joined officially. 

I've recently began to research Orthodox and I'm stunned at its history , I'm now thinking the chances of it being the true and OG Christianity are extremely high. But I'm very nervous since I've been following Catholicism for so long. It seems nearly identical except no Pope, no rosary, and a slightly less extreme act of Mary veneration (please correct me if I'm wrong) but still it's intimidating to me.

I live in a big city with over 100 Catholic churches to pick from, but yet maybe a few Orthodox churches. Question 1: why wouldn't the orthodox church want to brand it's self in every corner like the Catholic Church? If I moved to a small town like I'm planning, and the orthodox church isn't a hop skip and a Jump away like a Catholic Church , is that a problem?

Home Icons- quality or quantity?,_beingstill_,1597847648,"I've noticed a habit with some to collect icons and to have a wall instead of a corner. Is there a reason for having so many icons? I understand if it is large family with their patron saints, but can one get into the habit of collecting icons just to have them? This isn't a judgement, but I was wondering how many icons did one have in the home before the advent of online stores, or maybe 50 years ago? I don't come from an Orthodox family so I have no way of knowing what a non-convert home would normally look like. 

 It seems that there are now proliferating many lower-priced options such as Legacy or Uncut Mtn. Supply, do you think this is sort of flooding the Orthodox market with more things to buy? I'm a happy customer of both companies, but I do see a glut of sellers online. Ebay, Etsy etc... all have lots of cheap options than just feels really focused on consumption. Or maybe its always been like this? 

I've decided that I'm going to start saving to purchase hand painted icons and have fewer of them. I purchased a small hand painted icon for my child's baptism and it just feels much richer, more alive. I didn't expect to sense such a difference, but I really enjoy praying before it more than the printed icons in my corner. Normally I try to be a bit more distanced from material objects (I'm always striving to be a minimalist), but the hand painted icons really draws me into a sense of sacredness and God's presence.

Hung Up on One Thing/Ways to Get Involved,AdVictoriam1776,1597787466,"Good evening all, I have been an Orthodox inquirer for a while now and have had the blessing of a Bishop at my parish guiding me through all my doubts and hurdles. I have asked him this question before but still have an iffy feeling about it. Here it is-

The Catholic Church is very visible on charity and service to the needy. Orthodoxy in America is less, shall we say, institutional in their almsgiving- there are fewer established charities and institutions that individuals can get involved with and/or give to- IOCC, OCMC, and OCPM do come to mind... Take for example a Catholic Church website vs an Orthodox Church website. Your typical Catholic parish offers several opportunities for involvement in the community, and all with the visible stamp of ""Catholic"" on it, thus spreading their message and, hopefully, the Gospel. For Orthodox parishes, services are limited to the churched- not that that isn't as important- but you will rarely find ministries for the unchurched. 

My point in all of this is that it is written that you will know Christians by their love... thus, I am taking the amount of charity and structured almsgiving as a standard for truth of one Church over the other, up there even with considerations like papal supremacy and the Filioque. Should I not be doing this, or is my approach biased?

"Question on a Passage in ""Ladder of Divine Ascent""",Hispalensis,1597757747,"Greetings,

I am reading this book of Saint John Climacus (and what a book!). In Step 4, there is this passage that I do not exactly understand (especially coming from a reading of Unseen Warfare): ""For on one occasion I initiated a discussion of stillness \[I'm sure it must be the translation for hesychia\] among the most experienced elders there. They smiled and in their own cheerful way they spopke to me courteously as follows: 'Father John, we are coporeal beings and we lead a corporeal life. Knowing this, we choose to wage war according to the measure of our weakness, and we think it better to struggle with men who sometimes rage and are sometimes contrite than to do battle with demons who are always in a rage and always carrying arms against us'."". 

Do those elders mean that it's better to live in community to fight the passions than to do like Saint John and perform hesychia alone? Or do they mean something with regards to the type of warfare we wage against the passions and the demons?

Thank you.",OrthodoxChristianity
Question on Icons and Signs of the Cross,Sertorius126,1597757551,"Howdy friends,  


I'm not from the Orthodox community. I'm a grand admirer of Byzantine(Roman) history which is entwined with the Orthodox church. Indeed the Roman empire lived and breathed Orthodoxy and defended it against the pagan and heathen. I love the Byzantine Liturgy and my favorite Orthodox Liturgy is the following:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0eit4OcDfk&amp;t=324s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0eit4OcDfk&amp;t=324s)   


I have a sincere question about Icons and the Signs of the Cross.   


We see Icons such as:

&amp;#x200B;

We read about the reforms of Patriarch Nikon who, according to this Wikipedia artcle article:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old\_Believers#Origins\_of\_reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Believers#Origins_of_reform)   


[From the above link](https://preview.redd.it/e8jam2cpirh51.png?width=1112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f12966f15dd85e071782e1bb4dcd307a4695f71a)

&amp;#x200B;

To my untrained eye it seems the ancient icons point to the correct form of the Sign of the Cross as being what is depicted therein:  ""Two fingers, index finger straight, middle finger slightly bent""  
And there is my conclusion: that the Russian reforms were unwarranted at least when brought against the evidence of the icons. The original Sign of the Cross as originally formed was as depicted in the ancient Icons.  


I'd appreciate any criticisms or refutations to this conclusion.

A stumbling block on my path towards Orthodoxy.,heidegger-,1597745187,"If converted I was, it was through the writings of Dionysius and Maximus; although not yet baptized, I would, at the moment, like to in 
the near future be.

Recently, however, I came in contact with a few strands of modern theology apparently in vogue amongst Orthodox Christians: a theology which perhaps could be categorized as 'personalist', which treats the hypostasis of the Triad as 'persons' in the modern sense of the word- as psychological agents much similar to us, if not identical. That is to me scandalous- I cannot sincerely come near with such thought without becoming deeply aggravated and almost rancorous in heart. For, at the very least, there is no Monotheism in this paradigm, in my eyes. In truth, even the term 'person' became a stumbling block for me, when talking about the Triad.

I am, therefore, unsettled by my doubts: How in vogue and aligned with the Theology of the Church is this kind of thought? When 'prosopon' is used by Theologians who are widely recognized to be faithful to the Tradition of the Church, what is the strict meaning of it? Has it, still, as it did in the first centuries of the Church, apparently, an acception approximate to ""masks""? In my perception, the Fathers of the Church were always apophatic when dealing with the Triad and admittedly although personal, they never did approximate the substances to an idea of ''personhood' as such- is that truly the case?",OrthodoxChristianity
Help with resurrection doubts,DeadCircuits,1597743332,"I have always been a spiritual seeker, one of those who can't seem to settle on a particular tradition. Having not found a feeling of a spiritual home as yet. In November last year I was caught between Buddhism, and practises based on Hinduism and the Bhagavad-Gita. I felt conflicted and pulled between the two. At the height of this confusion and despair I asked whatever forces that might be out there to send me guidance in the form of a dream. What followed was an extremely vivid and symbolic dream that culminated in the words ""you will find answers in Christ"" just as I woke up. This was very striking because not only was it a clear response to my request, but it was also not the guidance I would have volunteered for myself. For this reason I decided to take this seriously.

My issue however, is that I really struggle with the idea of a historical resurrection, and I feel as though in lots of ways that means the door is closed for me as far as being a Christian is concerned. I don't know how to proceed with this guidance given these doubts. I cannot make myself believe it, but I cannot make myself ignore this guidance (I tried to but it just keeps coming back to me). I feel like perhaps I am at the gates of my spiritual home, but I cannot find it within myself to enter. 

I suppose what I am asking is whether there are any books I might read to help me in resolving this, I am truly open minded, but at the same time I cannot manifest belief in myself by sheer force of will. What convinced you of the resurrection? What would you say to convince someone who struggles with it?

So about a year ago, I got out of a bad relationship. A very, very bad relationship that ended very badly.

The hypocrisy of this subreddit's moderation team,storrowedaway,1597703247,"I am looking for an explanation from the moderation team. I am making this complaint public, so that people can express their opinions on the matter. I also fear that if I take this exclusively to modmail, I will be ignored, which happens quite often:

Earlier today I created a post. https://redd.it/ibdys8. The post got locked but this isn't a complaint about the lock. It is what happened after the fact. 

EnterTheCabbage locked my post at **16:09:53 GMT-04:00**. 
There were 36 comments at the time of thread lock. 

20 minutes or so later, I receive a comment reply notification from superherowithnopower. How is that possible I thought? I refreshed the page. Boom, 37 comments, one more than before. 
Superhero posted his comment at **16:27:42 GMT-04:00**, more than 18 minutes following the thread lock. The comment is here: reddit.com/comments/ibdys8/_/g1wm096.

To make things clear, both /u/EnterTheCabbage and /u/superherowithnopower are moderators of /r/OrthodoxChristianity. 

Reddit only allows comments to be posted after a thread is locked if the user is a mod or admin. So, the only logical explanation for the very, very late comment is that superherowithnopower usurped the thread lock using his moderation privileges. Keep in mind that throughout the entire interaction, superhero was interacting as a typical user, and without taking a look at the sidebar, one would not assumed he is a moderator. He commented with me back and forth as a regular user. After the thread was locked, he upgraded his regular access to moderator access, posted the comment using mod access to circumvent the thread lock, and stepped down his moderator privileges. You would never guess, without looking at the time stamps closely. There is an option as a moderator, to ""comment as a moderator."" The name shows up green in this case. By unchecking this option, superherowithnopower was able to get this comment through without arousing suspicion.

This is a clear example of a moderator abusing his powers to get a last-second comment into a thread. 

Is this the precedent this subreddit wants to set? That threads are locked for everybody except for moderators, who can continue posting comments after the fact?

What would be the results of starting a petition that a Patriarchate of North America be established?,TrailerParkMonk97,1597686801,"It is obvious that the mother churches that compose our Eastern Orthodox churches in the US cause separation, animosity, and an unwelcoming atmosphere for inquirers. They step on each other and prevent the spread of the Gospel. This is especially bad because the religious platforms getting attention in the US are crowded with not only heretics and schismatics, but with blasphemers and non-sense religions (Scientology, Mormonism). I would venture to say that it is hateful to God and an abomination. Many people confuse big “T” and small “T” traditions. Many people are using the church as a vector to preserve national heritage. We give millions of dollars to our mother churches. And people are reluctant to give up that money and control.

We could accomplish so much more if we were able to move as a cohesive unit. It seems like there is very little talk of orthodox unity in the US. 

I was wondering what you’re thoughts are if we started a petition to our mother churches proposing to instate a patriarch of North America.

And yet almost all Orthodox Churches I see in America are labeled based on ethnicity/nationality 
2- conversions/outreach, why hasn't the orthodox church done more/any outreach, I have gathered from other threads that the general idea is ""we don't seek converts we let them come to us because it's their choice"" and normally I would completely agree, but the fact is in America very few people know about it and the ones that do know very little about it.

"The law - ""until heaven and earth pass away""",BOT_Kieran2,1597615259,"I have a question on the matter of the law and how exactly Matthew 5 should be interpreted.

“Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven""

In this verse Christ says ""until heaven and earth pass away"". I had a quick look through the notes in the OSB, unhelpfully it completely skips this part of the verse in the footnote commentary (but still finds space to explain what truly means).

Most interpretations take the ""until all is accomplished"" as referring to Christs resurrection. I'm not sure I agree here, because the two ""untils"" are likely intended as coinciding, that the passing away of the heaven and earth are contemporary with the ""all is accomplished"".

There's a parallel verse in Matthew 24:

""Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away""

Assuming you were willing to take a partial/full-peterist view here, you could say that the destruction of the temple in 70AD was the heaven and earth passing away, that this was the ""all is accomplished"". 

This sounds quite plausible, but it would mean that the old-testament law was in effect for the 40 or so years between Christs death and 70AD.

For some discussion on the Greek in these passages, this thread might be of interest:

https://old.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/bqycde/is_it_clear_what_jesus_was_referring_to_in_the/

Theres also the interpretation which splits the law into ceremonial and moral law, but Christ never makes this distinction, and neither does Paul. They both just talk of 'the law'. Although its possible to reach this conclusion, as Christ does soften some of the teaching on the sabbath, theres no indication that the written law has been nullified, Christ just teaches a more 'spirit of the law' approach to various matters (and even makes rules more strict). 

Paul argues a lot earlier than 70AD that the mosaic law doesn't need to be followed, which makes the above explanation of 70AD tricky. Theres likely a way to harmonise the two, but outwardly it looks as if Paul and Matthew simply disagree on this issue. 

There's also the matter of when exactly the apostles superceed the authority of the Jewish rulers, Christ says in Matthew 23:

“**The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. So practice and observe everything they tell you.** But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.""

Here Christ is still affirming the Jewish leaders as having legitimate authority.

I'm trying to get back into Christianity but I am having trouble reconciling the Trinity with John 17:3 and 1 Corinthians 8:6,anonymous123123154,1597613100,"English Standard Version translations

John 17:3 - ""And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.""

1 Corinthians 8:6 - ""yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.""

These verses really do seem to imply that only the person of the Father is the only true God, which is further backed up with an ""and"" to separate Jesus Christ from the ""true God"" who is identified as the Father.

I realize that in the Corinthians verse Christ is stated as being the one through whom all things created. And he says similarly in John 17:5 that He shared God's glory in a state of pre-existence. So it's greatly confusing. It seems like a contradictory sentence.

Really the best answer I have got is ""Well, the Father IS the only true God - but not the only true personage of God. The Son is similarly the only true God. And so is the Spirit""

I mean, I see how that makes sense in Trinitarian thought. But still... the words seem so plain. The Bible never really mentions personages of God. So when I read the Father being hailed the ""One True God"" and then it being seperated by an ""AND Jesus Christ"" - it makes me think that Trinitarianism has developed this elaborate system to where one can have their cake and eat it too.

I can't stop crying,NocturnalPatrolAlpha,1597601004,"I have struggled with fear, anxiety, and doubt my whole life. It yet remains a daily struggle, and I pray daily to God to help my unbelief. For most of my life, I was convinced that God had rejected me before I was ever born; that God was seeking *other* souls to come to repentance, but not me.

Next week, on the 25th of this month, it will be a year to the day since I started going to church again, and in that time, I have learned I could not have been more wrong, that God desires for *all* mankind, without exception, to return to his flock, and he desires this because he loves every single one of us. He loves us so much that he *became* one of us, and died for us to set us free from the clutches of death.

To go from believing you are *doomed*, that there's no one looking for you, to realizing not only *is* there an almighty, all-loving God looking for you, but there is a heavenly host of innumerable saints *praying* for you, is something that no verbal or written communication of any kind can do justice.

I've never read Luke chapter 15 with a dry eye since, and I have frequently felt quite emotional during church services over these last 11 and a half months.

This morning, during the communion portion of the liturgy - on the Feast of Saint Joachim - it was as though some sort of dam broke. Though I am not yet a full member of the Orthodox Church, and cannot receive communion, I could almost swear I felt God's hand comforting on my shoulder. God's hand on one shoulder, and Our Blessed Mother's loving hand on the other. It was all I could do to keep from bursting into tears right in the middle of everybody, and the times when I was composed enough to sing, it was barely more than a whisper.

I have been crying all morning, and I cannot seem to stop.

Please remember me in your prayers, and ask Our Mother, and all the rest of the saints to continue to intercede for me.",OrthodoxChristianity

A good friend of mine who is raised Catholic is becoming Romanian Orthodox (he is Romanian). I wanted to get him a gift because he has been thinking about doing this for quite some time and its a very special occasion. I was wondering if any Romanians on here know if there are any traditional gifts that you could give to someone in this situation? Of course, I have a couple of general ideas of my own, I just thought it might be nice to learn more about any Romanian traditions, if they exist. I haven't found much help just searching it up.  I am also happy to hear gift ideas that are orthodox generally; something  meaningful, but still simple. 

The reason I ask is because I am not sure that he would like me to pick out a cross for him. I think he has one that he is attached to and it is very simple (wood and thread). He is a very simple person and so i didn't want to get him a cliche accessory, you know? 

I was for sure going to make an icon a part of his gift, btw, i just haven't decided on if I should just get one of Jesus, his favourite saint or if I would do some research into something more specific? I am also orthodox but I have only really been learning more about my faith recently so I have some knowledge, not much, but i know the resdit community is nice and helpful.

About the connection between marriage and worldly vanity,Rich-Topic,1597546096,"&gt; Rich-Topic -6 points 1 day ago  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Why do priests have to get married first then ordained?  
&gt;  
&gt;\- A man who has devoted himself to the service of God, should not bother his head with worldly futility.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- What do you mean lol having a wife and reproducing is not futility. Its literally the most important thing in life after serving god.

*The Apostle:*

*But I want you to be without care. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord--how he may please the Lord. But he who is married cares about the things of the world--how he may please his wife.*

Interpretation:

(machine translation)

Saint Theophan The Recluse:

I want you to be without care, so that you are not tormented by evil care. Care, sadness, and multi-carefulness are the distinctive features of life in the spirit of the world and its engine. No passion seems so plausible as this; and no one does so much harm to a man in his Christian life as it does. It turns and darkens the mind, crushes and dries the heart, and does not allow you to change your mind, driving from one thing to another, without end. How can we become careless? ""If we remain celibate.""

And a celibate man may not have the care of pleasing God; but a married man, though he would like to take care of this, cannot, as he would like to, for his wife, children, and home interfere, all of which require care and care. *But he who is married cares about the things of the world -- how he may please his wife.* Where the wife is, there is family and home: and here is the field of care. The wife herself has many necessary needs; and if vanity and a desire to keep up with the requirements of the age are instilled into this, then they (needs) cannot be enumerated. Celibacy frees a man from all such worries and frees his hands to do things that please God, of course, if he wants to. If you want to please the Lord, he says, then a celibate state is the most suitable one. His needs are easily satisfied, and then he can devote all his time to the Lord. And for a married man, most of the time is taken up by cares, vanity, and peace, even in the best directions of married life. Therefore, the married can never reach such a degree of spiritual perfection as the celibate.

\*\*\*\*

So, with the worldly vanity sorted out. It would be strange, having begun the most exalted service to God, to turn to the vanity of courtship, marriage, and the honeymoon. For a man who takes Holy orders while married, this fuss is already over.

As for ""Its literally the most important thing in life after serving God"" - for women - perhaps. *""For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression. Nevertheless she* ***will be saved in childbearing*** *if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.""* Not for man. For a man, the first place is his business/occupation/vocation. (And, thank God, only man can be priests.) I know that in modern western culture, women and their interests are deities. But we are talking about Orthodoxy.",OrthodoxChristianity

You must pray literally unceasingly with prescribed times in the Morning and evening and before all meals - or else!

You must fast at all the prescribed times in the exact precise way - or else!

You must attend vespers, Orthros and Liturgy at bear minimum - or else!

And much more. I want to understand Christianity and salvation in the eastern way, but I cannot help but make sense of it in the western sense of commandments, judgement and the constant threat of eternal damnation. As I’ve mentioned in the past, the ‘archchair Bishops’ and internet ‘hyperdox’ who preach fire and brimstone do not help. I just want to repent in peace, and not fear for my salvation.

I really, really want to understand salvation in the true eastern sense, but western Christianity and it’s fire and brimstone theology has polluted by understanding of Eastern Christianity. How can I overcome this? Has anyone experienced something similar? If so, how did you overcome it?

Confession at home?,TheGameMaster11,1597525460,"Is it possible to do one at home, without a priest?

I just watched video on a certain Orthodox commentator (apparently I can't say his name or my post will be deleted?) why he's not RC and it got me thinking and I got some more questions:

-Marian Apparitions. It seems that Mary comes in these apparitions, especially in the last 150 years, to establish devotion to her Immaculate Heart, the rosary, and Catholic dogmatic teaching (the immaculate conception for example), all of which I know Orthodoxy disagrees with. I know Apparitions aren't dogma, but why would the Theotokos teach that which is contrary to Orthodoxy? Do you believe these apparitions to be from the demonic instead?

-Do you guys have devotions to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary? And if not, is it...weird to you guys that Catholics do? Or worse, is it heretical? The guy I watched seems to think it is Nestorian

-Where is the ""unity of the church"" in orthodoxy? When I see things like differing opinions about contraception, and especially on baptism (do you need to be baptized again if xyz, etc) then it makes me skeptical of so called unity in the Orthodox Church.

-What churches would you say are in schism rn? I hear from some the oriental church, and if so, why?

-Why is the papacy false? It seems like this gives the RCC a visible sign of unity

"Loneliness, and leaving for college in a week: a cry for advice",GizmoRazaar,1597286706,"Evening, siblings in Christ,

I wanted to reach out about these issues in a public forum to seek advice, and since I desire to become Orthodox (I'm happy to oblige if you ask questions regarding that), I figured this would be a place that I could seek advice.


Simply put, I feel lonely because all throughout high school, I felt disconnected from others and didn't have meaningful connections; sure, I've made plenty of friends, some I would even call close friends. But as circumstance would have it (some of it due to COVID), I feel a lack of presence in their lives, and theirs in mine. The friends that I did have, I feel that I've grown distant from. Even still, with other friends I don't even talk to regularly anymore.


I just feel like there's no one around besides my girlfriend to have companionship with, which is where college comes in: next week, I begin university as a freshman, prepping to spend months away from my family in a new place, surrounded by new people, with new goals and lifestyles; I'll be almost completely independent, a kid thrust into an adult world. And granted, a college life could certainly be a pampered and protected one, and is far easier to live than that of many others. Yet, while I am indeed excited to finally step out and meet new people, I'm afraid of how it will go.


Ever since I became a Christian (not specifically Orthodox) almost 3 years ago, I've felt distant from my peers for how different my faith sets me apart from them. Frankly, I've always been a little different from others, and thus I'm not connected to many people very closely. But this became especially apparent in my sophomore-junior years, when I began taking my relationship with God far more seriously. This led me to feel distant from others my age, who'd say and do things that, for lack of appropriate words, do not bring glory to God. 


The college I'm going to is a Christian college, though it is a protestant one. Thankfully, there is an OCA parish close to campus (we'll have on campus experiences with social distancing procedures) and I'm planning to become a catechumen there once I'm settled in. Suffice to say, I'm very excited to finally be getting closer to the day I step into adulthood, but also frightened at its prospects. I feel like God is dangling me outside of plane into the sky a little bit here, and even though I've got several parachutes, it's still daunting.


Within all my ramblings, which I really do appreciate you for listening to, I just want to know how I can prep for school, how to know where and with who God is leading, and any relevant advice that'll help dispel my loneliness and build confidence for what's to come.

I thank you again for reading this and giving me your precious time, and may God grant you everlasting peace and comfort.",OrthodoxChristianity
[Apologetics] Suggest Good Books for People with Scientific/Scientist Mindset,Hispalensis,1597281053,"Greetings,

I have a good friend that, although a good and very intelligent (scientist) person, has no interest in religion, or even symbolism. It's not a matter of hatred. At best it's hidden contempt. He even has no interest in philosophy, no even epistemology (which I feel is a lot of time a problem with scientist, even if it feels it should be their primary concern). 

I'm therefore looking at a book that would be ""challenging""\* for him with regards to his mindset and open him up on religious symbolism and Orthodox Christianity. My first go to would probably be Saint Gregory of Nyssa because of the ""intellectuality"" (in the good sense) of his writings. IDK. Anybody have any suggestions?

\*By challenging I don't mean anti-modern or anti-scientific book. I just mean a text that's clear and profound enough that it will make him go ""Hmmm... I never though of it that way!"". I'm not trying to convert him, but at least to make him see things differently.

Big in Heaven by Fr. Stephen Sinari,2004athanasia,1597246755,"  

It was Christmas and my family and I were enjoying wandering around an indoor display of very fanciful decorated trees. So intrigued with the trees, I was happy to see another room full of them to wander through. I trotted off to look and WHAM! I walked straight into a mirrored wall, putting a bright red circle on the tip of my nose and forehead. Can you spell embarrassed? I quickly glanced over my shoulder to see if anyone saw me. No one did, so I casually walked in the opposite direction, giving my face time to slowly drain from the red flush of embarrassment as I rubbed the sore spot on my forehead.

That is how I felt reading Father Sinari’s short stories in “Big In Heaven.” At first, I laughed at the antics and comments of some of the parishioners at St. Alexander the Whirling Dervish parish.  I read further … and flushed with shame. A little further … and felt a twinge of hope. Maybe, just maybe, though I am more like Gus and Mary, with God’s help I’ll end up like Raskova.

The comparison of Combattimento spiritual, O Αόρατος Πόλεμος and the Невидимая брань shows, on the one hand, the close relationship of these three books, and, on the other, the fundamental difference in the teaching presented in some places. The edit made by Orthodox editors changes the very purpose of the invisible invective. If for the author of Combattimento spiritual the goal is to purify the soul from sin, then for st. Nicodemus  and St. Feofan the goal of Theophanes the Recluse is much higher – a pure, unadorned prayer that leads the Christian soul to God and connects it with Him. At the same time, the purity of soul that Skupoli strives for is only a preparatory stage. In a number of places in his book, Scupoli teaches how to stimulate imagination, emotion, and fantasy in order to achieve success in the work of cleansing from sin. It is clear that this is unacceptable for Orthodox authors and it is impossible to achieve pure prayer by following this path. Erp. Nicodemus not only removes all such passages when editing, but also adds an entire Chapter ""on the correction of imagination and memory"" (Chapter 25 O Αόρατος Πόλεμος), in which he says that ""a multiform, multi-compound and debilitated imagination"" is a consequence of the fall, and in order to return to the freedom of communion with God, we need to clear our minds of mental images. There he shows the reader the means by which this can be achieved. In another place st. Nicodemus adds the doctrine of controlling the senses, which Scupoli does not have (in addition to Chapter 24, ""how to control language""). Similarly, the st. Nicodemus applies when working on the editing of the chapters on prayer. It leaves the chapters on meditation virtually unchanged, but it also changes the very meaning of meditation. In his presentation, meditation (or reflection) is not needed to ""encourage thought, imagination, emotion, and desire"", but for heartfelt regret for their sins and emotion.

St. Feofan goes further in his work. It completely clears the text of the O α Αρρατος Πόλεμος from those passages that may not seem quite correct from the point of view of Orthodox moral and ascetic teaching. Therefore, there is no mention of meditation in the Invisible invective, and it is in these chapters that Scupoli most clearly showed himself as ""a child of his time and country»95. St. Theophan, replacing the chapters on prayer with his own, managed to convey the patristic teaching about pure and ugly prayer with the utmost clarity.

On the other hand, from the doctrine of prayer offered by the PRP. Nicodemus and SVT. Theophanes can draw a conclusion about the difference between the types of piety in Russia of the XIX century96 and in Greece at the turn of the XVIII-XIX centuries. Nicodemus offers the reader his edition of the Ignatian prayer tradition. And this version of it does not cause rejection in the Greek Orthodox environment, while Russian Orthodoxy does not accept the Ignatian tradition in any form.

[https://azbyka.ru/otechnik/Ignatij\_Brjanchaninov/o-prelesti/1](https://azbyka.ru/otechnik/Ignatij_Brjanchaninov/o-prelesti/1) :

As an example of an ascetic book written out of a state of delusion called opinion, we can cite the work of Thomas of Kemp under the title Imitation of Jesus Christ. It breathes a refined voluptuousness and high-mindedness, which in people blinded and filled with passions produce a pleasure that they recognize as a taste of divine grace. Unhappy and overshadowed! They do not understand that, having smelled the subtle stench of the passions that live in themselves, they enjoy it, recognize it in their blindness as the stench of grace! They do not understand that only saints are capable of spiritual pleasure, that spiritual pleasure must be preceded by repentance and purification from the passions, that the sinner is incapable of spiritual pleasure, that he must recognize himself as unworthy of pleasure, reject it if it begins to come to him, reject it as uncharacteristic, as a clear and pernicious self-delusion, as a refined movement of vanity, high-mindedness and voluptuousness. Like Malpas, Francis d'asiz, Ignatius Loiola, and other Latin ascetics, who were recognized as saints in the interior of the Monastery, achieved the greatest devilish charm in their Hermitage. ""When Francis was taken up to heaven,"" says the writer of his life, "" God the Father, when he saw him, was for a moment at a loss to whom to give the advantage. Whether to his son by nature, or to his son by grace, Francis."" What could be more terrible, uglier than this abuse, sadder than this charm!

I'm an inquirer - wife is devout Mormon. Could I even be baptized?,culturedmold,1597039010,"Hello!

I've been a lurker here for a while. I was raised a true believing Mormon, (went on a mission, married in the Temple, etc.) but have been on a spiritual journey for a while now, trying to discern where God is calling me to worship. 

I've attended many different churches, and have been reading and learning as much as I can. I've attended Divine Liturgy multiple times and have met with a Priest once. The present situation of Covid-19 has made fellowshipping with parishioners difficult but I hope to get to know more Orthodox people as the situation gets under control.

Currently I'm reading ""introducing the Orthodox Faith"" by Anthony Coniaris. In the book, he talks about how an Orthodox Christian married to a non-Christian loses the ability to participate in the sacraments unless the unbelieving spouse converts to Christianity.

My wife is still a very devout Mormon. She has been supportive of my search for truth, but has no interest herself in entertaining even the idea of becoming Christian. As I search for truth I feel like I'm being pulled by the Spirit to the Orthodox faith, and would like to become a catechumen sometime soon. That being said, would I even be able to be baptized and participate in communion due to my wife not being a Christian? Honestly this would be a huge roadblock for me, because I love my wife dearly and don't feel like it would be biblical to deny someone the sacraments because they were married to a non-Christian before they knew the Orthodox Church existed. I'm hoping someone can clarify this doctrine for me?",OrthodoxChristianity

The grass is greener next door,Down_With_The_King,1597028861,"How can I stop constantly feeling like that? When I look at Catholicism, what I see is an advanced form of Christianity that speaks of very intellectual and very spiritual things I cannot understand, and that saw the errors in Orthodoxy and fixed them. When I look at Protestantism, what I see is an even more advanced form of Christianity that speaks of extremely intellectual  things etc.,  and that fixed the problems with Catholicism. When I look at Judaism I am impressed by their strong focus on study (one Orthodox Jew says in an article that Christianity is simply too basic to get the interest of Jews, and I can see why). When I look at Islam... admittedly there is little of interest there, but I can respect how seriously they take their prayer rule. When I look at Buddhism I am impressed by their asceticism and the patience and humility they develop. And so on...

On one hand, this perspective can be good - Orthodox Christianity is a very basic and shallow religion, but this liberates it from overly focusing on deep and philosophical disputes and navel gazing, as what the Catholics and Protestants evidently stuck themselves into. On another hand, it also makes me feel almost ashamed to be Orthodox, as non-Orthodox and non-Christians always impress me so much more than Orthodox Christians do, and it discourages me. I remain Orthodox because of the deep pull I feel toward it, but I feel constantly rocked by the waves of other religious traditions and it's starting to be really tiring.

I have been interested in orthodoxy on and off during that time, maybe even held orthodox views by default during the RCIA process. 
To complicate matters, I suffer from severe scrupulosity since baptism just about. Therefore I do not know my own true reasons for pursuing orthodoxy or if I am fooling myself. I am conflicted regarding Immaculate Conception dogma and the papacy, as well as the role of confession which I can’t understand it seems for either church. 

I spoke with an orthodox priest and explained this sort of, but I’ve concluded I need to focus on the gospels and having a personal relationship with Jesus, and also I’ve got some books I plan to read by Kallistos Ware. 

My question to you, Reddit, is how do I work on my relationship with God when I feel bound by the laws of the Catholic Church?

I need help learning to resolve conflict with my parents in an Orthodox way,ArcticPinePine,1596992128,"I really need advice for this. I have brought this issue up with my Father of Confession multiple times, but I can’t help but feel like I’m being blamed for not respecting my parents. When I try to explain my actions from my perspective and say what they do is also not right, I would always get told that confession only involves my own sins and not talk about theirs and no matter what, God has created me under their authority. 

Nothing would make me happier than having a strong relationship with my parents. Unfortunately though, it’s become a habit of my parents to repeatably become defensive against my personal opinions, my likes and dislikes, my personality etc. and lead to controlling behaviours. Whenever we get into these arguments, they always tell me they’re going to tell my Father of Confession about me, how I can’t face God for all the sins I do against them, how I need to confess to save myself (the list goes on and on).

My problem is I don’t know how to handle conflict with my parents in an Orthodox way. For me, I just shut down and not speak to either of them for days (even weeks). I think it’s a better solution than risking having a conversation that will 99% end in a fight and lead to one of the arguments listed above. However, I do feel guilty that this is my go-to resolution as I continue to do this even after a petty argument has cooled down. 

I’m not exaggerating when I say literally anything I do will provoke a negative reaction, particularly from my mom. My most recent argument started when I was sitting on a couch and my dad will ask me if he can get something from my room (I agreed, he didn’t need to ask though) and my mother said “See how we have to ask him permission to do things? See how sensitive and angry he becomes when I say the truth? He KNOWS I’m right and now he’s embarrassed to say anything because he knows it’s true.” 

When I previously asked for advice on other subs, the majority were telling me to cut them out of my life, move out, do whatever I want etc which are all equally non-Christian suggestions. Although I’m 22, the option of moving out isn’t available until I’m married (and honestly it’s financially logical to live at home for the time being).

Interest of Orthodoxy from a Messianic,LogNo751,1596990567,"I have been intrigued by the Orthodox traditions, and I’ve read Timothy Ware’s book which was interesting in opening up the interest. So in my Christian journey I’ve loosened up a bit in the bible department that it’s okay to tack on rituals so long as it has a Biblical basis. I understand that the Bible isn’t a how to guide. I just find it extra in the rituals Orthodoxy and Catholicism perform (not that they are un-biblical) but this was a God who led sheep herding nomads sleeping in goat tents- kind of like the keep it simple philosophy. I mean that in a sincere and not disparaging way- anyway on to the meat and bones of this post:

Questions 

1. Christmas- I don’t condone the purpose of the nativity(it’s very important), but it is the mix of paganism (Dec 25th), decorating evergreen trees, yule log (not many do this but it’s Germanic origin). In addition the time Constantine converted to Christianity the Sun was a popular deity- and what a fitting way to celebrate it’s journey with a midwinter festival. Historians have showed that Christ was born much earlier (maybe around Feast of Trumpets- oh so fitting!).

2. Easter- This is a huge issue since we celebrate Passover but accurately know that the Passover lamb was Christ. To the OT Christians Passover was God’s deliverance out of Egypt, but with Christ risen you can see the beauty in it- that it was a foreshadowing of centuries to come. Easter eggs symbolize fertility and Ishtar (the Babylonian god). Even in the NT Paul celebrates Passover, although the KJV will translate it as Easter.

3. Icons. I’ve always viewed the halo as a pagan idea as a way to acknowledge the Sun god introduced by artists but Rome let it slide (even the Catholic Encyclopedia admits this). I have no issues honoring the people, but just be known it’s culturally foreign in the 21st century America. I don’t view it as icon worship since I understand the cultural differences, just like as an American I have a hard time kissing people to say hi/bye in Europe- it’s not sexual to them but for me it’s just weird. 

It’s also paradoxically hilarious to have this viewpoint when paganism exists in our language with Norse gods being the days of the week (Thor, Odin, Fryggs) and the months as well. It just feels weird putting a tree up in my house just as pagan centuries before had done except I would be doing it in the name of Christ.

Anyways I do mean this in a sincere, open minded way. Do pagan origins even matter if we are so far removed from it? Just feels weird dying eggs with kids, and decorating a tree just as pagan peoples have done except I’m doing it for Christ.",OrthodoxChristianity

Crisis of Faith Over Circumcision,SnooCompliments1696,1596945652,"Sorry if this is sexually explicit. But this isn't an issue I can talk about publicly to others.

Perhaps this isn't the typical post here: but a problem of mine has destroyed all of my faith in God. One of my narrow fields of interest relates to politics, philosophy, and religion. So I recently became aware of the ethical and medical controversy related to the practice of routine neonatal circumcision in the United States.
This only became an obsessive interest of mine due to a problem with two extremely erogenous parts of my body: that was causing me to become involuntarily sexually aroused when I didn't want to be.
To give a graphic and perhaps TMI example. It felt like I was getting stimulated while I was out eating. So that those parts were getting licked/teased when I was out dinning at a restaurant.

This is much less fun than you'd imagine. Random erections, feelings of oral stimulation when non-aroused, etc. is completely terrible.

But also understandably: I'm high-functioning enough to the point to be completely aware that this is not a casual topic that you bring up to either your parents or friends.

So I consulted online resources. And I didn't like what I found.

To understand what was partially wrong with my ding-dong. It turns out those regions of my body are called the frenulum and frenular delta. And yes: they are supposed to be extremely sexually pleasing.

I came across a Wikipedia article on the subject. It turns out that on the vast majority of circumcised men... and that those regions are either completely destroyed or damaged.
At first glance I thought this was complete BS created by some European troll to get back at many American men.

Surely... if this was the case of sexually sensitive tissue being removed, even by accident, it would be illegal throughout the Western developed world, or at least something of great political and ethical controversy, right?

Thinking it was a joke — and getting increasingly anxious — I went onto Reddit's average penis forums and started looking at the back of the men's penises in perhaps the most heterosexual way I could...

And I was cringing while being completely horrified.

90-95% of them have either completely removed frenular delta's or frenulum's... or one's that are completely damaged. I'm not a big fan of looking at other men's genitalia: but you can verify this is true yourself.

I started essentially Joker laughing (from the train scene in the 2019 version)

And just kept internally saying: ""I'm not crazy. Everyone else is.""

I'm a male. And like 84% percent of American males in the late 90s: some of my foreskin was removed, on the recommendation of medical doctors, shortly after I was born. They told my parents were told that it would reduce the rate of sexually transmitted infections, prevent UTI's, and prevent prostate and penile cancer.

Mine was apprently much less aggressive than the normative American version. It was basically a partial. Since I've apparently ""only lost"" my outer foreskin, ridged band, and dartos muscle.
And a lot of the horror stories of significantly lost sexual pleasure in adults seem to relate to the frenular delta, frenelum, inner foreskin, (""low/tight cut"") etc. being heavily removed.

The problem is?

That's exactly what happened to many of the men who posted there. They're simply lacking normal parts of their genitalia due to an operation that was forced upon them at birth.

I consulted my doctor about this:

1.) Firstly, to consult about treatment to reduce stimulation to my frenular delta and frenelum.

2.) To ask her if circumcision reduces the types of sexual enjoyment that can be enjoyed. And whether it reduces sexual pleasure in men who have had those parts of their bodies apparently completely removed.

She responded to me respectfully.... And stated that I should apply powder to help ease stimulation to that area.

The I asked her about circumcision:

""Hey... I know this might be a little awkward. But do uncut guys feel more? Because I found out that most of my friends/other men don't have that part on part of their own bodies...""

But her response to the other question puzzled, bemused, and shocked me.

""Most circumcised men your age don't have that part, yes... but studies have generally found that circumcision doesn't reduce sexual pleasure... it's supposed to be like that, it's a very sexually pleasing and sensitive area.""

And then I responded.

""Wouldn't it being removed at least prevent some types of sexual enjoyment? Like men couldn't have that type of enjoyment through that tissue... since it's not on their body?""

""Well, no. Studies haven't found that. The AAP recommends it for children... but says it is not essential for their well-being... but most families have their children undergo the medical procedure... it's not a big deal.""

I'm just shocked. It seems like a giant act of cognitive dissonance to say that removing specialized sexual tissue doesn't at least reduce the types of sexual stimulation and pleasure that can be enjoyed.

You lose all sensation in removed tissue, right? That should be pretty obvious.

How does no one see this? As I researched further, it became increasingly apparent to me that the justifications for the procedure are completely bunk.

I'm probably only going to have sex with 1-2 girls in my lifetime. How does a 5% theorized reduction in STD's, and perhaps a greater reduction of HIV, justify removing pleasurable sexual tissue on my body? UTI's can be treated through antibotics, and women have far more of them, and penile cancer is an extremely rare cancer.

An additional American justification for tbe procedure is that the foreskin and the ridged band are ugly and unaesthetic. But I completely disagree with this perspective. I think that the ""stretching"" of the ridged band and foreskin is completely fascinating.

And that having those particular specialized sexual tissues would be fun to have with my future wife. I know that some Americans may cringe at the idea. But I think any girl who would reject me for my genitalia aren't worth marrying in the first place.

It's my natural genitalia. Right?

And that's led me to a horrifying conclusion: It's hard for me not to see my genitalia as mutiliated because of this. And it's caused me to completely lose faith in the American medical profession.

It makes the society fools, my parents completely misled on the issue, and the people who are supposed to heal you either completely incompetent or sociopathic.

I know that many people have differing opinions on circumcision. But I personally interpret what was done to me as a sexual harm and mutilation because of this.

And it's destroyed my self-confidence, trust in society, and want for a female sexual partner.

Simply put: why should I trust them?

I strongly suspect that I got a version of the procedure that probably reduced my sexual pleasure and sensation much less than others. But it does affect me psychologically. Everytime I now look at my penis: I see the mark of some incompetent butcher masquerading as a loving and helping doctor who removed healthy and functional parts of my genitalia.

The scary thing is? If I didn't have those parts still on my body: I might have never known what I was missing.

And I still wonder heavily what forms of sexual enjoyment I'll be missing until surgery to reverse circumcision is possible.

It shouldn't sound crazy. But I just want the genitalia I was born with. And this whole episode has completely killed my faith in the medical profession.

How much bigger of an f-up can you get than convincing your loving parents to remove specialized sexual tissue from your genitalia shortly after your birth? Why should I trust any of what these associated collection of butchers, incompetents, psychopaths, maniacs, and fools say?

Circumcision has completely destroyed my trust in the medical profession. And perhaps for good. I've spent days crying about what happened to me at birth.

It's destroyed my faith in God as well.

How could this procedure be commanded in tbe Old Testament? Why would God command the removal of sexually sensitive tissue from children's bodies?

I don't understand.

Even the allegedly more minor versions of the procedure - in the Bible - remove or damage Taylor's ridged band. And it just becomes a degree of harm issue...

Taylor's ridged band is the tip of the foreskin, and highly sensitive, so even the more mild version was still pretty invasive.

I'm just struggling with it. How could God command the sexual harm of children? It directly goes against everything I thought about him.
I was always taught that sexual pleasure within marriage was good. And that it represented the beautiful love between Christ and His church. The writings of the Song of Songs, etc. And that God would never command us to hurt others. And to love them with all of our heart.

And now it just seems like a complete lie. I feel horribly betrayed. Like everything I believed as a child was untrue. That I was mistaken.

Unless some form of restoration process comes out: it seems like I'll never fully be able to truly experience sexual love between me and my future wife. It's horrifying. I have inferior, mutilated genitalia. I cringe when I look at myself in the mirror.

Not because of what I was given: but what was taken.

And my parents did it under the assumption that it was healthy/they were helping me to get closer to God. (e.g. ""Although not commanded... I'd be like Jesus... and it was probably a health issue in the OT."")

I don't get how God could command kids to be sexually hurt.

I wish I had unaltered genitalia. I wish God could explain why this happened to me. I wish I could undertand why some form (probably more minor) version of the procedure was commanded in the old covenant.

Pray for me? Because I'm in a tough situation.

I'm horrified at what was done to me.",OrthodoxChristianity

Looking for insight as somebody who is very interested but also lacks much understanding about the beliefs that make up Orthodoxy,greenmuhfuckingoblin,1596828940,"I have had an interest in Orthodoxy ever since I have read the Way of a Pilgrim, yet I must admit there are many things that trouble me that I do not want to criticize, but do admittedly fail to understand how these things are applicable to Christian Doctrine in regards to Scripture. I am not a man of great knowledge or understanding on things like this or even of Scripture I feel so I hope nobody takes these things I list offensively as I truly am seeking only to gain a better understanding 


The main things that confuse me based off the two Orthodox books I’ve read as well as from reading different articles online are:


1. The churches view of Mary, and what the Church is saying in regards when it tells us to pray prayers of repentance such as “Through the intercession of the Theotokos, Savior, save us”- St Paisios. Why do we need anybody to intercede for us within prayer? I’m asking this genuinely as I have always failed to grasp this as well as why confession is necessary in regards to a priest when Christ is said to be the High priest of our faith. 

2. Asceticism. I have seen this theme much in orthodoxy and have definitely seen it elaborated in depth in regards to our relationship with Christ in a book I read recently called The Watchful Mind: Teaching on the Watchfulness of the Mind, which often talks about visions as well as the importance of fasting and abstaining from desire whilst focusing on Noetic prayer. I’m a bit confused and troubled on this due to what Paul said concerning asceticism and was wondering if this practice and this passage are talking about the same thing and if not, what is Paul trying to say? 

Colossians 2:16-19


16 Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. 17 These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. 18 Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions,puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, 19 and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.


Not trying to post this to insult any monks who practice asceticism, but I won’t lie that reading this passage alongside The Watchful Mind has troubled and confused me. I guess I’m just seeking to understand how the Asceticism of Orthodox monks differs from this passage, as well as if ascetic practices are 100% required whilst practicing Noetic prayer.


3, icons. I have done some research and believe I understand how venerating icons differs heavily from idolatry solely by an orthodox article I read that elaborated on the intention of veneration, yet I am still confused on why the church practices it and what it’s reasonings are


4. Not really relevant to the rest, but was wondering if anybody could give me insight on how to practice noetic prayer more diligently as well as with more genuineness of heart. I find that I allow myself to recite it to often very quickly out of anxiousness instead of truly seeking to pray this prayer, and was wondering if anybody could offer me insight on how to improve my practice for the sake of sincerity and attentiveness.

I don't disagree with statement and its role in orthodox piety. Though I wish to contrast it by sharing this quote from the theologian Father Boris Bobrinskoy (memory eternal) who fell asleep this Thursday (Aug 6)

see: [https://twitter.com/SVSPress/status/1291772252858589185?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet](https://twitter.com/SVSPress/status/1291772252858589185?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) 

Here is the quote:

&gt; **We are responsible for the world, for people, for those who have not as yet encountered Christ or who rejected him, who struggle with him or renounce him. In this respect the Church must generate in us a sense of compassion, a feeling of profound responsibility for the world which God so loved that he sent his only-begotten Son, that everyone who believes in him would not perish but have eternal life. Thus you see, if we are in Christ then, being in Christ we love and experience the fate of the whole world. In this sense we should reflect on the words of the Elder Siluan or some parts in Isaac Syrene. These saints burned with love for the whole of humanity and the whole creation.**

Question about Prayer to Saints,tacitdenial,1596807771,"Hi All,  
My family and I are planning to be received once COVID subsides and we can attend church normally. As an inquirer from a protestant background I read and was told that we ask the Saints to intercede for us. I'm not sure whether anyone told me this, but the picture I have in my mind is that God is on the throne and the Saints are like Courtiers or lieutenants, so that we can come to them and they can help us yet all under the authority of God alone.

My wife has sought Orthodox resources for our children, and gets the impression that among those Orhtodox laypeople she's been in contact with, almost all prayer is directed to this or that Saint and little mention made of God. I do not judge those people in the slightest, yet I wonder if their approach (as reported) is the one we should use ourselves. Two questions:

1. How do you discern between Tradition and tradition?
2. Is there room for variation of emphasis between families or between cultures?

I am at peace with what's in my Orthodox Study Bible, the Creeds and Councils, the Divine Liturgy, icons I'm familiar with, and the daily offices. All these clearly indicate that Saints are servants of God. However, I'm uncomfortable teaching my children to pray to them in a way that could seemingly leave out the supremacy of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, or leave prayer directly to God in a secondary role.

In morning and evening prayers, we go directly to God (including the Lord's Prayer) and venerate the Theotokos. This seems like a wonderful foundation. And I am so thankful to have the beautiful words provided by the Church for times that I may have no words -- probably the times I most need prayer. How does one integrate prayer to Saints with this, and is variation in this okay?

I'll also talk to my priest about this separately. Just curious what thoughts come up here. Thank you all.",OrthodoxChristianity

The Orthodox View of Marriage,Kierkaguardian,1596775026,"I have what I hope is a relatively simple question:

Am I *required* to affirm and believe the Orthodox position on marriage in order to become a member of the Orthodox church?

I've done a fair amount of reading on the subject of marriage in scripture and its interpretations in the primitive/early church, Catholicism, and Orthodoxy, and I'm having a bit of trouble coming to accept the Orthodox view. What my wife and I believe is that marriage is *once and for all* unless, and until, the death of the spouse, and that widowers alone can remarry. 

We believe divorce is always a sin, and any remarriage for either of the divorced persons while their first spouse still lives is adultery for both the divorcee, and the one who marries the divorced person. Only the *porneia* exception allows for anything else (though my understanding of the Matthean exception clause also differs from the Orthodox view as I've understood it.) 

So my question is: would I be allowed to hold to this view and still be allowed to be accepted into Orthodoxy? I would not intend to make waves within any church I join, and I can express and accept the possibility that I may be wrong on this issue.

FWIW I have reached out to a priest on this issue and I do intend to read Meyendorff's book on the subject.",OrthodoxChristianity

Struggling between Catholicism and Orthodoxy,RockyMountainRangers,1596745861,"I hate to make another ""Catholic thinking of going East"" post on this subreddit since it's already littered with them, but I posted the same thing over on r/Catholicism, and I wanted to get as much input as possible.

 Basically, I converted to Catholicism  from atheism five years ago. For  about the last year, I've had  lingering doubts about the Catholic  Church. Lately I've given serious  thought to converting to Orthodoxy, to  the point where I've been  attending Divine Liturgy and speaking to the  priest at my local  Antiochan Orthodox church. I've obviously been doing  plenty of reading,  particularly ""His Broken Body"" by Fr Laurent  Cleenewerck. I'm halfway  through the book, and I'm pretty much convinced  at this point that the  first millennium church never recognized  anything like Vatican I papal  supremacy, even if the Roman Church  understood itself as having unique  powers and responsibilities based on  Matthew 16:18 very early on.  Furthermore, the idea of ""eucharistic ecclesiology"" has made a big  impression on me. In a nutshell, it's the idea that Christians gathering  around the bishop to celebrate the Eucharist represents the ""Catholic  Church"" in its fullness, and anything more than that like archbishops or  patriarchs is a way for these Churches to interact as a common union  but are not ontologically necessary like a bishop. To counterbalance  that book I've mostly  been reading Erick Ybarra's blog, he's an  apologist but he's very  charitable and humble and is willing to admit  when the Orthodox have a  good point. I've also been reading random  apologetic tracts from places  like Catholic Answers and [r/Catholicism](https://old.reddit.com/r/Catholicism),  although after reading His Broken Body, most of the standard Catholic  apologetics don't hold up to me. For example, it seems pretty clear that  the famous St Cyprian quote about Peter and the Church is referring to  all bishops, not just the Bishop of Rome.

From  reading Cleenereck's book, I haven't found anything resembling  Vatican  I supremacy in the first millennium. Around the period of the   iconoclasm heresy, the East made some very strong statements about the   papacy, I'm also aware of St Maximos the Confessor's statements about   Rome. Still, when taking these quotes in their context, I'm not entirely   convinced they prove what Catholic apologists want them to prove. That   said, I'm not convinced by the ""first among equals"" rhetoric that  comes  from the East. It seems like the Bishop of Rome did hold some  real power  and authority in the Early Church. Based on my own research,  I think  something described by [Kabane52](https://kabane52.tumblr.com/post/184760073500/papal-primacy-ecumenism-and-orthodox-tradition)   is probably the most likely model for the Church, where the Pope has   real authority that can even be extrajudicial, but still doesn't fit   what is described at Vatican I &amp; II. I'm open to any evidence to the   contrary.

Although I have a  preference for traditional theology and liturgy, I  don't consider  myself a Radtrad. There's a lot I like about Vatican 2, I  don't hate  Pope Francis, I think Taylor Marshall and Co. are terrible  for the  Church right now. With that said, I am shocked and dismayed by  the  current state of the Church. Although I don't hate the Holy Father,   many of his changes like Amoris Laetitia and the Catechism revision seem   to mortally threaten the integrity of Catholic doctrine. The vast   majority of bishops and cardinals in the world seem to wholeheartedly   embrace modernism. Although I can't stand Radtrads sowing dissension in   the Church, I can't help feeling many of their analyses of what's going   on in Rome are correct. I do think Pope Francis is a liberal who is   attempting to change centuries-old teachings. Also, although I realize   the Church will always be full of saints and sinners, it's hard not to   read about scandals like McCarrick's rise and fall and not feel my faith   in the Catholic Church being the True Church shaken, especially  knowing  Pope Francis may have been aware of the situation. I realize  none of  what Francis has done is infallible, but if a Pope can change  so much  about Catholic doctrine without it rising to the level of  infallibility,  and if canon lawyers and theologians can spill so much  ink squabbling  over what infallibility even means in the first place, I  can't help  wondering what good the doctrine is?

This  is again more on a personal level, but because of my views, I've  had a  hard time feeling ""at home"" in the Catholic Church. On the one  hand, I  have TLM parishes where everyone is extremely rigid, constantly   badmouthing the Pope, believing in conspiracy theories, acting like I'm a   weirdo because I allow my wife to have a job, and other things that   turn me off, but people there at least care about practicing the Faith.   On the other hand, I have Novus Ordo parishes where people are normal,   but a lot of them don't know or care to know why they're Catholic.   Additionally, the Orthodox church near me has been very welcoming and   friendly to both me and my wife. I know I'm not going to be best friends   with everyone at that church, but so far it has been a more welcoming   place than a lot of Catholic parishes we've visited, and it just feels   like I can ideologically fit in there more rather than having to choose   between Radtrad or lukewarm Catholic. I also find that the Divine   Liturgy is more beautiful and draws me closer to God than the Latin Mass   does (I actually prefer a well-done Novus Ordo or Anglican Ordinariate   to the TLM in most cases).

I  realized my post was basically my intellectual/personal problems  with  Catholicism and not so much why I find Orthodoxy appealing. As I  said  above, there's much about the Divine Liturgy that draws me in. One  of  the things I really like about Vatican 2 was introducing the  vernacular  to the Mass. I understand all the arguments for why Latin is  used, and  I think there's merit to them, but if I'm being honest, I like  that  I'm able to understand what the priest is saying. I also like the   emphasis on the Resurrection and Second Coming that is present, which I   believe Ratzinger said was also introduced in the Novus Ordo. I know   some will tell me to attend an Eastern Catholic parish, but there isn't   one near for me nearly two hours, and there's still the matter of the   papacy not being settled.

I also  am finding Orthodox spirituality to be very beautiful. I read  St  Innocent of Alaska's book and almost couldn't put it down. I have   admired many stories of saints like Gabriel Fool for Christ. I think the   use of icons and the theology behind them is incredible. I find   Orthodox church architecture to be otherwordly in a way that I haven't   always felt in Catholic churches, even the ones in my city built before   the 20th century. I've been making a habit of saying morning and  evening  Orthodox prayers, and they've been bringing me a lot of peace. I   realize a lot of this is pretty subjective, and I'm open to  criticisms. I  just wanted to explain some of the positive reasons I'm  looking at  Orthodoxy rather than just be one of those people who  converts because  they're mad at Pope Francis but still want the  Eucharist.

That's a long post and  kind of rambling, but I'd be interested in hearing what people here have  to say, and I'd appreciate any prayers you could throw my way.",OrthodoxChristianity

I think I'm starting to realize why I am attracted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. What do you think of my reasoning?,Mysterylover90s,1596734420,"So my Christian faith has always been important to me. I was raised Catholic, and when I went to college, I was surrounded by people who were not only not Christian, but were also hostile to the Christian faith. Even though the family I came from were staunch Democrats, I became attracted to certain politicians, such as Ted Cruz, because I saw them as populists defending Christianity at a time when Christianity was under attack in the US.

Despite my initial admiration for Cruz, I remember that he was booed off the stage at a conference called ""In Defense of Christians,"" which was a conference to raise awareness for the plight of Christians of the Middle East, because he made a few pro-Israel comments ([https://time.com/3328063/ted-cruz-booed-israel-christian-middle-east/](https://time.com/3328063/ted-cruz-booed-israel-christian-middle-east/)). I remember I was very confused by this, and I thought, ""why would Christians of the Middle East dislike Israel when they are under attack by Islam?"" I would get my answer a few years later. **I'm not trying to get too political here, it is just I want to give some context for my faith journey.**

Two years later, I became more aware of the plight of Christians in the Middle East, and I did more research on it, and I came to realize that there was a rich Christian tradition in the Middle East, and bad Western policy, Western neglect, and Western ignorance had caused the Christians of the Middle East a lot of suffering. I then remembered the Ted Cruz incident at In Defense of Christians, and wanted to do more research on that, to see how it tied into the plight of MENA Christians. The supposedly pro-Christian, right-wing Breitbart attacked these Middle Eastern Christians as terrorist supporters, and failed to discuss why these Christians might dislike Israel ([https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/09/11/in-defense-of-christians-summit-features-supporters-of-hezbollah/](https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/09/11/in-defense-of-christians-summit-features-supporters-of-hezbollah/)).

Now it was not only Western political pundits attacking Middle Eastern Christians, but also Western Christian religious leaders. For example, the former Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, Patriarch Laham, was attacked by a Vatican insider in 2012 when he called for Pope Benedict to recognize Palestine as a state (see link to Bretibart article above for this info), and he was also attacked by a prominent French Catholic Bishop because he supported the Syrian government in the Syrian Civil War ([http://orientale-lumen.blogspot.com/2013/09/](http://orientale-lumen.blogspot.com/2013/09/)). This French Bishop supported airstrikes against the Syrian government, and failed to listen to Patriarch Laham, who told the French Bishop that the people fighting against the Syrian government were killing Christians, destroying their Churches, and were forcing them to leave Syria.

Given that Patriarch Laham lives in Syria, who was this French Bishop to judge him about what was going on in Syria? **You may be asking right now, how is this relevant to my faith journey?** Well lately, I have been discerning if I should be Catholic or Orthodox, and I really am questioning the doctrine of Papal supremacy and infallibility. I came across this passage on wikipedia that discusses some critiques of Papal supremacy:

The [Council of Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Carthage_(419)) (419): [Saint Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Augustine) and [Saint Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Aurelius) in this council condemned [Pope Zosimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Zosimus) for interfering with the African Church's jurisdiction by falsifying the text of Canon 5 of the [**First Council of Nicaea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea). They further warned Pope Zosimus, and later [Pope Celestine I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Celestine_I), not to ""introduce the empty pride of the world into the Church of Christ"" and to ""keep their Roman noses out of African affairs"".[\[114\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_primacy#cite_note-PSchwerin4-5-121)[\[115\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_primacy#cite_note-122)[\[116\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_primacy#cite_note-123) The Council ruled that no bishop may call himself ""Prince of Bishops"" or ""Supreme Bishop"" or any other title which suggests *Supremacy* (Canon 39). It also ruled that if any of the African clergy dared to appeal to Rome, ""the same was *ipso facto* cast out of the clergy"". (Canon 34)[\[114\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_primacy#cite_note-PSchwerin4-5-121)[\[117\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_primacy#cite_note-124)"" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal\_primacy#:\~:text=Papal%20primacy%2C%20also%20known%20as,bishops%20and%20their%20episcopal%20sees.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_primacy#:~:text=Papal%20primacy%2C%20also%20known%20as,bishops%20and%20their%20episcopal%20sees.)).

After reading this, I remembered the Syrian situation I read about, and I thought, who are people in the Vatican and France to tell a Syrian Patriarch how to do his job? I think this sums up why I am attracted to Orthodoxy, given that Western Christianity, to include Roman Catholicism, has failed Christians in many parts of the World.

Do you think my reasoning for being attracted to Orthodoxy is legitimate?",OrthodoxChristianity
Need some help,MisterFistFister,1596733376,"I wanna start off with saying that I'll go to the nearest Church and talk with someone there but my vocal folds are damaged so I thought this will give me a general idea for now until I can talk properly.

I'll skip details here but you can still pick up my general story. 

I was baptised as an infant in an Orthodox Church but I never really cared too much to be completely honest. We did go to Church as a family probably once a month. If I remember correctly I only fasted the last week of the Great Fast.

Last year I went into a little bit of an Eastern thought, I was meditating and wanted to do some potentially dangerous stuff like astral projection (but I never succeeded).

Then I was introduced to, unfortunately, Protestant views and a lot of conspiracy theories that just frankly made me depressed. 

I thought that Christianity is the same West and East and I just couldn't take it anymore and just said all of this is just BS why is it so divisive. I struggled with a lot of questions so I just went back to meditating and started watching some toxic atheists like Matt Dillahunty who for the most case battles Bible literalists and a completely messed up version of God, I *don't* recommend you to check my post/comment history. Let's just say I blasphemed an already-blasphemed version of God/Christianity lol.

I also met a lady who knew all what I was feeling. She told me ""You're afraid of Hell but you're in it already"" and quoted Jesus ""blessed are those who have not seen but believe"". I was in complete despair, of faith, of hope, of everything really.

I see the importance of asceticism, prayer, watchfulness, Orthodoxy seems to have literally everything I've been searching for and on top of it - is the true Christianity.

I listened to Monk Arseniye from Serbia (I'm from North Macedonia so I understand Serbian), his story of his youth and his rock n roll/drug days. It absolutely touched me. Reflecting on it, I've always been a kid who has seen past government bullshit, almost any kind of bullshit, and legit I've always felt like I never fit in this generation. When all of my friends cared for how many likes they got on Facebook, I was intrigued by art, history and science, and later on religion as well. Unfortunately, I also saw that I was also a bit of a douchebag and let pride overtake me in my teenage years (which ironically just made me more anxious) and saw a lot of stuff as competition (I used to be really good at school and also at calisthenics/gymnastics).

I guess I just had to go through all of this to end up here. So I wanna ask what would a general timeline be for the future in terms of going to Church? Do I need to get baptised again? Do I tell a priest my whole story and go on from there? I'm still quite new regarding Orthodoxy.

Anyway, thanks for reading my story.",OrthodoxChristianity

"Orthodox Take on ""American Gospel""",haxafax,1596728067,"Hi all! I'm technically a Protestant, but I began a journey of deconstruction around 2012 that made me see God in a different light without realizing that many of my new ""revelations"" ended up being standard Eastern Orthodox Christianity (rejection of penal substitutionary atonement, rejection of sola Scriptura, the idea that God unified us with him in the incarnation as St. Athanasius said ""He became man that we might become deified"", etc.) I only just recently discovered the Eastern Church and find myself way more in line with her teachings and after reading ""Rock and Sand"" by Fr. Josiah Trenham I am that much more convinced I've missed something over the years.

Having said all this, I wanted to hear Orthodox Christian's perspective on the movie ""American Gospel"" - if you haven't seen it, it's essentially a Reformed Calvinist rebuttal of the ""health, wealth, and prosperity gospel"" they claim is being toted by Joel Osteen, Benny Hinn, Todd White, etc.

I think there was valid criticism in the documentary, but I found it ironic that they essentially replace one American gospel for another ""American"" gospel by rejecting the Western ""Prosperity Gospel"" version of the gospel and embracing the Western Calvinist version of the gospel.

Can you guys help bring awareness to the genocide of Orthodox Christian in Ethiopia,Applecatt12,1596722627,"This  began with the killing of the popular Oromo musician Haacaaluu Hundeessaa earlier in July.His murder unleashed the terror on non-ormo ethnic communities by Ormo radicals. These were the most horrific days for Christians in the Oromo region. There are different factions in the region. Some are ethno-nationalist and others are religious. The majority of those who got killed in a brutal way (beheaded and mutilated) are Orthodox Christian of Amhara Ethnicity. The other targets were Gurage, Wolayita, Tigreans, and Gammo ethnicities. No governmental forces were present in the scene. The murders were armed with knives and guns. Nobody stopped nor interfered. After the massacre, government soldiers are deployed. Archbishop Abune Henok, Primate of the diocese of West Arsi (located in the Oromo region) stated that Orthodox Christians were purposefully targeted and killed. The attack was not just ethnic-based, but it was presented in that manner. The pre-planned attack by radicals killed more than 239 Orthodox Christians. More than 3362 Orthodox Christians were displaced. Many Orthodox Christians schools, clinics, entrepreneurial ventures, vehicles were also destroyed, according to Archbishop Henok. Radical Ormo Islamist Jawar Mohammed and his gang have been terrorizing Non-Ormo communities, especially Orthodox Christians.The government hasn’t really done anything about this and the prime minister hasn’t even acknowledged that this is happening. They’re also silencing journalists who interview families who have been affected.In order to bring attention this because so far the world isn’t talking about how people are getting murdered instead they’re praising the protesters for fighting for their freedom some people on Twitter have been using the  #EthinicCleansingInOrmoia and I was hoping you guys would help to get it to trending so that more people can become aware of what’s happening.Lastly please pray for us.",OrthodoxChristianity

Who does The Morning Star refer to in The Old and New Testament?,CanadianEthos,1596682695,"**Part 1**

Many religious syncretists, and occultists, would have us believe that the morning star exclusively refers to Lucifer. And that all 10 persons listed below in the *Mythology and theology section* from Wikipedia are one in the same entity.  

**From a Christian Perspective**

The Gospels and The Old Testament are not open to interpretation. It requires years of study under a proper Christian theologian or priest, to fully understand the meaning of scripture. Unfortunately many people believe they can interpret God's Word as they please. This is a delusion of pride, it is false humility. Prelest a result of **Fantasia.** False humility (pride) resides in the heart and mind, hidden from the world. It strengthens itself through a false narrative. The spiritual deception many people are experiencing, consist of a synthesis of the following

1. A lack of knowledge of scriptural interpretation as taught by a proper Orthodox Christian Theologian via a seminary or through a spiritual father or spiritual mother.
2. Too much time allowing ourselves to be distracted on social media, TV, film and not enough time spent on prayer.
3. A lack of basic critical thinking skills
4. The influence of the occult manifested through mass media, interconnecting symbols and geometric patterns to make sense of the world. This is a form of religious syncretism which leads to heretical Christian based dispensationalism as taught by many new ministries.. There are hundreds of these websites online.

A quote from the TV series EVIL Season 1 Episode 3 - **God draws in straight lines. The devil draws in puzzles and anagrams. Father Amara.** This is not to be confused with the old saying, “God can draw a straight line with a crooked stick.”

&gt;*The Bible code (Hebrew: הצופן התנ""כי‎, hatzofen hatanachi), also known as the Torah code, is a purported set of* ***secret messages encoded*** *within the Hebrew text of the Torah. This hidden code has been described as a method by which specific letters from the text can be selected to reveal an otherwise obscured message.*

**Note:** Interconnected thinking is nothing more than an outline of thought. It's not some sort of secret way of thinking. Unfortunately the people who stumble onto this type of thinking, erroneously believe that it helps them to miraculously open the mind to divine supernatural sources. We see this in popular culture through books like *The Doors of Perception* by Aldous Huxley.

**Bible Verses About The** **Morning** **Star**

**Job 38:7** \- “When the **morning** **stars** **sang together**, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?” King James Version (KJV)  **Comment**: In The Old Testament we read in The Book of Job 38:7 (KJV) .The verse mentions morning stars in the plural. And just as there are thousands of different stars visible to the naked eye, there are at least two or more morning stars. 

**Revelation 2:28** \- 25 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come. 26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: 27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. 28 And I will give him the **morning** **star**. 29 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

**Revelation 22:16** \- ""I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and **morning** **star**.” King James Version (KJV)

**Isaiah Chapter 14 -** 12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, **son of the** **morning**! \[how\] art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! 13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. 15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

**Comment:** There have been many morning stars as there have been evening stars. Could it be that morning stars or evening stars refers to celestial beings?

**Morning** **Star** **(may not be a complete listing)** \- From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Do you think the founding of the Churches in India and Ethiopia refutes the Catholic Church's argument that the Papacy and Rome is Supreme?,Mysterylover90s,1596643979,"So, after Pentecost, the Apostles went to different places to spread the good news. Catholics teach that since Peter was the head apostle, everyone always has to follow whatever the successor of Peter said (although it is debatable of who Peter's official successor was, as Peter set up Churches in both Antioch and Rome). If Jesus wanted all Christians to follow whatever the Bishop of Rome says, why didn't the Apostles travel around the world together spreading the good news, with Peter leading all of them. St. Thomas went all the way to India, thousands of miles away from Rome. How was the Church supposed to be united under Rome when they were setting up churches in India? 

Also, when Philip baptized the Ethiopian man, he did not say, ""since Peter's the infallible head, you have to check in with him before you spread the good news to other Ethiopian people."" Phillip just let the man go on his way. If Peter was as powerful as the Catholic Church says he was, wouldn't Phillip have had to check in with him before baptizing people? The fact all of the Apostles were not evangelizing together under Peter makes me skeptical of the idea that we all have to be subordinate to the Bishop of Rome.

Either way, no overarching malevolent figure exists for us. It just seems sort of pointless to me. If God is omnipotent, then the whole goal of a hypothetical Satan isn't going to work.

A resident Protestant here. I always enjoy reading your posts, though I don’t always agree with your Theology (I’m sort of a theologian-I’m studying for a master’s of Divinity in the Reformed church); and I LOVE a lot of Orthodox music.

I have a question regarding the theology behind one of your liturgical songs; the Holy Thursday Antiphon has lyrics like these:


Today is suspended upon the tree 

who suspended the land upon the waters.

A crown of thorns crowns him

Who is the king of the angels.

He is wrapped about with the purple of mockery

Who wrapped the heavens with clouds.

He received my deeds

He who freed Adam in the Jordan

He is transfixed with pains 

Who is the son of the virgin

We worship thy passion, oh Christ

Show us also thy glorious resurrection.

Biblical Allegories,ManonFire63,1596553845,"I have been working on Biblical Allegories.  How does the following hold up in Orthodox Christianity?  Was I on point?  

# Applying Allegorical Interpretation of The Bible - Living Dead

Below is Hellinistic Philosopher, and early Christian Origen's wiki on his view of Allegorical Interpretation of the Bible.

Allegorical interpretation of scripture

&gt;According  to Origen, there are two kinds of Biblical literature, which are found  in both the Old and New Testaments: historia (""history, or narrative"")  and nomothesia (""legislation or ethical prescription"").\[145\] Origen  expressly states that the Old and New Testaments should be read together  and according to the same rules.\[147\] Origen further taught that there  were three different ways in which passages of scripture could be  interpreted.\[147\]\[30\] The ""flesh"" was the literal, historical  interpretation of the passage;\[147\]\[30\] the ""soul"" was the moral message  behind the passage;\[147\]\[30\] and the ""spirit"" was the eternal,  incorporeal reality that the passage conveyed.\[147\]\[30\] In Origen's  exegesis, the Book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs  represent perfect examples of the bodily, soulful, and spiritual  components of scripture respectively.\[148\]  
Origen  saw the ""spiritual"" interpretation as the deepest and most important  meaning of the text\[148\] and taught that some passages held no literal  meaning at all and that their meanings were purely allegorical.\[148\]  Nonetheless, he stressed that ""the passages which are historically true  are far more numerous than those which are composed with purely  spiritual meanings.""\[148\] Origen noticed that the accounts of Jesus's  life in the four canonical gospels contain irreconcilable  contradictions,\[149\]\[150\]\[151\] but he argued that these contradictions  did not undermine the spiritual meanings of the passages in  question.\[150\]\[151\] Origen's idea of a twofold creation was based on an  allegorical interpretation of the creation story found in the first two  chapters of the Book of Genesis.\[129\] The first creation, described in  Genesis 1:26, was the creation of the primeval spirits,\[152\] who are  made ""in the image of God"" and are therefore incorporeal like Him;\[152\]  the second creation described in Genesis 2:7 is when the human souls are  given ethereal, spiritual bodies\[153\] and the description in Genesis  3:21 of God clothing Adam and Eve in ""tunics of skin"" refers to the  transformation of these spiritual bodies into corporeal ones.\[152\] Thus,  each phase represents a degradation from the original state of  incorporeal holiness.\[152\][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen)

Origen  wrote a lot, and I don't know that I agree with him on everything he  wrote, we are focusing on Allegorical Interpretation.  Again, nothing  else he wrote.  Just Allegorical Interpretation.

The  Bible asserts Truth capitol T. Various Words, Phrases, Ideas, and/or  Concepts, things, in the Bible, carry meaning and Truth. There is a  particular way to look at them.

* Given God and the Spiritual, God has Law.
* Given God has Law, God has been working in particular ways.
* The Spiritual is other dimensional and complex. Allegories and Parables have been used to describe complex things.

**The Church as God's Wife**

In  the Old Testament Israel or Jerusalem was like God's Wife. The Song of  Songs is said to be in the Bible as a display of God's Love for Israel.  In Ezekiel 23, and many of the Prophetic Books, Israel or Judah are  often referenced as God's wife or love. In the New Testament, The Church  is like God's Bride.

*Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.* Ephesians 5:25

Is  Israel more of a Virgin Israel or a Harlot Ezekiel 23? In Revelations  17 there is a Great Prostitute. Are the Nations drunk on her wine?

These  Allegories have cause and effect relationship with real world or  physical things. Using these Allegories as lead by The Holy Ghost and  The Lord Jesus Christ, someone may be able to explain various happenings  in the world.

In Ezekiel 37,  there is The Valley of the Dry Bones. In the Valley of the Dry bones  there were ""Living Dead People."" People who were in their graves. God  gave them form. He breathed life into them. The wages of sin are death.  How did they become dead? Sin and unrepentance to God. God Almighty, God  of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob   is not of the dead but God of the living.  He is the living God.  He is an Awesome God. Someone in sin may be like  a living dead person or a zombie. Reading the signs of times, the  Spiritual Allegory that has been most often used is ""Zombie Apocalypse""  or something similar to. Rob Zombie sang ""Living Dead Girl."" A sinner  may be like zombie. Some of them work to bite like a snake bite, bite  others, bite them and lead them into sin as well, similar to Eve with  Adam? The wages of sin are death.

God gave me three videos to play one after the other, in order, to express something for him:

&gt;[""Regulator.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nPXBeGp6d4)  
In Ezekiel 23, Israel and Judah were AWOL Nations.  
[""Sail""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgIqecROs5M)  
The  righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; the devout are taken  away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be  spared from evil. (Isaiah 57:1)  
[""Rapture of Riddley Walker""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeP6yVs60aQ)

Some Bible verses I referenced:

Romans 6:23

Luke 20:38

These  Allegories work in particular ways and have particular meaning. Someone  giving them wrong may be off. He may be a false prophet. Beware.  Someone centered on God working to build God's Kingdom will find these  Allegories useful in his service to God.",OrthodoxChristianity

"“I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.“",mellifiedmoon,1596504724,"Two years ago, I was existing in darkness. I had long been laying beneath juniper branches. Even in the dark, though, I could sense I was being summoned by a light. So I followed blindly. I picked up my life and followed this light with nothing but desperation driving me. At the end of the path was a tiny church house sign painted with a cross design I had never seen. It was there I awoke to cake and water and was told to “Arise and eat!” My world from then on was flooded with light. Unceasing, unrelenting, soft light. 

I have stepped out of this light and hidden again where it is cold and hatefully dark. I left behind the love of church mothers and fathers and I haven’t spoken to them in a year. I left as a catechumen. I left behind the dying. I left behind friends with inner sickness. I left them in silence. I just hid. There is a current of thought that I have buried deep within me but it whispers every day to me to arise and eat but I just keep starving. I am spiritually sick. I feel have irreparably wounded those in the church who I abandoned. I have no answers as to how I could or why I would do such a thing. I am a coward who feels unworthy of a God’s light and a church’s love. I just wanted to let you all know how sorry I am and how eaten up I am every hour over this. 

I moved 10 hours away from that first little Orthodox Church on the hill. And who did I find? The church. There are few Western Rite churches out this way so it was a miracle for me. It took me months to go. I sobbed the whole time. The Father knew the names of those in the parish I left behind and I could not handle hearing their names spoken. I never went back, but now I think about them, too, every hour. Every hour!! And yet......I am still hiding in the dark. I do not know what is wrong with me but it is making an incredibly sick soul out of me. I feel emaciated and embarrassed over my lunatic insistence on suffering alone. Please pray for lost souls and please pray for the light of churches that are beacons to lost souls. Thank you all for the prayers that led me to be found 2 years ago.

In modern Orthodoxy in the US the prohibition on blood seems strong- my theory being that most Americans don't consume much blood anyways so we say to follow it; but it would seem strange for the prohibition to be in force in places where blood as food is common.  I don't believe that eating blood could have been regarded as an excommunicatable offense in a 95% Orthodox country where every butcher shop sells blood sausage.

How does this differ from the catholics? Correct me if I'm wrong, but according to them you can NOT alter the fate of the deceased, only minimize the deceased's soul in purgatory?

Is God going to restore perfection?,Valetic,1596376767,"I’m basically coming out of the box of western Christianity where there’s all this stuff about the second coming and revelations being fulfilled and whatnot. But I’m not sure where you guys stand. I’m really interested in Eastern Orthodox lately.

So is Jesus coming back? And if not, what are we doing here? Why is the world still going on this way without anything else to do with God other than what we have in religions today? It used to be every 200-500 years God would show up, in the OT, but since Jesus it’s just nothing.

I’m not sure where you guys stand though as far as this all goes though, my thought was that Christ is coming back one day, and in the mean time I will live and die and go to heaven and maybe come back with Him at the resurrection. Not sure any more, because there are so many different interpretations of the apocalyptic literatures and the words jesus and the apostles used.

I just don’t understand the point if God doesn’t have a plan to restore humanity to perfection and reconcile humanity with Himself perfectly and in the full fellowship and presence of Himself. I don’t understand what we are doing here any more then..",OrthodoxChristianity

Question about prayers,Down_With_The_King,1596346247,"I am looking into getting a prayer book that is more convenient to use and better structured than the one I've been using for the past ~6 years. Incidentally, the prayer book I want to get is the one I already gifted to my mother some time ago. Here is the table of content:

- Morning prayer rule

- Evening prayer rule

- Morning prayer rule (simplified)

- Evening prayer rule (simplified)

- Office of preparation for holy communion

- Prayers before holy communion

- Paraklesis to the Theotokos

- Canon to Jesus Christ

- Akathist to Jesus Christ

- Canon of the akathist to the Theotokos

- Akathist to the Theotokos

- Stanza to our guardian angel

So, here's my question. *What* do I do with the latter half of these? I know the Paraklesis is to be prayed everyday during the Dormition Fast, but are there other occasions when it should be prayed? And what about the canons, akathists and stanza? Are there any particular occasions to pray them? If it is simply a case of ""if you instantly desire to pray Jesus or Mary or your guardian angel, you can use this"", then what is the difference between a canon, an akathist, and a stanza, and which one should be prayed for what?

Maybe this is ""ask your priest"" territory, but surely I don't need to bother my priest about something as common as using a prayer book, and he is not available anyway.",OrthodoxChristianity

More specifically, I was interested in understanding exactly what exactly the orthodox view ""The Church"" as (a communion of bishops, of belief?), what the primacy of the *primus Inter pares* entails, how the church has historically viewed predestination (ie, is it closest semi-pelagians, augustinianism, molinism, thomism, etc) astuff like that.

"Mircea Eliade, the Romanian historian and inventor of comparative religion on the early church--surprisingly very orthodox.",georglukacs,1596248658,"
As we have already said, Christian theology, articulated during the Gnostic crisis of the second century, is essentially characterized by its fidelity to the Old Testament. Irenaeus, one of the earliest and most important Christian theologians, interprets the Redemption-that is, the Incarnation of Jesus Christ-as the continuation and completion of the work begun with the creation of Adam but obstructed by the Fall. Christ recapitulates the existential trajectory of Adam in order to deliver humanity from the consequences of sin. However, while Adam is  the prototype of fallen humanity, doomed to death, Christ is the creator and exemplary model of a new humanity, blessed by the promise of immortality. Irenaeus seeks-and finds-antithetical parallels between Adam and Christ: the first was created from virgin soil, Christ is  born of a  virgin; Adam disobeys by eating the fruit of the forbidden tree, Christ obeys by allowing himself to be sacrificed on the tree of the Cross, etc.



The doctrine of recapitulation can be interpreted as a twofold effort to assimilate, on the one hand, the biblical revelation in its totality and, on the other hand, to justify the Incarnation as the completion of the same revelation. The first structures of the sacred calendar, i.e., of liturgical time, continue Jewish institutions; but there is  always the christological novum. Justin calls Sunday ""the first day,"" connecting it  at once with the Resurrection and with the creation of the world. This effort to emphasize the universality of the Christian message by associating it with the sacred history of Israel-the one truly universal history-is made in parallel with the effort to assimilate Greek philosophy. The theology of the Logos-more precisely, the mystery of its Incarnation-gives speculation admittance to perspectives that were inaccessible within the horizon of the Old Testament. But this daring innovation was not without its dangers. Docetism, one of the earliest heresies, which was Gnostic in origin and structure, dramatically illustrates the resistance against the idea of the Incarnation. For the Docetists (the name comes from the Greek verb dokeo, ""to seem,"" ""to appear""), the Redeemer could not accept the humiliation of be-coming incarnate and suffering on the Cross; according to them, Christ seemed to be a man because he had put on an appearance of the human form. In other words, the passion and death were suffered by someone else (the man Jesus or Simon of Cyrene). 

Yet the Fathers were right in fiercely defending the dogma of the Incarnation. From the point of view of the history of religions, the Incarnation represents the last and most perfect hierophany: God completely incarnated himself in a human being both concrete and historical (that is, active in a well-defined and irreversible historical temporality) without thereby confining himself to his body (since the Son is consubstantial with the Father). It could even be said that the kenosis of Jesus Christ not only constitutes the crowning of all the hierophanies accomplished from the beginning of time but also justifies them, that is, proves their validity. To accept the possibility of the Absolute becoming incarnate in a historical person is  at the same time to recognize the validity of the universal dialectic of the sacred; in other words, it  is to recognize that the countless pre-Christian generations were not victims of an illusion when they proclaimed the presence of the sacred, i.e., of the divine, in the objects and rhythms of the cosmos.

Veneration of the Theotokos?,registerednurse1995,1596240558,"So my question is a serious one... Seeing as the Dormition fast begins tomorrow, I have a question about the Theotokos.

I have been studying Orthodoxy (currently Pentecostal) for a few months now, and one of the biggest hurdles is the Theotokos, as you can imagine. I have not had trouble accepting her perpetual virginity. In fact, I am very drawn to her, and I have been praying to her along with the Jesus Prayer and various other prayers. I feel very comforted when I pray ""Most Holy Lady Theotokos, save me."" However, my Pentecostal upbringing is making it difficult for me to become completely settled with the idea of seeing the Virgin Mary as more than just a bodily vessel.

Let's Talk about NSFW,aletheia,1596208960,"Some users may have have noticed a recent bot experiment focused on channeling sexual
conversations to NSFW submissions and disallowing a lot of sexually themed content in
unmarked submissions. Some users may have also noticed some inconsistency in the
application of these rules. I want to talk about the motivation behind this bot
change, and how we plan to make things more consistent. 

The motivation for this change, or the solidification of it, came from a
submission not long ago from ostensibly 14 year old gay boy posting to this
subreddit about gay/sexual topics. That submission got removed for 
""It's sexual or suggestive content involving minors."" This got us thinking
about how freely we talk about sexuality out in the open, in front of untold
numbers of minors. I don't know about you, but this makes us rather uncomfortable.
We do understand, of course, that a tag does not actually stop a 14 year old 
from viewing these threads, but it does mean we've taken the only step we 
can take with the tools available to us.

Beyond this, the subreddit has had both 
[gay ethics](https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/wiki/faq#wiki_what_are_orthodox_positions_on_marriage.2C_sex.2C_and.2For_same_sex_attractions.3F)
and
[sexual sin](https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/wiki/faq#wiki_i_masturbated_.28or_committed_some_other_sexual_sin.29_and_am_about_to_talk_about_it_in_front_of_strangers_on_the_internet._what_should_i_do.3F)
on the dead horse list for years. This has largely gone unread, unheeded, and unenforced.
Non-enforcement has mainly been born out of the fact that the Internet, for some reason,
is a never-ending flood of sex and moderating that through removal is impractical and removing 
support submissions because they involve sexuality seems to be more harmful than helpful.

With these factors taken together, using the bot to shunt sexual conversations behind an opt-in tag
has seemed like a good solution. However, two major problems have been encountered: inconsistency and
violating the rule of ""least surprise."" 

Let's talk about least surprise first. Users who have encountered the new bot have been surprised by
how broad the trigger is - currently it will trigger on the word ""lust"" for example. For those of us
who have browsed the web for a long time, this is a shockingly broad definition of NSFW. We will agree with anyone
on that. However, the mods only have the hammers reddit gives us and there are only two opt-in tags available to
the mods: NSFW and spoiler. NSFW was selected because spoiler would be an even more surprising label to have applied.

Regarding inconsistency, right now ""lust"" will trigger the bot, but not ""gay"" or ""lesbian"" or ""celibate."" This is mainly
a function of testing the concept. We did not want to have people seeking support to feel
immediately punished. However, the experiment seems to be working rather well and we will work to improve consistency.

If users have any suggestions for opt-in, or of you think spoiler is a better way to go, please let us know.

**tl;dr** It is the moderator's preference that sexual topics not be discussed on the subreddit, and that they
instead be directed to a trusted confidant in person due to the pastoral nature of these topics. However,
we recognize also that these topics can be frightening to discuss in person and that not all people have a trusted confidant.
Therefore, these topics will continue to be permitted, albeit behind the opt-in NSFW tag.",OrthodoxChristianity

Why shouldn't every mission parish be Western Rite?,ribose_carb,1596181853,"A controversial question, I know, but I really understand no reason, unless the mission parish serves a specific ethnic community, for them to be Western Rite.

The entire pupose of the Western Rite is to make Western peoples feel more at home in the Church. If a mission parish is going to reach to Western peoples, the Western Rite should be used.

""Most priests aren't familiar with the Western Rite""
They can be. Most priests that started as converts at one point weren't familiar with the Byzantine Rite, either. Father Patrick Cardine, for example, went to Byzantine liturgy for 30 years before deciding his parish to be Roman Rite.

""Converts are looking for something exotic.""
The Church shouldn't be something exotic, it should be the Church. Obviously converts are looking for something different, but, referencing Father Cardine again, the Desert Fathers said to look for Christ in your cell. For Western converts, the West is their cells, and their cell already has a rite.

""The Western Rite is underdeveloped.""
Tell that to the 70+ parishes and monasteries that practice it every day.

""Many priests were raised Byzantine and just dont want to practice an unfamiliar rite.""
The purpose of being a priest, and a mission priest, is to serve. Parishioners dont serve the priest, the priest serves the parish. Obviously there is nuance, dont twist my words.

I'm really trying to guess all the possible objections. Is there any reason I'm not thinking of? I just see no good reason why the Orthodox Church shouldn't use the familiar rite of the people It's trying to reach out to.",OrthodoxChristianity

Is humility and modesty not important just because we’re in the west and because it’s different times ? I asked about it in a group called ask an orthodox priest on Facebook and they said it’s cultural it doesn’t need to be practised and what not however everything I’ve studied shows we need to carry on the tradition and I strongly believe we have to carry the tradition , am I wrong to disagree with those bishops and priests that just throw the tradition away ?",OrthodoxChristianity

Vice as idolatry from a homily by St. John Chrysostom,Purityinthecrucible,1596129370,"""For how are we to draw others away from that idolatry if we draw not ourselves away from this?

Now do not tell me, that you do not do not worship an image of gold, but make this clear to me, that those things which gold bids you. For there are different kinds of idolatry, and one holds mammon lord, and another his belly his god, and third some other most baneful lust.

"As a former protestant and potential convert to Eastern Orthodoxy, how do I deal with my hatred of Calvinism and many other forms of Western Christianity?",jesusfollower5,1596114774,"I am a former Protestant who is strongly considering converting to Eastern Orthodoxy.  

The Protestant religion is a very broad one, and in this post I do not mean to disparage all Protestants.  There are some Protestants who I know that are full of the love, joy, peace, and care for their neighbor.  There exists some forms of Protestant Christianity that are very beautiful, and from my very limited understanding come close to approximating the truth found in Eastern Orthodoxy.

But in modern America (where I am from), such forms of Christianity seem to be in the minority.  Most believe some form of penal substitution atonement (PSA) or Anselm's satisfaction theory.  And quite frankly, if either PSA or Anselm's satisfaction theory is true, then Christianity is a degenerate, depraved, wicked, evil, and cruel religion.  It is manifestly a form of spiritual, mental, and emotional abuse.  I am incredulous at the fact that one could simultaneously believe these abhorrent theories, and maintain that God is one of infinite love.

And then there is Calvinism, which I regard as the single most evil heresy to infect Christianity.  To paraphrase David Bentley Hart (DBH): the God of Calvin is far, far worse than Satan could ever be.  The very act of creation in Calvin, is an act of evil.

I almost left Christianity altogether, but finding Eastern Orthodoxy and DBH have saved my faith.  I recognize that DBH does not represent all, or maybe even a majority of Eastern Orthodoxy, but he has made Eastern Orthodoxy a viable and attractive option for me. 

Theories like PSA, Anselm's satisfaction theory, and Calvinism deserve to be condemned.  But how do I hate the theories without hating the people that hold them?  I honestly think that many people do believe what they think they believe.  They don't *really believe* that on one hand God is one of infinite love, and on the other requires sadistic acts of violence for appeasement.  I am not sure that Calvinists *really believe*, that God has predestined cancer, tsunamis, and the holocaust.  On the other hand, if I am completely honest, there is a part of me that feels adherents to these theories are to some extent moral cretins.  

I feel that I am in a double bind.  On one hand, I feel obliged to hate these theories in the way that I am obliged to hate racism and misogyny.  At some point, I think evil needs to be called out for what it really is, and this is one of the reasons why I love DBH's writings.  But on the other hand, I don't want to be consumed by hatred.  I am already feeling its corrosive effects, and I don't want to be in bondage to it.  Furthermore, we follow one who calls us to love our enemies and who calls the merciful blessed.  I don't want to be like the unforgiving servant.  Lord have mercy on me.

How can I be merciful to my brothers and sisters who believe these theories, while hating the theories themselves?  And how am I to deal with my brothers and sisters who promulgate these destructive theories, and claim that they are preserving the true faith?  As mentioned above, at some point evil needs to be called out for what it is.  But how do I do that without hating the person promoting evil?

An respectful objection to Christianity - specifically eschatology,ghobs99,1596039488,"For a long while I have been interested in Christianity as a world view and specifically Orthodoxy. Being that I’m someone who desires for there to be moral purpose and meaning to make the world a better place, I actually agree with a whole lot of Christian ethics, so much so that when I discuss what I value with people in conversation (friends, colleagues etc.) they ask whether I’m religious. However, whilst sharing many areas of agreements with Christianity, there have been many things that I have found disagreeable and hard to reconcile myself with regarding certain doctrines, therefore preventing me from fully being a Christian. The one doctrine in particular that has been hardest for me to accept is the whole eschatological, end-times element. What attracted me to Christianity in the first place was a desire for moral purpose and the wish to make a world a better place, and there are no doubt many Christians who desire the same thing as me. But I ask what’s the point of trying to pursue moral virtues and make the world a better place if one of the   central doctrines of Christianity is that terrible things must occur to make way for the second coming of Christ? Why should we try to end things such as abortion, hyper sexualised culture, wars and famines if it is written that such things must occur to mark the return of Christ? This is why when I see Christians complain about the faults of the world we live, I always see it as a pointless complaint: why are you complaining about the terrible things of the world when it is written that such things need to occur. This element of Christianity is what I find most difficult to accept and is why I’m becoming more of a humanist in my moral outlook. I am making this post not to be confrontational, but I genuinely wish to know what Christians think of this. Have you wrestled with these questions yourselves? I’m more than happy for you to challenge my objections and have me rethink my convictions.",OrthodoxChristianity

Overcoming feeling of agnosticism and converting over?,marieeew88,1596018240,"So I made a post last week freaking out about attending my first divine liturgy. I went to it, it was amazing. And ever since the moment I got home from it I have been pouring over books about the faith. It was very moving in the least. 
 
I am really interested in converting over eventually, for now I just want to attend more and learn more about it before taking that step. Especially since I am still struggling with feelings of agnosticism. 
I have been one since about 10 years old and I'm 23. I really really want a relationship with God and the way the Orthodox approach the Bible makes complete sense logically. But I don't *feel* God. I watched a video series on YouTube the other day and remember it being mentioned that not everyone feels God in the heart but brain or something? (Pleae correct me if I'm wrong. Linked video series down below) I'm unsure about what that means entirely, but I'm hoping that maybe the more I attend divine liturgy and other services that it will come. I long for a relationship with God. 

When I mentioned this to a RC friend she suggested I remain agnostic as that is my path but that doesn't sound or feel right. I want a relationship with God in his true church. I have never been baptized or anything and I feel so wrong about it.

Do y'all have any recommendations for me gaining that relationship with God? And when I do, what are the process to becoming a convert? I have a toddler, he hasn't been baptized either , but I do not want him to miss out on a relationship with God, what could I do for him? Would he now need to wait till he becomes an adult to convert? How would that work for him?

He travelled with her to Ephesus where she died. Does anyone know why St. John did not receive the same authority in the Early Church, in terms of governance. Is it because Peter and Paul were older than him? Given the fact that he wrote one of the Gospels, and Revelation, was the beloved disciple, and taught such profound sacramental mysteries of the faith, I fail to understand why Peter and Paul have taken on such primary significance in the question of the schism with Rome, since surely the authority of the other Apostles, above all St. John, and the fact that the Mother of God was still around, counts for something?

Unique Problem Regarding Conversion,qc013330,1595984303,"Hello, friends!

I have a unique problem with my conversion status and am looking for opinions. I intend to pose this same question to the priest I’ve been inquiring with, too.

My spouse and I are life-long Protestants from Protestant families. We had been inquiring at a local church for close to a year together, and I’ve been individually for closer to two years. It’s safe to say that I’m convinced 100%.
We had intended to start attending the Orthodox Church regularly next month, after our position of leadership at our Protestant church ended on its normal term. However, my spouse’s parents decided to move far away recently. They’ll keep driving to this church, but otherwise we won’t see them hardly at all, and this is a big deal to them because we have multiple young children. It’s important to note that my father-in-law has never attended church or showed much interest in it.

My father-in-law now says he’ll start to attend our Protestant church, to see us and the kids more. We hadn’t told anyone our plan to convert, so this isn’t a reaction to that.

My concern is that it would be wrong of my family to convert, if our staying at the Protestant church would facilitate him getting to hear the gospel, even in a watered down state. I know he would not attend if we were not there.

A very interesting quote from St. John Chrysostom about man and the devil,TransitAnthem,1595980829,"“The devil,” says St John Chrysostom about the fallen angel, “‘is shameless and insolent. He attacks from below. Yet even so he often wins, but that is only because we do not try to raise ourselves to where he is powerless to wound us. For he cannot raise himself high, but creeps over the earth; and that is why the serpent is his type or image. And if God set him crawling at the beginning of things, he is all the more so now. But if you do not know what it means to attack from below, I will try to explain it to you. It means to steal upon you and master you by using low things, by means of pleasures, riches, and all that is earthly. So if the devil sees someone soaring to heaven, first he is not in a position to attack him; and second, if he does risk attacking, he soon falls, because he has not a leg to stand on. Do not be afraid of him; he has no wings. He only crawls over the earth and creeps among earthly things. So have nothing in common with earth; then there will be no need even of labor. The devil cannot fight openly, but just as a snake hides in thorns, so he mostly lurks in the delusions of wealth. If you cut out the thorns, he will soon be scared and take to flight. If you can exorcize him with divine charms, you will easily strike him. And we do have, we surely have spiritual charms: the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the power of the cross.”

Question about The Church of Antioch breaking communion with Rome,Mysterylover90s,1595948308,"So I know when the Crusades came to Antioch, John V was the Patriarch of Antioch (and Antioch had not broken communion with Rome at this point), and at first they all seemed to coexist. The Crusaders put in some Latin Bishops where there were no Greek Bishops, and Patriarch John was ok with it. But, when the Crusader prince didn't like Patriarch John, he just threw him in prison and then exiled him to Constantinople, causing John to break communion. 

I was wondering, what gave the Crusader prince permission to do this? It seems very imperialistic that the Western Crusaders just came to the Church of Antioch and just took it over, given that it was in communion with Rome at that point. How would any of the Church Councils and Church Fathers thought about this?

Common descent wouldn’t be a problem, because Adam and Eve could have been special creations of God amongst evolved life, and thus distinct. Moreover, common descent should be any more heretical than being forms from mud, anyways.

‘Randomness’ would may pose an issue if God guided evolution were random. Fortunately, it’s not.

That leaves us with one issue: The other evolved contemporaries of Adam and Eve. How I reconcile them is to say that, after the Fall, which happened as Genesis describes, all individuals born aftercare whether of biological relation or not, were conceived with an immortal human soul and the image of God.

A prayer request,zatris,1595897733,"Dear people of this sub, I ask you too keep praying for me and my girlfriend as we journey towards Orthodoxy.

Because of the pandemic we can't go to church now (either ours or the Orthodox cathedral we visited back in January), but things are sort of moving... I was the one who became interested in Orthodoxy first, read a lot and wanted to go to the Divine Liturgy, but since January my girlfriend's been doing her research and, as a result, getting more and more enthusiastic about it, to the point she's now saying we maybe should seriously consider start attending an Orthodox parish when things open up. As in, not going back to our church.

It's great in a way, but now the roles have reversed a bit and I'm the one going ""Whoa, not so fast"". I'm ~~a little~~ definitely afraid of the reaction of our families (we're all Protestant), afraid of we both going to a church where we don't know anyone, and so on. To be completely honest, I'm even somewhat afraid that things are moving because God *is* answering our prayers (and your prayers), and leading us to the Church. Like, well, that would make everything *really serious*, wouldn't it?

I don't know if I'm being completely coherent. In one hand it's even funny actually how I'm the hesitant one right now. And of course there's a lot of overthinking on my part, I guess, since most churches, Orthodox and otherwise, aren't even holding public services yet.

"From ""Greek Christianity after 1453"" by Vrasidas Karalis (Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity)",georglukacs,1595850656,"The Church needs to regain its ecclesiastical character as the ecclesia of the people; it must therefore open up and reach out to the faithful by disavowing the secular power with which it has been invested since imperial Rome and Constantinople, and redis- cover its own koinonia of the faithful. It must rediscover the tragic character of human history as a traumatic loss of innocence for every individual – and for such loss there is a collective responsibility. Within the sacramental community of the ecclesia the faithful regain collectively the pristine gaze of prelapsarian humanitas. But within the confines of historical realities the Church must open its own Christian tradition to culture and democracy, distancing itself from Constantinian ecclesiasticism, dogma- tism and ungodly hubris.
 Instead of being a volkish church based on blood and soil, which is unfortunately what it has become, the Church must rediscover its own ecumenical character, its apostolic and liberating mission. In history, it must also rediscover its middle ground between the global spiritual authority of Roman Catholicism, the religious democracy of Protestant Christianity and the political democracy of the Enlightenment; instead of demonizing each one of them and rejecting their contribution to the development of common humanity and the Christian heritage, it must boldly synthesize them, creating an open ecclesia in which clergy and laity experience their own vulnerability as conscious moments in history in a process of spiritual unfolding. Instead of using the Greek language as the sacrament itself, or the nation as the object of worship in itself, the ecclesia must create a ‘socialized individual’ within the bonds of a communio sanctorum.
The democratization of the Church will democratize the inner self, the thinking subject, and will liberate the faithful (clergy and laity) from the seductive privileges of state power in which the current Church is completely immersed. Strangely, while a theological storm has been raging throughout the Christian world since World War II, none of this has found any kind of expression in the theological discussions within the Greek Orthodox Church; on the contrary, every new Archbishop of Athens praises his Church for having maintained the ‘authentic message’ of the ‘original church’, and dismisses everything and everyone else outside their fold. (On some occasions, even the co-Orthodox Russians have not escaped some extremely derogatory comments, pre- cisely for being Russian Orthodox and not Greek.) No real engagement with the prob- lems raised by secularity and postmodernity has ever been attempted within the Church; no moral reflection, no spiritual discussion or even a reasonable intellectual debate have ever been fostered or promoted by the Church.
On the contrary, as an organization protected by the state, the Greek Orthodox Church reproduces a theological rhetoric which simply justifies its policies and actions. No self-reflective discourse is established because, according to the dominant percep- tion, there are no mistakes to admit to. While the pope was persistently asked to apolo- gise for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 by the Fourth Crusade, the Greek Orthodox Church cannot contemplate making its own apology to persecuted religious minorities in the country, or recognize the gross errors of its involvement in politics (or even of the slaughtering of all foreigners in Constantinople in 1182). While bishops come and go, all structures remain the same; and their occupants ignore their historical development and the changes they underwent in history.
Since spirituality has been reduced to liturgicalism and koinonia to ecclesiasticism, no real theological questions can arise within the mindset of the Greek Orthodox sub- jectivity. Ecclesiastical language and life reproduces all aspects of public life in the image of official power, employing the rhetoric of the empire and imposing an impoverished vocabulary of communication which simply limits the ability for self-critical reasoning. It constantly uses a kind of religious Newspeak, tending to attribute all contemporary problems to the addition of the filioque in the Creed. The Greek Orthodox Church has established and imposed a set of mis-naming strategies, which see history as dystopia and historical experience as a constant attack against the true Church of Jesus Christ, i.e., itself, or against the only Truth, which it also enshrines. Within this mentality it defines a way of living with dolce far niente as its dominant motto; by raising the divisive walls that isolated the triumphant Byzantium from Europe, it repeats the same errors and exhibits the same exclusivity even as it purports to be participating in the ecumenical dialogue. The real theological issues of historicity, corporeality, logical rearticulation of the doctrine through natural sciences, and the elaboration of faith through postmodern existential fragmentation and semantic nihilism do not even appear in the mental universe of the hierarchy, or of its closely attached theologians, who see everything in black and white polarities and as constant conspiracies against Orthodoxy.
The Greek Orthodox Church is in need of a new ecclesiology; it must see its tradition within the historical experience of the faithful by discarding the practices of a state- sponsored church, and reintroduce the concept of Christian universalism. In the world of fragmented postmodernity, it must regain its organic unity of a diverse community, fostering debates, dismantling bureaucratic overcentralization and creating social possibilities for a spiritual revival. The current situation is the grossest distortion of the eastern tradition: the Greek Orthodox Church has to be seen as another political party, not as an eschatological community; it is characterized by arrogance, secularism and a marked anti-intellectual mentality which, disguised under the false pretences of defending faith and opposing secularity, impose a mentality of intolerance, sterility and fundamentalism.
In Greece Orthodoxy has evolved into orthodoxism; or more precisely, as two young theologians have remarked about the Church of Greece:
it has become a new atypical institution: we call it ‘alternative theocracy’. It is a politically correct version of theocracy, which does not question the current rules of the democratic state, and at the same time it tries to dissociate itself from the similar, utterly autocratic cases of the Western Dark Ages or of contemporary Islam. And yet it never ceases to be bedevilled by the same mentality: the mentality of the primacy of spiritual authority over that of the secular state. (Arkadas and Mpekridakis 2001: 22)

Orthodoxy on sleeping and dreaming,Jealous-Candle,1595763043,"Hello.

&amp;#x200B;

I have issues with nightmares, sleep paralysis, and trouble falling asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had troubles falling asleep since I was little. I'm thinking about something the entire time, my brain is working like i9 processor. I try falling asleep by repeating the Jesus Prayer, but to no apparent avail. I sometimes lie in bed for 6 hours without falling asleep. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night (although I'm very tired and sleepy) and can't fall asleep again.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having frequent sleep paralysises in my sleep since 3 years ago (after I started taking psychiatric meds - I'm not taking them anymore). I've had sleep paralysis like 50 times. Usually something bad happens in my dream (a sort of nightmare) and then I realize that I'm dreaming, and I want to wake up so I can get away from it but it's like my body is frozen, disabled, with no control over the movement. Sometimes I can't move even after I open my eyes for a split second. Sometimes when I wake up it's like I'm looking through blue/yellow sunglasses (the light from the sun or the lightbulbs are painted blue/yellow). I take it this is a demonic activity?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have frequent (extremely scary and traumatic) nightmares. I think this is also some kind of demonic influence.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm already doing everyday morning and night prayers (in which there are parts for praying to God to fall asleep easly and having calm and pure sleep - in the night prayer, and thanking God for the calm and pure sleep - in the morning prayer).

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas on what to do, any suggestions? Any particular additional prayer suggestions, which are specific for this issue, or some saints which typically are known to help with this?

I'm struggling with the Atonement. How do Orthodox respond to Protestant objections to Christus Victor and the verses they use to justify PSA?,Sunday_Morning_Tomb,1595750242,"**PREFACE*

*Hello, everyone.

I am a non-denominational struggling Christian (technically grew up Coptic Orthodox but was never baptized) who is attempting to come to an understanding of the Atonement of Jesus on the Cross. Because of this, I would greatly appreciate Orthodox answers to the following objections we see from those in Reformed Theology.

------------------

I should clarify - none of the below are my own views, but what I see brought up in Protestant circles.

**1) Christus Victor is correct, but inadequate**

As you're all likely aware, the Protestant view of the Atonement doesn't *deny* the Christus Victor model, but instead holds it as complimentary to PSA, or Penal Substitutionary Atonement. They agree that Christ conquers death and sin, but that CV cannot make sense without PSA.

The assertion is that Christus Victor isn't really a theory of *how* the Atonement is achieved, but rather that it's one of the *end results of it*. It describes the What, but not the How. It tells us nothing about how Christ’s death served to expiate sin and reconcile us God. In this vein, CV, while valid, is incomplete *on it's own*.

Another criticism I've read is that CV focuses too much on the consequences of sin, principally death, and overcoming Satan  -rather than on sin itself and its expiation.

**2) Penal Substitution can be found in some of the Church Fathers**

The charge here, is that deniers of PSA distort the meanings of PSA-central words when claiming that the Church Fathers never upheld it. Because words change across a) time and b) languages, they can say that no one articulated PSA because it doesn't LOOK like it does in its current form. But PSA has been held throughout the ages &amp; languages, it just looks different in Justin Martyr, Cyril, Hilary of Poiters, etc. than it does in modern thinkers in Reformed circles like RC Sproul or Piper today.

PSA originality advocates also point to the influence Augustine's work had on John Calvin in the 16th century.

**3) Verses**

They'll often cite Colossians 2:13-15 as proof of Penal Substition being complimentary to Christus Victor (but CV being secondary in importance to PSA)

&gt;""**And you, who were dead in your trespasses** and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.""

Isaiah 53:5

&gt;""But he was **pierced for our transgressions**, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.""

Romans 3:25-26

&gt;""God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement,[a] through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, **because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished**— he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus"".

Proverbs 11:21

&gt;""Be sure of this: **The wicked will not go unpunished**, but those who are righteous will go free.""

^ That last one more broadly is used to emphasize God's dual nature of loving *and just*. He demands for sins to be meet with His wrath.

I need help with a lot of this.

Islam has overtaken nearly the entire Eastern Roman Empire and subjugated, killed, or enslaved everyone living in this part of the world.

Furthermore, most Muslims today do not know the truth about how their grandparents had converted; they're given a false history by Muslim clerics about converting to Islam in multitudes *willingly* because it is the one true faith.

NOTES FROM AFRICA: HAGIA SOPHIA A PLACE OF ENCOUNTER OR EXCLUSION? by Metropolitan Petros of Accra,anastasiawasblack,1595696309,,OrthodoxChristianity
A question on Christianity impossible ethic,ShadowOfAFormerSelf,1595695454,"Hi everyone, a question from a baptised Catholic (that's easy, they wash our baby head in our infancy) turned agnostic turned atheist turned Buddhist. 
I'm posting this here because I don't know Orthodoxy and would never trust a protestant, in particular on an American social network. No offence to them, but I don't like what I know of that confusing world. 

My problem is, I can't understand how the yoke of Jesus can be ""easy"". A true Christian is required to walk his pact and be perfect as him. The moral requests are extreme, to put it mildly. In Buddhism, the question of a creator God is dropped. You have to be good not because you are made in the image of God, but because the karma works in such a way that every action has consequences: but you don't have to sacrifice yourself in an act of blind faith, and no one will punish you if you don't meet a God's expectations; no game of hide and seek, no leap into the unknown. Furthermore, the mind is not considered to be a teathre of a perennial war beetween forces of good and evil. Bad thinking come from ignorance, delusions and craving; now, there is no actual explanations on way we are so much problematic as a specie, it is enough to know that only by abandon our false sense of self and closing our mind to desideres one can escape our destiny of sufference. 

As a complicated person, I can't live a live that is like walking on eggs where every bad steps can condemn you to an eternity of hell beyond the darkest imaginations. That sounds insane to me, that is why I was teached all my life. 

Now, the reasons why I can't drop this religion completely is because the gospels speak to me. Christ can't be just a human creation. No humans from ancient times could have had the reasons and the capacity to create such a everlasting character that shattered every human conventions if he wasn't based on a true person. 

But how, how can I be judged as him?! I would prefer nothingness to that.

I know there are supposed prophecies of consecrating Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which is exclusively a Catholic devotion, but as far as I understand Russia is almost pure Orthodox and I have trouble understanding it. While private apparitions and visions aren't ""required"" to be believed, they're a massive part of traditional Catholic thought and private life. It just feels weird that only the Catholic Church seems to have these apparitions of Mary, but then again I'm not sure if the Orthodox have them either.",OrthodoxChristianity

"Pray for me brothers and sisters, I need your help.",MinatoArysato,1595597165,"Hello everyone, i'm an American teenage boy who was a Protestant for almost all his life (Baptist and Methodist). Around a year and a half ago, I had begun going to therapy. At that time I was spiritually lost, I had dealt with bad depression. I felt like GOD at the time was nowhere to be seen.

As therapy continued, I learned along the way that my therapist, despite us living in a heavily Protestant area, was actually a Greek Orthodox. He hasn't told me much about it himself I don't think, but I grew interested. That's when I started learning, and learning more on my own through the internet, I expressed great interest and agreement with a lot of the Orthodox teachings. I began fasting, which was the first time I had ever fasted. All my life I wanted Christianity to feel more serious, I admired Orthodox beliefs, practices and culture. And I wanted to be closer to GOD. 

So around Christmas, my parents bought me an Orthodox Christian Bible, I consider this the day I officially joined the Orthodoxy. Unlike my other Bibles, I make an effort to read this one regularly, and pay close attention. I've practiced fasting, and Lent, and watched online streams of the closest Orthodox Church. ""So what's the problem?"" You may ask.

Well, I am greatly worried if i'm making Idols. If i'm making an Idol, then all my work to become closer to GOD has been nothing. Specifically, an Idol of my therapist. I know he isn't GOD or anything, he's just as much of a sinful roach as I am. I'm just, scared, and incredibly worried about making an Idol of him. So I ask, what are some signs of making Idols? This is a matter which bothers me greatly.",OrthodoxChristianity
It's just a structure....(thoughts and inquiry),Vwracer,1595596111,"Before I get burned at the stake and/or run out of the Orthodox world, just hear me out.

* 567 years ago, Constantinople fell. Hagia Sophia went into the Ottoman's hands and became a mosque.
* 85 years ago, the site was converted to a museum (from what I gather, it was a big compromise)
* Now it's a mosque again, albeit probably for a reelection bid.

Orthodoxy has had over half a century to have a plan B. It's been very obvious that Constantinople is gone, never to return (Unless someone founds a new one outside of Turkey).  

I understand the significance of the site, and it's history. What I cannot fathom is the ""this is the worst thing to happen since someone put pineapple on pizza"" school of thought. I know I'm not as well versed in scripture as some of you all are, but some things sticks in my mind.

* ""Church"" is not the building, but the people.
   * I've always been under the impression that it is the *People* that make up the church, the word *""ekklesia""* points to this as it is a group of people that make up a denomination, not the real estate.
* Paul met with the ""church"" that gathered in the house of Priscilla and Aquila in Rome.
* I noticed that when the Moscow-Constantinople schism happened, there were quite a few groups of people that broke off of the GOC and had to form ROC specific congregations (albeit that seems a bit silly because of internal bickering, but whatever).
   * Does the fact that these people who were without a building any less than those they came from?  Nah. It's just semantics at this point.

My cousin stole some perfume and eyeliner from me. What do you think I should do?,1depressedmess,1595576548,"My cousin (who is 14, I'm 25) has been staying with us while she visits the rest of her extended family for almost a month. They (herself, her parents, and 3 other siblings) initially came down together to visit for about 5 days then she asked her parents and my parents if she could stay longer. Of course we all agreed. She hadn't had any major behavioral problems (without going into too much detail, she had been through some traumatic experiences and had been lashing out at her immediate family for the past few years) in a while, so we all figured she deserved some extra time with her cousins if that's what she wanted. 

A couple of weeks ago, I noticed that I was missing a small bottle of perfume and an eyeliner pencil. I had thought that maybe I just misplaced them somewhere, but the more I thought about it the less likely it seemed. My cousin has a history of stealing from her family, and I became like 99% sure she took them. I didn't say anything to anyone but it stayed in the back of my mind. 

Fast forward to a couple days ago, a major bombshell happened. She had stolen my niece's old iPhone and took my parents' laptop. She somehow hacked into their laptop, did a factory reset and other technological things, all to talk to her boyfriend that she's supposed to not have not been talking to. It wasn't the first time she had talked to him while at our house either, as call logs would point out (she lied about using the laptop to talk to him, and lied about my niece ""giving"" her old iPhone to her). Basically she had never really changed. 

While she was in the shower, I decided to see for myself if she actually took my perfume and eyeliner. I went to her room and looked through her things. Sure enough, I found them in her suitcase. 

I know in the grand scheme of all the things she's done (especially recently,) that stolen perfume and eyeliner is quite small. 

So I just took them back and hid them. I never confronted her. I told my sister and said that I would probably let our mom know after our cousin left to go back home. Well this morning I ended up telling my mom because I just felt like it's something she needed to know, but I said to not tell or confront anyone, because I just feel like it's so insignificant when compared to everything else she's in trouble for (she's in hot water for more things she's done while down here, but this post is already long enough.)

But now I'm thinking a little differently. I know she's sick. She's been sick even before she went through the trauma that sort of catapulted her down the path she's on. I'm thinking about just putting the eyeliner and perfume back in her bag. I figure if she's so desperate for them and if that's her treasures that she wants to store on Earth then to just let her have them. 

I was never angry at her for stealing my things, just a little disappointed that she would think to steal from me. In the future if she ever wants to come clean to me and apologize, then of course I'll forgive her. I already forgive her. 

I just would like to know from a Christian standpoint what y'all think I should do? Would I be an enabler if I put the perfume and eyeliner back? I have never been in this situation before and hope I never have to be again.",OrthodoxChristianity

Update from a Ignorant Protestant,fbofh,1595466506,"Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/go95g6/an\_ignorant\_protestant\_asking\_for\_prayers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/go95g6/an_ignorant_protestant_asking_for_prayers/)

Well, a few days after my original post, my husband emailed the priest at the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral about visiting.  The priest called back and took a whole hour to talk to us on the phone, and he was more than happy to invite us to visit.  He's more enthusiastic about his faith than most Evangelicals I've ever met in 20 years!  Talk about a pleasant surprise.  The Sunday after my original post, we started going to the cathedral for the liturgy with two kids in tow.  Amazingly enough, the kids are quiet through the hour-long liturgy.  Fine, I pack them papers and color pencils, but at least they're quiet.

Our family has now officially left that Evangelical megachurch, and the cathedral is now referred to as ""our church"" in our family.  We told our friends at the Evangelical church that we  started going to a church ""closer to home."" While our friends at that church said they'll miss us, no one actually asked why we were leaving or exactly which church we were going to.  We'll explain if they ever ask, but for now, we'll just not offer any more explanation.

So 4 Sundays later, we're now participating in the liturgy every Sunday (except for the Communion part), and both my husband and I are stumbling through the Lord have mercy's and the Nicene Creed.  I feel so dumb not knowing something so fundamental as the Nicene Creed, but then again, for 20 years, no one has ever asked me to memorize this very personal statement of faith.  I'll get it eventually, which I guess, is the point.

On the reading front, I've finished the book ""Welcome to the Orthodox Church"" by Frederica Matthews-Green, and I now have a much better idea of what I'm getting into.  My husband is going through some podcasts on Ancient Faith Radio on church history and doctrine, and he's really into it.  The priest at the cathedral is going to give us a copy of the Orthodox Study Bible, and let's just say it's a lot thicker than the NIV Bible we have.  What have we been missing this last 20 years?  Probably a lot.  lol

So a big thank you to those who've prayed for us.  This is going to be a long road, but at least we now know which way we're heading.",OrthodoxChristianity

Authority of Rome and Antioch in Peter,gorillamutila,1595441935,"Hello

First and foremost, this is not an attempt to create polemics or be just another ""gotcha"" post.I want to understand the reasoning behind one aspect of the whole ""primus inter pares"" thing and what are the arguments for it.

Papal (or Roman) supremacy is usually defended due to Jesus' ""upon this rock I build my church"" speech and to the fact that Rome is traditionally believed to have been founded by St. Peter. If this indeed legitimates the claim for Roman supremacy that Roman Catholics advocate or, at best, is a simple statement of honorific precedence (which would be more in line with Orthodox understanding), why does the distinction fall upon Rome alone, and not Antioch, which is also traditionally believed to have been founded by St. Peter?

Orthodox view on church attendance? Is it sin to not go?,KingLothric1,1595421854,"Hi,  


Nowhere in scripture can I find that it is a sin - i.e. barriers will arise between you and our Father, making blessings/guidance less likely for you to receive - if you neglect going to liturgy once every week. I subscribe to the major protestant view on this matter - that our Father is pleased when I read my Bible every day, meditate upon his Word every day, pray every day, encourage other believers (I know there's a passage about this in Hebrews about not neglecting the gathering of believers, but where does it say it's a sin if its not done in a church specifically? I'm encouraging other believers when I talk to them in various forums such as these, visiting my believing family talking abut scripture etc.  


This is not to say that going to liturgy is completely useless. I like going there to receive sacraments (talking to the priest during confession, receiving Eucharist following this) at least 4 times a year, but why would it be a SIN not to go more regularly? I watch liturgies/sermons on Youtube on top of what I've described doing above.

It seems like some Orthodox share the Catholic view - it's a sin not to go for trivial reasons - while others are more liberal - you go when you want to go and it's not a sin, but it's encouraged. I subscribe to the latter.

Excerpt on The Church from ORTHODOX DOGMATIC THEOLOGY: CONCISE EXPOSITION By PROTOPRESBYTER MICHAEL POMAZANSKY,georglukacs,1595295858,"The Church of Christ

  THE CONCEPT OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST ON EARTH

  IN the literal meaning of the word, the Church is the “assembly,” in Greek, ekklesia, from ekkaleo, meaning “to gather.” In this meaning it was used in the Old Testament also (the Hebrew kahal).

  In the New Testament, this name has an incomparably deeper and more mystical meaning which is difficult to embrace in a short verbal formula. The character of the Church of Christ is best explained by the Biblical images to which the Church is likened.

  The New Testament Church is the new planting of God, the garden of God, the vineyard of God. The Lord Jesus Christ, by His earthly life, His death on the Cross and His Resurrection, introduced into humanity new Grace-giving powers, a new life which is capable of great fruitfulness. These powers we have in the Holy Church which is His Body.

  The Sacred Scripture is rich in expressive images of the Church. Here are the chief of them:

  a) The image of the grapevine and its branches (John 15:1–8). I am the true vine, and My Father is the Husbandman. Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.... Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in Me. I am the Vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.... Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples.

  b) The image of the shepherd and the flock (John 10:1–16). Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.... Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.... I am the door; by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and find pasture.... I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.... I am the good shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of mine ... and I lay down My life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.

  c) The image of the head and the body (Eph. 1:22–23, and other places). The Father hath put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is His Body, the fullness of Him that filleth all in all.

  d) The image of a building under construction (Eph. 2:19–22). Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone; in Whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord; in Whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit.

  e) The image of a house or family: That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the Truth (I Tim. 3:15). Christ as a Son over His own house, Whose house are we (Heb. 3:6).

  To this same thing refer likewise other images from the Gospel: the fishing net, the field which has been sown, the vineyard of God.

  In the Fathers of the Church one often finds a comparison of the Church in the world with a ship on the sea.

  The Apostle Paul, comparing the life of the Church of Christ with a marriage, or with the relationship between man and wife, concludes his thoughts with these words: This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church (Eph. 5:32). The life of the Church in its essence is mystical; the course of its life cannot be entirely included in any “history.” The Church is completely distinct from any kind whatever of organized society on earth.

  The Beginning of the Church’s Existence, Its Growth, and Its Purpose

  The Church of Christ received its existence with the coming to earth of the Son of God, when the fullness of the time was come (Gal. 4:4), and with His bringing of salvation to the world.

  The beginning of its existence in its complete form and significance, with the fullness of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, was the day of Pentecost, after the Ascension of the Lord. On this day, after the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, in Jerusalem there were baptized about three thousand men. And, further, the Lord each day added those being saved to the Church. From this moment, the territory of the city of Jerusalem, then of Palestine, then of the whole Roman Empire, and even the lands beyond its boundaries, began to be covered with Christian communities or churches. The name “church” which belongs to every Christian community, even of a single house or family, indicates the unity of this part with the whole, with the body of the whole Church of Christ.

  Being “the body of Christ,” the Church increaseth with the increase of God (Col. 2:19). Comparing the Church with a building, the Apostle teaches that its building is not completed, but continues: All the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord (Eph. 2:21). This growth is not only in the sense of the visible, quantitative increase of the Church on earth; in even greater degree, this is a spiritual growth, the perfection of the saints, the filling up of the heavenly-earthly world through sanctity. Through the Church is accomplished the dispensation of the fullness of times foreordained by the Father, so that He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth (Eph. 1:10).

  In the sense of its earthly growth, the Church develops in the spheres of Divine services and the canons; it is made richer by Patristic literature; it grows in the outward forms which are necessary for its earthly conditions of existence.

  The Church is our spiritual Home. As with one’s own home — and even more than that — a Christian’s thoughts and actions are closely bound up with the Church. In it he must, as long as he lives on earth, work out his salvation, and make use of the Grace-given means of sanctification given him by it. It prepares its children for the heavenly homeland.

  As to how, by the Grace of God, spiritual rebirth and spiritual growth occur in a man, in what sequence these usually occur, what hindrances must be overcome by him on the way of salvation, how he must combine his own indispensable labors with the Grace-given help of God — special branches of theological and spiritual learning are devoted to all these matters. These are called moral theology and ascetic theology.

 Dogmatic Theology proper limits the subject of the Church to an examination of the Grace-given conditions and the mystical, Grace-given means furnished in the Church for the attainment of the aim of salvation in Christ.

Converting to Orthodoxy from Catholicism,lifethruchrist,1595288747,"Hi r/OrthodoxChristianity! I've been a long time reader, first time posting.   
I was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church as a baby, but was never heavily religious growing up.

Just a few questions about converting. Anyone here convert from Roman Catholic to Eastern Orthodox? does the EO church accept Catholic baptism? Would I be rebaptised?

Why are the Epistle and Gospel chanted from different places?,hipsterbeard12,1595253934,"It is my understanding that in synagogues all reading was done from the bimah.  The Church continued this tradition and there was a central bimah for readings.  Later it seems like the bimah got truncated to just the small outcropping in the solea.  This has resulted in an oddity where the bimah is gone from it's original location, but the epistle is still read from it's former location in the center of the church; whereas the gospel is read from the raised structure at the solea instead of from the center of the church.

Does anyone have any insights as to why this is?  What happened?  Why are they not read from the same place?

My speculation is that originally the bimah was just moved to the front, but as it got shorter it became associated with being part of the tabernacle/altar/royal doors group and so inappropriate for lesser clerics to stand there for reading the epistle.",OrthodoxChristianity

"Is There Any Evidence That ""Luke Painted Icons?""",BrotherAugustine,1595233789,"The Church often tells us that ""Luke painted icons"" as a defense of iconography. However, I've read through a fair amount of patristic literature, and have been unable to find a single reference to this idea before the 8th century (when St. John of Damascus mentioned it in his defense of iconography regarding the iconoclasts). It wasn't mentioned by Luke, any of the other Apostles, or any of their students (or their students, or their students). I find it very hard to believe that everyone knew about this and yet not one single person mentioned it for 700 years after the event supposedly took place, but I'm open to believing this story if there's a shred of evidence for its truth. Saying ""because it's tradition!"" is not evidence, and neither is accusing me of heresy for asking this question. I shouldn't have to mention that but I've tried bringing this up enough to know the usual two responses. 

So the question remains: is there a shred of evidence for this story, or a single mention of it anytime before the 8th century? I want it to be true, since the yarn that unwinds if it isn't is a very serious one regarding the Church's claims to truth.

I have always avoided religion, but was able to see beauty in it. For example, I love how Muslims pray. 

My fiancé prays similarly, even though he is GOC. At night, he will kneel by himself in his office and pray. He will not bow or anything like Muslims do, but the kneeling is the same. 

When I asked him why he prays that way (I had never seen christians or catholics do this) he just told me that was the way his parents and church taught him.

I've used the ""Orthodox"" prefix in the title because, without wanting to disdain anyone, I'm certainly not interested in any ""reformed"" or ""modern"" branch. I've heard from such channels that there seems to be some disagreements between some branches and compromises mainly for political reasons, therefore I'm asking for something that would be considered more....

"Dreams with icons, is there a meaning behind?",wweeww2121,1595107574,"I had a dream with the icon of Virgin Mary, where I was using a game characters ability to shoot it or something, as if it had a health bar I was seeing (im not trolling). That was odd. Games have been a downfall for me as they made me lazy, maybe telling me to stop playing games or something?

Now I’ve posted about wether I committed the unforgivable sin on this subreddit ( you guys have been incredibly helpful), and I had a period where I was going through some hard stuff. Basically I was dreaming about waking up in my bed. The whole house looked very similar to it. I’ve been getting threats from people telling me to get my parents to move out of the house or some bad stuff was going to happen. A long long dream. So I went to the room in my house where the icon with Jesus was, and I think I was praying to it, but the icon looked strange. It wasn’t, like, 2D. The icon I have Jesus would be looking at you.

However, this icon was looking to the left, and when I was praying the facial expression changed. I think at some point it looked as if Jesus was laughing at me or something. When I woke up from the dream, I was still unsure weather I even worked up or was still in the dream. So I looked back at the icon with Jesus and saw that it looked normal, so I understood it was not a dream. Can God affect my dreams? Can the enemy affect my dreams? My dad tells me not to give much significance at all to them. What do you guys think? Edit: The icon of Jesus, Im not sure, but i think he was also praying.",OrthodoxChristianity

They no longer can act as husband and wife in the bed because sex must be unitive and open to procreation, and anything other than vaginal is intrinsically immoral (even though you can have sex while the wife is pregnant). This just seemed wrong to me. My questions are these:

Does Orthodoxy teach the same in this situation? I know the usual response is that we should talk to our priest because it's intimate and private, but I gotta know at least what most priests would counsel.

If Christ did exist, why would he leave the Church without definite leadership (papal powers)?

I have seen the light that is Orthodox Christianity,WakingZac,1594953217,"I grew up going to Catholic Church with parents who didn’t actually believe, but thought it was something we should do because their parents did etc. I was never atheist, to me it seemed that took more faith than believing in a higher power but I would have considered myself agnostic. A few years ago I decided to pick that Bible up off my shelf and give it a read for the first time as an adult and immediately felt its truth, and saw the error in my ways clearly illustrated. After a quite a bit of reading and studying, I figured I should probably find a church, but what one?? I searched far and wide, and could probably tell you the fundemental beliefs of just about every denomination. I was honestly close to giving the Jehovah’s Witnesses a call because I thought for the most part they had a lot of the scripture accurately understood, but the cult like mentality and thinking Jesus was Michael, failed predictions etc kept me away luckily. So I ended up going to a conservative Baptist church that a few of my friends went to, and overall I liked the pastor and the people, but coming from a Catholic background, it didn’t feel like “church” to me as much as it did like a Bible study. Another issue I started running into was the with sola scriptura one could almost interpret the Bible in any way they rationalized it in their mind. I found it amusing that these Baptists would scoff at Jehovah’s Witnesses for not believing in the Trinity while at the same time saying that infant baptism was heretical and leading people to hell. Trying to explain that the trinitarian doctrine was not uniform in the very early church and that the council of Nicea in 325AD established this while the people who thought infant baptism wasn’t correct were deemed heretical in 180AD most likely, was met with indifference and basically “oh well who really cares what the early church did” and I started to realize they were being heretical of the early saints and martyrs and didn’t care because they only know church history after 1500. The more I learned about the early church the more I realized the problems with sola scriptura because the early church predates the Bible. Anyway I had a conversation about this with the pastor a few days ago and he basically said he didn’t know anything about early church history and could not answer any of my questions. At that point I knew I could no longer go to or be apart of the heresies of the Protestant tradition. I knew far to much about the Catholics and the Popes heresies to consider that so I looked into Orthodoxy and was blown away with the truth they spoke, and their ties to the early church. I have come to the conclusion that this is the church that Christ said the gates of hell will not prevail against. So I looked online to find the nearest Orthodox Church to me, and unfortunately I live out in the country so it will be a bit of a drive, but no distance is too far for finding Jesus’ true church. There is a Greek church about 1 hr away but unfortunately they are a very liberal/modern church it appears for their website and the YouTube videos I could find of their liturgies. There is a ROCOR church about 2.5hrs away that is very traditional and still doing everything by the book so I will most likely be attending their this Sunday. There is also a Romanian Orthodox that seems fairly traditional about 2.25 hrs away so I may talk to them as well. Anyway I’ve been bingeing Orthodox YouTube videos for the past couple of days but other than that is there anything I should do in preparation? What do you guys think of the ROCOR church?

"I was raised Catholic, but I'm not sure if I believe in the Papacy anymore. Please let me know if my reasoning makes sense, and if you think my beliefs align with Orthodoxy more.",Mysterylover90s,1594933964,"So basically the Catholics use Matthew 16:18-19 to justify the Papacy. Peter is the first one to say that Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God, and then Jesus says to Peter, ""You will now be called Peter (which means rock), and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind and loose here will be binded and loosed in Heaven."" 

The Catholics believe that when Jesus said Peter was the rock and got the keys, they interpret it as the Church would start with Peter, that Peter is the ""chief"" apostle, and that Peter would pass the keys on to someone else to be the next supreme disciple. I agree with the Catholics that Peter did start the Church with his confession of faith and I agree with them that Peter was the leader of the apostles. But, the Catholics interpret ""the keys"" as being individual keys, and that only one disciple can get the keys after Peter to be the supreme disciple who is more powerful than the other disciples, and they believe that that disciple is whoever is the Bishop of Rome. They also seem to think that the word ""rock"" means that Peter is supreme. 

But, when the word ""rock"" was translated, it actually means that it is a small stone that is a much bigger part of larger stone structure. So, I believe that when Jesus said Peter was the ""rock"" after Peter said Jesus was the Messiah, Peter was the first stone that was placed in the structure of the Church. In Matthew 18, Jesus gives all of the other apostles the ""binding"" and ""loosing"" power that he gave Peter. Since Peter was the first one that said that Jesus was the Messiah, it makes sense that Peter would be the first rock, but all of the other apostles are stones in there own sense, that were also metaphorically placed after Peter in the process of creating the Church. The fact that Jesus gave the other apostles ""binding"" and ""loosing"" powers shows that he did not think that Peter was superior to them and supreme over them. 

Also, there are not one pair of keys for one person. In Luke 11:52, it is highlighted that keys are meant to represent knowledge. So, since Peter was the first one to say Jesus was the Messiah, it makes sense that Jesus would say Peter had gotten the keys because he has gotten the keys of knowledge that Jesus is the Son of God. The other apostles would acquire the keys when they had truly understood who Jesus was. 

Truth is, the Scriptures do not lay out a clear path of what is the one true Church. I can tell Christ wants us to find it with a lot of research and prayer. I feel as though I am going back and forth and back and forth to try to find the Truth. Since nothing is clearly laid out, I think it is problematic to take a legalistic approach to religion, which the Catholic Church does. A lot of this is a mystery to be honest, and I agree with the Orthodox, we need to focus on what God is not, rather than try to prove who he exactly is.",OrthodoxChristianity
What's Your Score on this Old World vs New World Philosophy Test?,MatrixMan43,1594933127,"# The following is taken from the [Why Are We Talking About Rabbits? podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1150730) by John Heers for the [First Things Foundation](https://first-things.org/).

1.5. [Why Are We Talking About Rabbits?](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1150730) Light People Test

And now for the coolest way to get into the **mind** of the Old World folks, and into your own mind, I’ve devised a little rating system that is going to reveal the deepest mysteries of your mind to you…. A thought meter that evaluates just how New World or Old World you are. And why are we doing this again? We are using this “very” scientific investigation to get a gauge on who we are as we listen to this podcast about who we are… and where we all might be heading. So, want to take the WAWTAR *lightpeople* test? Want to see just how Old World you really are?

Okay, here we go. Get a pen. If not, be old school and just remember your answers… then add. And, well, you’ll learn something about yourself. There are five questions. Each question gets a score between 0-3.

§  **3 is,** oh hell yes, that is 100% how I feel.

§  **2 is** something like, “Well, it sounds good but I’m not solid on that…”

§  **1** **is** I don’t really feel that good about it but could be true.

§  **0 is**, oh hell no, that does not feel very good or true.

Ready. Let’s take the test. How do you rate on the *light* *people* WAWTAR index? Here are the 5 questions I came up with:

1. When I die I won’t really die all the way, it’s more like I’m asleep waiting for a next world of some sort
2. The best way to get to know me is to ask someone else about me.  
3. When I carry a picture of my friend / parent / etc. in my purse or wallet I am actually carrying that person around with me. Like, they are there, actually close to me. 
4. Respect isn’t earned, it is owed by you to others 
5. I can’t wait to live with my parents in one big house when they get really old! 

1.6. Results

Now, let’s do calculations: Add up your scores. Great. Now that you have your number, let’s go through this together and figure out where you stand on our New World versus Old World continuum. Just how *light* of a *light* person are you?

If you scored a:

15: THE CHARLEMAGNE: You come in as “Full Retro”. You think Old World style big time. You drink from a goblet. There’s a good chance that you own a pre-Columbian handmade weapon of some sort. The en*light*ened philosophers were trying to rid the earth of you. Like, you’d feel comfortable chillin’ out with Bedouins.

12-14 THE VILLAGER: The Old World way is in your bones. There’s a really good chance you hate malls. Places like Algeria and Ethiopia roll out the red carpet for you. Your Spotify collection includes chants from some hard to pronounce province, and you love that you can’t understand them. And you wish for more and more hierarchy!

7-11 : THE SUBURBAN: You feel romantic about the Old World, but hierarchy is a word that you’d rather read about in a book. It feels like you should want to obey your elders a lot more than you actually do. The individual is not more important than the group, except well, sometimes you feel more important than lots of dumb groups. So there’s that. 

4-6: THE SHINING CITY DWELLER ON THE HILL: You have hope for the modern world because you trust science and Reddit. If people would do what scientists told them to do, then society would be a lot better off. So would scientists. You think Columbus was a jerk, but also you weirdly really appreciate the New World philosophies that he helped download into your very Columbian brain. 

1-3: The HIGH NOONER: The bright *light* of New World hovers at high noon for you, just right there, shining down like a perma-halo from a perfectly engineered drone that follows your every move. You love manuals. You trust your brain more than you trust your uncle, and you don’t get why people can’t just be better. Education is the key… like, to everything. 

0: THE FRANCIS BACON AWARD: Old World thinking has the same appeal to you as placing leaches on an open sore. You are so *light* that you enjoy concocting new ways to study the effects that scientific studies have on science students. You developed a personal organizer to help you choose which personal organizer to use when deciding what Netflix show to start next.

"Results, Discussion, Feedback, and Questions on the Survey on Various Perspectives of Hell in Christianity",pjsans,1594912182,"*\[Preface: This is being posted on all subs that the initial survey was on. Not all questions, feedback responses, discussion points, etc. will be relevant and applicable to all subs. If you simply want the results of the survey look no further than the first section.\]*

Hello all! A week ago I posted a survey to this sub going over the various Christians perspectives of hell. I got *way* more responses than I was expecting and some incredibly helpful feedback. Thank you all so much! I wanted to address some of that feedback as well as allow a place for discussion on the survey/the survey's topic. This is going to be a *long* post discussing the survey, the responses, and plans for future surveys so if you just want the results, you can find them [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAxBUu0OWq_ysl1xEtSezWbR6Hc-zxsAKfkjmcpSS0ZBebfw/closedform) (just click 'see previous responses'),  and the spreadsheet form [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19zS716Hi-W17TY7Fgr0GzoFZ4tYNAlseYzuw_zeQIM0/edit?usp=sharing). Just a head's up: because the survey was so long it will take a moment to load the results.

**FEEDBACK THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT TIME**

As I mentioned, I got a lot of great responses and ideas of how to make things work next time around, so I'd like to go through some things I plan to change in future surveys:

1. ***Better Representation of Non-Protestant Perspectives*** It was rightly pointed out that the survey questions and responses were tailored more to Protestantism. In the future, I will do better at making sure questions and response options better reflect Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodoxy (especially the latter because I definitely did a poor job with that one).
2. ***Better Neutrality in Non-Hell Areas*** Many survey-takers were able to pick up on my own religious biases in Protestantism, Reformed thought, and Penal Substitutionary Atonement. I'll definitely try to do better with this as many found accurately answering the questions were difficult because it did not fit in their framework.
3. ***Defining Terms*** Why I didn't do much of this, I really don't know. This seemed to be a big (and understandable) stumbling block for a lot of people and I know quite a few ended the survey early on because I didn't provide adequate definitions. In the future I will be sure to define the terms that I use so everyone is on the same page and so people who haven't done much looking into this topic have a better understanding of what I'm asking.
4. ***Better Terminology*** Many found the language that I used problematic. For traditional view of Hell, I went with *Eternal Conscious Punishment.* This was kind of a stumbling block for some people. The three most common names for this view is *Eternal Conscious Punishment,* *Eternal Conscious Torment,* or *Traditionalism.* In my mind ECP was the least problematic for the purposes of the survey, but many did not feel this was the case. This came especially from a) Eastern Orthodox folks and b) from people who did not believe 'punishment' was an accurate way to describe what will happen to the unsaved. I'm open to suggestions on what label to use here to denote a) existence forever and b) negative experience in that existence.
5. ***Length*** Most felt the survey was too long, I will slim it down in the future.
6. ***Quotes*** Many felt that I should not have included the names of the people who said the quotes in the Quote section. I definitely see what they're saying and would likely take them out in the future. However, I will probably remove this section altogether in the future as many found it unnecessary and I think I agree. At the same time, some of the responses seemed to indicate that the quote section was one of the more illuminating parts of the survey...so, again, open to thoughts on this.
7. ***More Options*** Many people pointed out that I did not leave enough options for people to nuance their answer or to simply say that they did not know. Along with this, there were many who were on the fence who didn't know which section to fill out, so I'm considering adding a section for people who are undecided between views.
8. ***Conditional Questions*** The way that this survey was supposed to work is that there should have been 2 sections that were left blank by everyone. For example, If you held to Annihilationism, you would have left the Eternal Conscious Punishment and Universalism sections blank. I wrote this in the section headings, but I understand most people skip past those. As a result many were confused and thought the survey was biased towards ECP (despite the fact that I'm an Annihilationist), since that was the first section and stopped after that (which does play a factor in the data). Others filled out sections for multiple views (which again, factors into the data). It wasn't until getting feedback that I realized I could make certain questions/sections conditional, as in, if you answer that you're an Annihilationist, you won't be able to answer the questions meant for Universalists. So I will be sure to implement that next time to help with confusion.
9. ***Humility*** A few people pointed out that we should be hesitant in our dogmatism for some of the questions asked because for many of the things in the survey, Scripture is not super detailed on. I totally agree. This survey was meant to be more of a 'what are your thoughts' than 'what would you dogmatically say,' but I want to make that more clear next time around.
10. ***1-10 Scale Instead of 1-5 Scale***
11. ***Transparency*** When I posted the survey, I did not give much information so I got a lot of questions about why I was posting, how it would be used, would others get the results, more info about me, etc. I'll be sure to include that in the future but in the mean time I would like to answer those questions here for any that are curious. You can find this below in the *purposes* section.
12. ***Editor*** In the future, I plan to get a few people to go through the survey at its final point to check for grammar/consistency *and* to make sure that people holding perspectives I don't feel more fairly represented (so Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Progressive, Universalists, etc.) *\[If you felt your perspective was under represented and would like to proof-read drafts for the next time around, let me know and I might hit you up when the time comes. I'll probably only select 1 or 2 people from each perspective though.\]*

A couple of things that were brought up that I'm unsure about were:

1. ***Scripture Questions*** Initially I had a section specifically devoted to answering questions about Scripture verses used in the hell discussion. I simply couldn't think of a way to do it that a) wasn't cumbersome and b) didn't assume too much study prior to the survey. Along with that, some who looked at rough drafts didn't think including them would be helpful. I'm open to suggestions here.
2. ***Evaluation of Greek and Hebrew Words/ Biblical Phrases*** When discussing the afterlife, the following Greek and Hebrew/ Biblical Phrases terms show up: Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, Lake of Fire, and Tartarus. Sometimes people (and Bible translations) refer to all of these as 'Hell' while others make a distinction between some of them. Initially I did have questions about these but decided to remove them because I did not think many would really have been aware of the specific terms. However, I did get a couple responses asking about their inclusion. So I'm debating whether or not to ask questions about the specific Biblical terms used in the discussion.

\------------------------------------------------------------------

**PURPOSES**

This section is in reference to the *Transparency* item above. Here I will discuss the purpose of this survey, how it will be used, and a little background information about myself since several people have asked me.

These questions were *purely* for my own curiosity and will not be used in any academic way. I recently spent a lot of time studying the topic out and realized that I had never really heard the 'other sides' of the discussion. After a lot of study and wrestling, I came out holding another position. This is by no means meant to be a survey to try and 'evangelize' or 'convert' people to my position, but I was curious where people were at and how much they've thought about it. I do think its something that people should think more about, if for no other reason than to know firmly why you believe what you believe and to be able to accurately represent other people, even if you disagree with them. While it was not the main goal of the study, I was happy to see many people saying that they felt they had to do more studying on the subject and I do hope that the survey serves to be a point of discussion.

Some of the questions may confuse people in this context. For example, I asked questions about Limited/Universal Atonement or if people were KJV-onlyists. While not immediately connected to the doctrine of hell, within the broader debate/discussion things like that do come in certain ways, so I was interested to see answers to that as well.

I know that this survey was a little rocky. This was my first time making one like this, so I appreciate all of the patience and grace that I got in the feedback and for people's willingness to try to take it in spite of its flaws.

\------------------------------------------------------------------

**FURTHER FEEDBACK QUESTIONS**

With all that out of the way, thank you all again *so much* for taking this survey. Please feel free to discuss the results or provide further feedback. I would love if some could give feed back to the questions below:

1. How often should I post this survey (once a year? every 2 years? never again in the whole existence of all that exists within existent existence?)
2. For Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics, what questions or answer options can I include to better make you feel represented?
3. What label should I use instead of *Eternal Conscious Punishment* to convey an eternal existence that is experienced negatively?
4. What are some subreddits I should include next time around?
5. For those of you who did not like the terms 'evil' or 'punishment,' what terms should I use instead?
6. What terms should I use when asking questions about demons, evil spirits, the devil, etc.?
7. Are there any specific questions you wish I had asked?

\------------------------------------------------------------------

Question about my baptism,meagenf,1594888624,"So I was raised in a different faith but converted to Orthodoxy several years ago. At the time, I was certain I’d need baptized, as the faith I was raised in doesn’t baptize you until you’re a child, and I had zero recollection of that happening. 

However, when I mentioned this to my mother, she insisted I’d already been baptized and I must just not remember (it would’ve been around age 5-6). I reached out to my former preacher and asked him that if he’d baptized me, could he provide any record? He ended up sending me a letter saying he had baptized me as a child. (The church is now closed so not sure if he couldn’t provide an actual record because of this.)

This was enough for my priest at the time, and we proceeded with the chrismation and I have been happily a member of the church for several years. 

However, it stills weighs on my heart when I think about it. What if they were wrong and I wasn’t baptized? Is my soul at risk for not questioning them harder and going along, after being told that I was baptized?",OrthodoxChristianity

I came back because I’ve read some passages about how you’d be put to death, cursed and stuff like that. Would I even be considered human in the eyes of God?

Is it considered a bad bad sexual sin or does it go beyond that? I want to go to confession, but again, I don’t really have somewhere to go and I would only be able to go in quite a lot of time.

Is there a version of the bible that incorporates analysis?,Koyaanisqatsi2Jesus,1594850300,"So I'm finding that I seem to just be the wrong level of IQ for the bible - too high to be interested in just the surface-level of what is going on, but not nearly enough to understand deeper meanings or even decode non-obvious events (to be fair to myself, I'd posit you'd need to be at least 2 standard deviations above normal and have a background in ancient societies and languages to have a chance.)

So I keep coming across things that just seem very weird every few pages, researching them, and then finding out that yes, in fact what these things mean is, in fact, completely non-obvious to a reader of a translation without knowledge of the ancient world.

Two of the most memorable examples: 

The bit in Genesis where Noah's sons ""see his nakedness"". My reaction was ""wait, that's weird, same-gender people must have seen each other naked all the time then. Did his sons f-ing rape him or something? But that doesn't make sense either, because why does god curse the rapist's son instead of the rapists themselves?"" And then research shows that, indeed, to ""see the nudity"" of another does, in fact, mean sex in the bible, but only with heterosexual sex, but also at that time the rape of a wife was considered primarily an offense against the husband, so what clearly happened is that the son raped the wife, and the person cursed was the incestuous outcome of that rape.

I want a version of the bible that just says that happened, without euphemisms whose clarity has completely disappeared over the last two thousand years. It just seems like a pathetic failure of translation to me, to neither translate nor even footnote idioms incredibly specific to society thousands of years ago. I can recall no other area where such slipshod and lazy translation has been thought acceptable. Why do people seem to care more about understanding the minutia of Shakesphere than simple things that happen in The Bible?

Another example is the bit with Jesus expelling the demons into the pigs. What does God have against swine? Didn't he make them? This lead me to René Girard's analysis that this is actually perhaps second only to Christ's resurrection as an event in the bible, as it reverses the baseline story of all myth and religion up to that point w.r.t. scapegoating. 

Now, both of these digressions were super-interesting, but I have ADHD, and at this rate I'll finish the bible in maybe 20 years if I stick with it. I really want to have a somewhat holistic picture of what happens in my head pretty quickly. I've found ""The Bible Project,"" but although in theory, it's close to what I'm talking about, it seems to be written by people with a knack of making intrinsically interesting things dead-boring.

So I'm wondering if there is anything like a completely analytical paraphrasing of the bible, or a cliff notes version that manages to be interesting. Of course a paraphrasing from an Orthodox POV would be preferable, but really from anyone actually *opinionated* and interested in logical consistency would be fine.

Just to give some examples, here are a few biblical analysis I've found super-enthralling:

https://youtu.be/h84rRWfY4A8

All of Jordan Peterson's Bible talks

An ironic thing is how much more successful secular people have been with making morality plays in the bible interesting. One of the reasons I became interested in Christianity was that people pointed out that a supermajority of my favorite plays, films, and books were in fact explicitly based on bible stories. But oddly the billions of religious people over millennia don't seem to have the literary skills of a handful of atheist sci-fi writers in half a century. It just seems bizarre to me that this isn't a thriving avenue of endeavor for what, for many, is clearly supposed to be an evangelistic religion. I have come across stuff like ""The Jesus Movie,"" which seem to me so low in writing and acting quality as to be anti-evangelical tools. (Props to the set and costume people however, I had to turn off the audio after twenty minutes to avoid fatal cringe, but the visuals seemed very professional.)",OrthodoxChristianity

Gender Imbalance in the Orthodox Church,fear-no-grave,1594842911,"I haven't been able to attend my local parish due to ""you know what"" (not trying to trigger the bot), so I've been continuing to make due with online services. I've actually really enjoyed this because it has afforded me the opportunity to view services outside of the U.S. as well.

However, it led me to notice a trend, which seems to occur internationally. There seems to be way more women in attendance at services than men. Like 5-10 women per man. This isn't something I'd typically notice or even look for, but because it seems to be so prevalent, I started to notice it more.

Is this a common occurrence? I know Christianity as a whole has more female attendees than male, but I haven't noticed it to this extent. Is this common at your parish? I'm honestly just curious, not trying to make this thread into a gender studies commentary.

A Reflection on the Hagia Sophia and Our Christian Response,SSPXarecatholic,1594832593,"Over the past week or so, the news of what has occurred in Istanbul, and the decision to return the Hagia Sophia to the status of a Mosque has upset many Christians, in particular those of our Eastern Orthodox faith. It is understandable, that we are frustrated with this decision. I will be the first to admit, that as soon as I heard the terrible news, I was immediately infuriated at such a bold and clearly political move from Erdogan to solidify his hardline Muslim base.

 However, as time has worn on, and I have seen more and more posts about this, I am more disappointed with the response of my fellow Orthodox Christians and the complete and utter vitriol and pettiness that has characterized their response, and the vengeful actions many are calling for. The number of calls for war to ensue between a joint Orthodox coalition of Russians and Greeks against Turkey is startling and makes me wonder whether we have forgotten the weightier matters of the law in preference to a prophecy of an Athonite monk. We honestly think that “reclaiming” Anatolia and the Hagia Sophia is more important than the lives of thousands who would die for a religious war over a Basilica which has not serviced a Christian community in over 500 years. This, if anything, has *ruined* our witness to the world. We are called not to return evil for evil, but *good for evil*. That if anyone takes our cloak, we are to also give them our shirt. We have forgotten that to be a Christian it is better, *always better,* to be persecuted than to persecute, to be killed rather than to kill. We have forgotten the weightier matters of the law which *command us* to love our enemies, to love all Men, not just those whom we love. We have chosen rather to conform ourselves to the patterns of this world, which is to return evil for evil, over a city and a building which have never been central to our faith in Jesus Christ.

Today’s feast is that of the Holy Prince Vladimir Equal to the Apostles, who upon converting to the True Faith, left behind his former self, from that of a fierce warrior who killed his brothers, to one concerned for the poor and needy. May St. Vladimir pray for us, that we might be converted in heart to care less for the powers and machinations of this world, but rather, to store up for ourselves treasures in the Kingdom to come, which is our true home, where neither moth nor rust consume, nor thieves break in and steal. I urge all of us to remember that we are not of this world, and that we belong to the next. So, Erdogan can have the Hagia Sophia for all I care, because it is not central to my faith.

Philosophical Question: Why is God a Trinity?,TheFiveStarMan,1594770882,"A few things right off the bat: 1) I fully affirm the doctrine of the Trinity, and 2) I understand that many/most Orthodox folks are probably content to just leave it at ""it's a mystery.""  I'm just interested in philosophical questions like this.

While I think it's possible that God just IS that way, I'm also inclined to think that he's that way by necessity, and I think this passage from 1 John 4 might be the key to understanding why:

&gt;Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for **God is love**.

If God's very nature is love, then it seems reasonable to me that this necessities one or more relationships existing within the Godhead (between the Persons of the Trinity).

But why three? Why not two? Why not four?

As best I can tell, it's because the KIND of love that God is is communal in nature. That is, it's the kind of love that doesn't just move in one direction, but in multiple. And that would explain why God chose to create human beings in his image, as this is a God who is eternally looking to share his ""communal love nature"" with others. And three Persons within the Godhead is the quintessential expression of that.

That seems to be the type of love John is talking about here.  Could be wrong though. Any thoughts or ideas?",OrthodoxChristianity

I think it's time to talk to a priest. GOC or ROCOR?,CalvinSpurge,1594743321,"\*EDIT: I don't know how to edit the title.  I used the wrong acronym.  I meant GOARCH not GOC

I think it's time to talk to a priest to talk about converting.  There is no Orthodox church nearby.  There is a Greek Orthodox Church 45 minutes away and a Russian Orthodox Church that is about an 70 minutes away.  I don't even know what questions to ask to help me make this decision.

The current plan is  to make arrangements to meet with both priests and go from there. My question for you, my dear friends, is which do you think I should choose and why?  This could be a super serious answer or it could be silly.  I'm trying to get whatever input I can.  One thing that would be greatly appreciated would be something in audio format.  I spend 9 hours a day trapped in a cubicle so something to listen to and take notes while I work is helpful.  Thanks in advance.

There's a bit of background and long-winded stream of consciousness below. It's not essential for the question.

&amp;#x200B;

This is something that I've been seriously contemplating since January of 2017.  I still don't know if I'm ready but I cannot be indecisive anymore.  This is a scary time for me because if I go through with this I'm likely to lose most of my friends and most of my social net.  Most of them will view me as a heretic and we'll be alone for a while.  Hopefully there are some Orthodox Christians in my town that also have to make the long journey to church that I might be able to briefly lean on.  I take comfort in the words of Our Lord throughout scripture, such as in Matthew 16

&gt;24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me will find it. 26 For what will a person be benefited if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what will a person give in exchange for his life? 27 For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and at that time he will reward each one according to what he has done. 28 Truly I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”

I am concerned about the distance to get to church. Right now, in my Reformed Baptist Church I'm a deacon.  My church is less than 10 minutes from my house.  Before the pandemic I was either there or meeting somewhere else with church members 5 days a week and twice on Sundays.    When I convert, I don't know if I could afford that much involvement because of that distance.  I don't want my priest to think that I'm not sincere enough or that I'm not taking this seriously.  If I'm only there on Sundays it will be difficult to really get ""plugged in"" with the congregation.  I'm afraid that we'll just be another face in the crowd.  It's also disheartening that I will end up missing so much going on with the church.  I don't know exactly how to communicate that thought, however.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for the long winding post.  This is some of the stuff I was trying to post before but it didn't seem appropriate for this subreddit.  I didn't want to be the new guy spamming the board with every thought going through his head...yet here we are.

Can you miss a service in the Orthodox church?,constance1882,1594686677,"Hello, hope you all are well.

I am a Protestant who has been interested in converting to a richer faith tradition, namely either Orthodox Christianity or Roman Catholicism. I am continuing to explore both, and would appreciate any prayers for this journey.

I have a question for you however -

Based on what I have heard Catholics say, it is considered a 'grave sin' to miss mass on Sundays unless you have a *very* good reason for why you were unable to attend.

While I understand this belief, it seems a little strict in the sense that it does not take 'real life' into account. Perhaps your child is having a level 10 meltdown and you just cannot get out of the house, or a long-distance friend comes to town whom you haven't seen in years but they can only get together Sunday morning, etc.

So my question is, are you able to miss a service in the Orthodox church or is this also viewed as a major sin?

"I was raised Catholic, but after doing a lot of research, I think I agree with Orthodoxy's view of the Filioque. Please let me know if my reasoning makes sense.",Mysterylover90s,1594673049,"So, I was raised Catholic, but I never took the time to truly find out if my church was the one true Church or not. Quarantine has given me some time to do some research. 

So I was reading a blog post written by a Catholic dedicated to explaining why the Filioque is true, but there are a lot of flaws in his argument. The Catholics use Revelation 22:1 as evidence to say why the Filioque is true. On Bible gateway, Revelation 22:1 is written as: ""Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb"" ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A1&amp;version=NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A1&amp;version=NIV)). But, on this guy's blog, he said the verse was this: ""And he showed me a **river of water of life**, clear as crystal,  
***proceeding*** *from the throne of God* ***and*** *of the Lamb*."" ([http://catholicnick.blogspot.com/2011/12/filioque-proved-in-revelation-221.html](http://catholicnick.blogspot.com/2011/12/filioque-proved-in-revelation-221.html)). I am not sure if he conveniently put the word ""proceeding"" in there, and it's important to note that Catholics believe that the ""the river of the water of life"" is the Holy Spirit. But, it is not explicitly stated that it is the Holy Spirit. I believe that ""the river of the water of life"" can represent salvation, and I will elaborate more on this point in the fourth paragraph

For argument's sake, let's say the word ""proceeding' was really in Revelation 22:1, and that the river really is the Holy Spirit. Obviously, the Holy Spirit would proceed from God's throne, as we all can agree on that the Holy Spirit does proceed from the Father. Since Revelation is the last book in the Bible, it would make sense that the Lamb would be there with the Father because Jesus had already ascended into Heaven and would now be at the right hand of the Father for all of eternity. But remember, Jesus is begotten, God is not begotten. So, it would make sense that at the end of the Bible you see the Lamb with the Father. This certainly highlights that The Son can send the Spirit, but there is no evidence to point to that says that the Spirit proceeds from the Son. In John 15:16, Jesus specifically says that the Spirit proceeds from the Father, and then in the Old Testament in Isaiah 48:16 it says that God and the Holy Spirit will send the son. These two verses come before Jesus' death and resurrection. Also, didn't God send the Holy Spirit down as a dove after Jesus' Baptism to say to everyone, ""By the way guys, this is my Son.""

I interpret the water flowing in the river in Revelation 22:1 as representing salvation, because the Son is there, and the Son is necessary for Salvation because Jesus had to die for our sins so anyone can have a chance at salvation. The River of Life flowing from the throne of the Father and the Lamb highlights that now that the Son has died for our sins, resurrected, ascended into Heaven, and now sits at the right hand of the Father, that we now have a chance at eternal life. 

Also, John 16:7-8 stood out to me, and it says: ""**7** But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. **8** When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment"" ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A7-8&amp;version=NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A7-8&amp;version=NIV)). This stood out to me because it is saying that the Spirit will not come to his Apostles until Jesus goes to Heaven. This highlights that Jesus does not have exclusive jurisdiction over the Holy Spirit because if he did, the Spirit could be there when Jesus is on earth because Jesus said so. This highlights that the Spirit originates with the Father and the Father has supreme jurisdiction over it. 

While I agree with Catholics that Peter was the leader of the apostles, disciples such as Paul would call Peter out when he wasn't right. For example, Paul called Peter out when Peter didn't want to eat with the Gentiles. So, it's therefore ok to call Peter's successors out. When the Eastern bishops called the Pope out for the Filioque, the Pope just dismissed there concerns and cut them off. Peter recognized that he could be wrong at times, therefore shouldn't the Bishop of Rome be willing to recognize that they can be wrong? If the Bishops of Rome perpetuates heresy and refuses to reform, then schism is inevitable. 

Please let me know if my reasoning makes sense, or if I am misunderstanding some things. Thanks!",OrthodoxChristianity

Would I be able to start writing about Orthodoxy now or should I wait until I become a full member of the church?

Academia's ignorance of Eastern Christianity?,Oil_Paint_Girl,1594660378,"I'm a student and a religious studies major. I have to say, something that continually perplexes me is how indifferent academia is to Eastern Christianity. At one point in class, we read an excerpt from a widely acclaimed author who had written about the relationship between Copts and Muslims in Egypt, and then went on to discuss ""the Eastern Orthodox"", among which she counted Coptics, Maronites, Armenians, Ethiopians and Assyrians (as well as Greeks and Russians). I would think that for a writer discussing Western hegemony and writing an entire chapter on Coptic Christians, she would know the distinction between Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox.

That academics who write books on Christianity cannot differentiate between Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Church of the East is baffling. Usually, academics will briefly nod to the ""Eastern Orthodox"" (by which they mean everyone who is not Roman Catholic or Protestant) before going on to discuss in length Protestant and Catholic ideologies. I have read academics who state that the Armenian Church believes that Christ is a single, divine nature. No one seems to understand or be interested in teaching about the history of Christians living as minorities outside of the West.

More often, they briefly acknowledge that Eastern Christianity is a thing, then promptly ignore it for the rest of their text.

What is the Orthodox View on Race Reparations?,MatrixMan43,1594647683,"I'm struggling about whether I have, as a white person, an obligation to repay people of color with all that's going on right now and I want to know the Orthodox truth so I that I may follow the true faith. Some of my college friends vehemently believe it's the morally correct thing to do. I came across the [Why Are We Talking About Rabbits? podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1150730) and John Heers (brother of Fr. Peter Heers) seems to not think so, as he looks at it in a Pre-Enlightenment versus Post-Enlightenment way. I've included excerpts of the podcast transcription for your interest.

*The following comes from the second podcast in the series entitled* [""Venmo, Race Reparations, and the Heart.""](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1150730/4272260-venmo-race-reparations-and-the-heart)

""

Last week, we talked about the light people. Those are folks who are bound up by this sort of ligament (*lig*), called the Enlightenment. It's a movement that aspires to understand all things using reason and experience; rationalism and empiricism. Everybody out there is probably this person. White people were the first light people. They just were. It’s a hiccup of history. Maybe, I don't know - I mean, maybe it was because of their pigmentation. It seems odd but white people in Europe were the first light people. And 300 years later most of us are now light people, even when we’re not white people. White, black, brown, red - all these racial divisions we now believe to be true - well, those were created by the light people. By scientists wielding a very, very heavy (and rather dull) axe. In many ways, we are now suffering from this very bad attempt to make the brain the king of the body and the brain the king of the heart.

And that brings me to Venmo. Yeah, Venmo. Venmo is a money app (CashApp is another one). There's a bunch of them. It's a thing that allows me to send you money easily.

So, recently I've been included on a string of emails about Venmo and it comes from an organization that's trying to - I won't name them - but they're trying to do something that in the email they call “supporting black people and communities today and into the future.” That's the string we're on. We’re on this string because we've worked with them and they're cool - I mean, I got no problems with them. Except for this email string is tortured and torturing!

Okay, the string goes like this. First, from the person who's clearly in charge. I think she's white. But, I can't really tell - it's not important, okay? But the person in authority is trying to create policy and she says this in one of the emails. Quote:

&gt;“As I mentioned in last week's email thread, I am redirecting my donation directly to colleagues of color. I invite my white colleagues to join me in compensating colleagues of color for the disproportionate amount of emotional social and intellectual labor they contribute to this flourishing community.”

It's nice. Then this boss type person continues. Quote:

&gt;“To my colleagues of color: thank you for your in ordinate amount of work - the work you do on behalf of your white community members. We acknowledge that we cannot repay you sufficiently for the time and energy you expend on behalf of this community. We offer what we can with gratitude for who you are and all that you do and all that you carry.”

Okay. This boss person - this person who's started the email string then continues:

&gt;“To the people of color: if you'd like to receive funds, please reply all with your payment info.”

Okay. Woah. So, “if you're a person of color, send me your Venmo.” And then she continues. Quote:

&gt;“To my white colleagues: if you'd like to join me in making payments to colleagues of color, please use the payment information provided by them and send money directly to those individuals. When sending money, *please be clear with yourself* and whomever you're paying.”

Okay. “When sending money please be clear with yourself.” This is excellent. Because, now, behind this effort of sort of personal reparations she's … if it’s he or she, I do know, but I just I don't care, but it's out there, right. I just don't want to identify who this person is. It's not important. But it is important what this email string is saying, \[which is\] “be clear with yourself, white people.” And then, she lists what to be clear about. It's going to get interesting, deep.

&gt;Is this going to be a one-time payment or ongoing?  
Will the amount vary over time?  
How frequently will payments to people of color be made?  
Is there an end date or are payments indefinite?  
How will you communicate if and when your willingness or ability to make payments to people of color has changed?

That's the “clear” part that folks need to get in line and get cleared out in their head. And that's the end of the letter. The boss person who is writing this signs off with the word “best” and then their name and their title. And then I won't even get into how many people Venmo and there's all these arguments about who should get it.

It's fascinating, right? The person who wrote this is a person with a title “Master of Divinity.” Let me just say that part again. The person writing this has a master's degree in divine stuff. Now, what do you think of when you think of divine stuff? I think soul, spirit…. I don't know maybe God… things true but unseen. I got friends and they're perfectly smart and they're perfectly able to think about things divine. You know what they think of? \[They think of a\] Spaghetti monster in the sky. That actually makes sense to me, that they might think of that. But Venmo? Yeah. Divinity and spirit and heart and emotions – they all go together on this one, don't they? God is sort of like a giant, good “feeling,” right? Maybe up in the sky; maybe in your heart. But in Venmo?

*... (the following comes from much later in the podcast, but I included it because the ideas are deeply interesting to me)...*

Sherrard, in *Rape of Man and Nature* says, “There is in us, a difference between our inmost self and the self which I mistakenly call my everyday thinking self.” He says, “it may be that modern man has a split awareness, and that his everyday thinking self has become impervious to and incapable of communing with his inner self, his *nous*.” This, he goes on to say, “is the illness of modernity.” It is what depression looks like, and it is the cause of deep dislocation and utter dissatisfaction with the world around us. We try and get satisfied with stuff. We consume.

As an incredible Romanian writer on the passions, Dimitru Staniloae says, “objects by nature are finite, they pass easily into nonexistence, by consumption. And when a human is seen as an object, as a thing, material only in nature, well, the unfathomable depths hidden in that person escape us.”

"My thought is Hagia Sophia, as an Atheist Turk.",seekingthepoint,1594636831,"I think it should have remained a museum, neither church or mosque. It served both for Muslims and Christians for hundreds of years and it  inevitably absorbed both cultures. Though, I see the move of one of Greek ministers of proposing to  turning the historical house of Atatürk into a ""genocide museum"" to be a bit contradictory to Christian both side since, although he had mistakes(he was a human) he was the one who converted it to a from a mosque to a museum. 

 To be honest, many Turks don't have a quite concrete opinion on the issue except for viewing it as an unnecessary move to distract the topic from more important issues like economic problems, immigration etc. Hagia Sophia being converted to a mosque won't make a huge change in my personal life. Even when I was a Muslim, I had never been to a mosque except for once when I was 9 or 10 for the Ramadan prayer. There are already millions of pretty empty mosques here, so, adding Hagia Sophia to them wouldn't make much of an effect. I think the only way in which it would affect many people's lives would be several Europen countries' relations getting  worse with Turkey, which would affect the Erasmus agreements for students and lecturers(sad). Though, I have already given up Europe and heading for the more secular, irreligious Northern United States, so, not really.

Augustine on the true church and its persecution,georglukacs,1594631017,"
2. ""Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up"" Psalm 128:1. The Church speaks of those whom She endures: and as if it were asked, ""Is it now?"" The Church is of ancient birth: since saints have been so called, the Church has been on earth. At one time the Church was in Abel only, and he was fought against by his wicked and lost brother Cain. Genesis 4:8 At one time the Church was in Enoch alone: and he was translated from the unrighteous. Genesis 5:24 At one time the Church was in the house of Noah alone, and endured all who perished by the flood, and the ark alone swam upon the waves, and escaped to shore. Genesis vi.-viii At one time the Church was in Abraham alone, and we know what he endured from the wicked. The Church was in his brother's son, Lot, alone, and in his house, in Sodom, and he endured the iniquities and perversities of Sodom, until God freed him from amidst them. Genesis xiii.-xx The Church also began to exist in the people of Israel: She endured Pharaoh and the Egyptians. The number of the saints began to be also in the Church, that is, in the people of Israel; Moses and the rest of the saints endured the wicked Jews, the people of Israel. We come unto our Lord Jesus Christ: the Gospel was preached in the Psalms.. ..For this reason, lest the Church wonder now, or lest any one wonder in the Church, who wishes to be a good member of the Church, let him hear the Church herself his Mother saying to him, Marvel not at these things, my son: ""Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up.""

Ways in which communion is distributed among churches,hipsterbeard12,1594594920,"There is a wide variety of ways communion is currently distributed and I was curious if anyone knows about how each church tends to do it.

Byzantine liturgical practice is for major clerics to commune the bread and wine separately and use a spoon with both for everyone else.

I think the Armenians use the same practice but I'm not sure.

Roman liturgical practice is to have everyone commune with either just the bread on the tongue or in the hand or bread and wine separately.

I believe some Antiochians, Melkites, and Maronites have the priest dip the bread into the wine and then place it in the mouth of the people.  

I've heard that the Copts use a napkin but I am not really sure of the method.

I have no idea what Ethiopian or Chalcedonian practice is.

 I recently got baptized so I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence for the newly baptized to feel unworthy for seemingly no reason whatsoever or if it's a spiritual attack of some sorts or just a side effect of the depression I've been struggling with for some time or what. Anyway if any of y'all have had similar troubles or know if I can recieve communion tomorrow or anything that would help me understand preparation for communion better I would greatly appreciate it.

History, as we know, repeats itself twice: the first time in the form of tragedy, the second — in the form of farce.

The first time this happened was in the 15th century, when Constantinople, seeking the military support of Rome against the Turks, signed the Florentine Union with the Roman Catholic Church in 1439, recognizing the Latin heretics and their changes in the dogmas of the faith and Creed. The Patriarch of Constantinople, who approved these innovations, died 8 days later and did not live to sign the Union itself.

The Byzantine clergy and common people did not accept heresy, and Church turmoil reigned in Constantinople for 12 years. Russia also refused to recognize heresy and expelled from Moscow the Patriarch of Kiev and all Russia, Isidore, who was appointed by Constantinople, and who fled to Rome, where he became a Catholic cardinal. But in 1452, Isidore was sent as a legate of Pope Nicholas 5 to Constantinople, where on December 12, 1452, the Union was still officially proclaimed in the Hagia Sophia in the presence of the Emperor, clergy and laity…

The following year, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks, and the Vatican did not lift a finger to help it. The Byzantine Empire ceased to exist forever, and Saint Sophia was turned into a Muslim mosque and overgrown with minarets.

\* \* \*

Five and a half centuries have passed, and history has repeated itself as a farce.

Istanbul (Constantinople) Patriarch Bartholomew, enlisting the support of the West, caused a split in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. And helped him in this... exiled from Moscow dissenter, ungrateful impostor-false Patriarch ""Kiev and all Russia-Ukraine"" Filaret. Moscow, just as it did five centuries ago, broke off relations with the schismatics, and Church unrest reigned in Ukraine.

January 6, 2019 in Istanbul patr. Bartholomew and the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church of Constantinople issued a document on the cancellation of the Synodal letter of 1686 on the transfer of the Kiev metropolis to the Moscow Patriarchate and on the granting of autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (the ""Tomos"").

And the following year... on June 10, 2020, a Turkish court overturned Kemal Ataturk's 1934 decision to grant Hagia Sophia the status of a Museum. And now the greatest Christian Shrine of Byzantium will again become a Muslim mosque, and again from its minarets the muezzins will sing, proclaiming shame to the schismatic Bartholomew. And no West, of course, will lift a finger to help him.",OrthodoxChristianity

Background: For reasons that are too long to write here, I (25M) am currently attending an old-school non-denominational Charismatic church despite my (secret) wish to convert to Orthodoxy. My grandfather started the church, and my dad has begun preaching in the last 5 years as well...

I mentioned to my dad about possibly speaking one evening at Bible study about ancient heresies, the ecumenical councils, and how these heresies have re-emerged in the modern era. He seemed very supportive of the idea, and I was very excited. Well...

He and I had dinner this evening, and I was going into the specifics of what I would cover - just to ensure he was okay with everything. We were going well talking about Gnosticism, modalism, Arianism... then we got to Nestorius... I tried to explain ""Theotokos"" versus ""Christotokos"" and what they actually meant (despite what it may read as in English)...

My dad fully supported Nestorianism. He did not like the title ""Theotokos"" because it is commonly translated to ""Mother of God."" I explained that it was affirmed the full divinity and fully humanity of Christ rather than diminishing His divinity even as a newborn...

I said... ""Well, you don't disagree with their ruling, and yet you do. This title of Theotokos goes back to at least 250 A.D. It was present in a Greek manuscript of a Coptic liturgy."" He said ""These councils can be just as fallible. They made a decision to go down a path that allowed pagan influence to enter the church and promote praying to Mary and worshipping Mary.""

From there, we spiraled into how Revelation was not interpreted right and how the Biblical canon wasn't correct until the seven apocryphal books were removed... I said ""It sounds as those you're suggesting that we now have an additional dispensation of knowledge to properly interpret Scripture, and past Christians didn't have that..."" (I didn't tell him how strongly that resembled Gnostic ideas.) He says ""Well, yes, I do believe that.""

I had to stop there.

This year I took the family to the Greek festival and while she loved the food, she was very disinterested in the whole thing.

Accounts of some of the long-lost miraculous portable icons of the Hagia Sophia,javiar123,1594420594,"I read about such icons in the past but cannot find the link to it anymore, but here is some excerpts from a book preview which talks about historical accounts:

---

**[The Narthex](https://i.imgur.com/9u9Inc5.png):**

**The icon of the Theotokos that spake to Saint Mary of Egypt as she prayed to it**

&gt;""From this Justinian Column you enter the doors of Hagia Sophia, the first doors. Going a little farther, past the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth doors, and thus it is that by the seventh doors you enter the Great Church of Hagia Sophia. When we came to the great doors, [on the right-hand side] we venerated the miraculous icon of the All-pure Mother of God from which the voice went out to Saint Mary of Egypt forbidding her entrance into the Holy Church in Jerusalem."" [They moved the icon from the Narthex of the Holy Sepulcher that Mary had prayed to, and moved it to the Narthex of the Hagia Sophia]

In the old link where I read about this, it mentioned this icon was popular with repentant harlots. 

""On solemn occasions the patriarch venerated this icon before entering the nave of the Great Church to conduct services.""

""The flooring of the front of the suggested image was replaced in Byzantine times, probably because the marble floor had become worn from people approaching the wall to kiss the icon displayed there""

Nearby was an icon of Saint Mary of Egypt as well.

**The Imperial Door (made from wood of Noah's Ark)**

&gt;""You enter the Hagia Sophia from the narthex by the central west doors on the right. The doors of Noah's ark. . . are near these doors, on the left. . . Christians worship at these doors, for healing comes from them.""

""The central doors from the narthex to the nave of the church (the ""great doors"" mentioned by Ignatius) were not available for ordinary use. Their use was restricted to the patriarch and the imperial entourage on important occasions, whence their name, the ""imperial doors"". The central doors themselves were also an object of veneration.  Although they were covered with metal plates, as were the other doors, according to tradition they were wrought from the precious wood of Noah's Ark, as the Russian Anonymus, Alexander, and Zosima attest, although the original Justinianic doors were apparently carried off by the Latins in the theirteenth century and later replaced. The tradition that the imperial doors were made of the wood of Noah's Ark, however, lived on, and not only among the Russian visitors. The present doors were installed as part of the repairs done by the Fossati brothers in the nineteenth century.""

**Confessor Savior**

On the left-hand side of the Imperial Doors, there was an icon called ""Confessor Savior"".

&gt;""I kissed the image of our Lord Jesus Christ before which people confess their sins when they cannot confess them before a father confessor because of shame; it is called the 'Confessor Savior'""

""Again, the floor seems to have been ruined by constant traffic of people kissing the icon. . . Alexander's description of the image as marble might signify a bas-relief image, or, more likely, a mosaic icon. Old Russian texts often confuse the words 'marble' and 'mosaic'""

**[West End of the Nave, above the Imperial Doors]((https://i.imgur.com/61zS3vh.png))**

**Great image of the Savior [(Chalke style?)]**

&gt;Going a little father [from the central doors], and turning toward the west, you will see an icon of the holy Savior standing up over the doors there. The story of this icon is recounted in books which we cannot quote, but, [briefly,], a pagan iconoclast put up a ladder, hoping to rip the golden crown off [the icon]. Saint Theodosia overturned the ladder and killed the pagan, and the saint was killed there with a goat horn"". ""We also venerated the image of the Lord inside the holy church and the [other] venerable holy icons].

""Above the imperial doors of the Great Church, on the nave side, at least two of the later Russian pilgrims remarked on the great image of the Savior. It's location is indicated quite clearly by Stephen, since he notes that after a worshiper has entered the church he must turn around and look to the west to see this image. Similarly, the Russian Anonymus records that a visitor sees this icon above the imperial doors only after he has entered the church. It is doubtless this ""holy image"" of the Savior above the ""beautiful doors"" which, according to Symeon of Thessalonice, the patriarch bows three times, saying, ""We venerate thine immaculate image,"" after he has solemnly entered the church through the imperial doors and blessed the congregation. The patriarch turns to the west to venerate this image. Stephen connects this image with the story of St. Theodosia's defense of the icon of the Savior at the Chalke Gate at the imperial palace . . .

An Orthodox College Student's Experience with Philosophy and the Soul,MatrixMan43,1594405408,"1.1 Introduction and Main Points

Prior to COVID-19, a college campus was an interesting place. Undoubtedly, the experience broadens perspectives much beyond the focus of ones’ studies, and I believe that college is a useful place to learn. However, the college student’s path to knowledge and wisdom is not completed within a four year course of study. In this medium, I’ll try to connect ideas from my learning, a recent episode of the *Why Are We Talking About Rabbits?* (WAWTAR) podcast entitled ""Let's Talk About Race,"" and my experience in a college philosophy course. This essay’s main points are as follows:

* The Enlightenment philosophy of rationalism sets the mind above the heart - the *nous*
* Setting the mind above the *nous* silences it, as it allows rational thinkers to:
   * Ignore it
   * Justify evil
* My peers in my college philosophy course had a mixed response when asked if they felt thepurification of the soul was still relevant today
* Some students felt that their souls weren’t worth listening to or attempting to purify...
   * In this way, they simply ignored the *nous*
   * Some students reported that soul purification was still relevant, but it was entirely relative to the person...
   * This idea can lead to the moral justification of evildoing or the following of ideology
   * Solzhenitsyn wrote about how the Bluecaps of 20th century Russia used justification and ideology to participate in the torture and murder of millions of innocent people
* **Ultimately, the rationalism of the Enlightenment has, in part, produced lasting, detrimental effects on the** ***nous***

1.2 Knowledge and Reality

During my 3rd year at a public university, I enrolled in a Philosophy course entitled, “Knowledge and Reality.” In this class, we studied Hume’s empiricism, Descartes’s rationalism, and Socrates teachings. I found the class quite interesting and thought-provoking. One aspect of the course that I found particularly curious was the professor’s austerely objective presentation of the material. I wondered whether the professor had any opinion or deeper perspective on these important and foundational philosophical topics, because if he did have such opinions, he never provided them. Instead, the professor stayed neutral on the topics and helped students to best understand the material, not his opinions.

At the time, I admired the professor for doing this. He encouraged our class to *think* for ourselves! Likewise, challenging us students be free in our interpretations encouraged us to create our own rationales on these foundational ideas of western society. How powerful I now felt! Here, my reasoning ability was elevated to the highest position.

This security and power my reasoning ability now had was doubly enforced by two truisms I’d learned from college. First, college taught me that, on a subjective topic, my own opinion is always the right answer. Second, on philosophical topics (which are usually treated subjectively nowadays) if my reasoning is sound, my answer cannot be called into question. Thus, in this class, I had no incentive to use anything but my *mind* \- my reasoning ability - to philosophize. Why would I use anything else (if anything else even existed! I was taught to think) if my rationale alone would suffice?

What John said in that first podcast, however, broadened my aperture. Is it possible that my ability to reason is fallible? Well, I’ve been wrong before … but maybe I just reasoned incorrectly? But what about those times when I reasoned correctly but came up short and couldn’t reach an answer? Most notably, I thought of the time I realized that life mainly consisted of repetitive suffering mixed with moments of happiness. I realized that happiness was always fleeting while death was constantly approaching. Why, then, did people continue to choose life, if only to face terrible suffering? Was it pointless? I thought. Or did God exist, and so there was, perhaps, a point to all this suffering?

This was not a question I could find the answer to using my exalted reasoning ability alone. No matter how hard I tried. This was inconvenient!

1.2.1 The nous

Remember the term *nous* from the podcast. John says, “\[The *nous*\] is the intellect of the soul … That thing (the *nous*) is the proper mix of both intellect and spirit - it's the thing in you that allows you to see clearly.” The *nous* can be described as a window to and from heaven. In this way, each individual’s window (*nous*) show the same truths, but not everybody’s window (*nous*) is equally clear.

Maintaining the *nous*\-window analogy here, the *nous* is subject to fogging. It also has a set of heavy curtains in front of it, and some venetian blinds behind that. Typically, there’s an abundance of maintenance work that needs to be done on it. As I live my comfortable life, I don’t worry about it, though. I rarely even open the blinds since my mind usually suffices to solve all my worldly problems. In fact, its commonplace for the blinds to be drawn and the curtains be draped over the *nous* such that barely any light gets through at all. If any did, it is from the window dirt. It’s easier for me if I don’t think about fixing it, so I just continue living comfortably in darkness. Every once and awhile, however, the light on the other side of the *nous* is so strong that it bursts through the defenses and I can do nothing but pay attention to it.

This tired analogy was meant to say that each person has this window to reality that is a part of their soul. Few choose to look through the window, though, because it takes so much work to get there. The amazing part is that the view from each person’s window is the same thing – reality. Remember, the window is the *nous*.

The hardest part of learning to listen to the *nous* is that it takes humility. You have to say, “I don’t have all the answers. My mind is fallible. I am morally imperfect.”

1.3 Purification of the Soul

Back to the philosophy class. A large part of each student’s grade was their contribution to class-wide, online forums. Each week, students were required to 1) respond to a prompt about the passage we had just read and 2) reply to a fellow student’s response. Importantly, students were not allowed to see anybody else’s response before submitting their own.

This forum was held entirely online, and thus, I still have full access to it. After listening to the first WAWTAR podcast, entitled “Let’s Talk About Race,” I revisited one forum in particular. The forum prompt was as follows:

&gt;Plato talks about purification of the soul as a worthy goal of any philosopher.  
Do you think this notion of purification is relevant to our lives today? Why or why not? Using an example can really help you readers understand how you view the issue.

The weight of this question cannot be understated. It would seem that the individual responses would be somewhat reflective of that individual’s worldview. In retrospect, this was an interesting scenario: students were encouraged to use rationalism to decide whether or not the purification of their soul was necessary.

Isn’t this, in a way, “moving the location of heaven from the heart to the head?” How can us 20 year-olds use our still-developing minds to answer a question that is so innate? Personally, I *feel* when my soul needs to purified. This feeling is something that at times comes as an overwhelming and deep feeling of contrition. The only ways I’ve been able to “hush” this feeling in the past is through 1) reasoning it away or 2) letting time pass without thinking about it.

1.4 Nous Suppression Tactics

1.4.1 Using Reason to Silence the Nous

The first method I mentioned, using reason to silence the *nous*, is what I found John to be talking about in the WAWTAR podcast when he discusses how Enlightenment thinkers translocated the mind to be “above the heart.”

What does using reason to silence a feeling of contrition look like? For one, it can look like nihilism – “well, we’ll all die anyways. What does it even matter that I feel bad about something I’ve done?” I’ve also found that contrition can be silenced by trying to justify whatever evil action is making you feel bad about yourself (because it’s really not a very *nice* feeling). In *The Gulag Archipelago,* Alexander Solzhenitsyn discusses the logical course through which man continually does evil:

&gt;To do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he’s doing is good, or else that it’s a well-considered act in conformity with natural law. Fortunately, it is in the nature of the human being to seek a justification for his actions.  
:  
Ideology—that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others’ eyes, so that he won’t hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise and honors. That was how the agents of the Inquisition fortified their wills: by invoking Christianity; the conquerors of foreign lands, by extolling the grandeur of their Mother-land; the colonizers, by civilization; the Nazis, by race; and the Jacobins (early and late), by equality, brotherhood, and the happiness of future generations.

Historically, men and women have had little trouble justifying evil. But for us habitual evildoers, we need something more concrete to silence our *nous* and validate our sinning – so we turn to ideology. By finding an ideology that fits your needs, the feeling of contrition can be silenced by shifting the goal posts. You can go through life justifying your evil just as the interrogators in the Russian prison system (“the Bluecaps”) did as they partook in the torture and killing of 60 million Russians. Here, the rational mind of the Enlightenment silenced the *nous* of the Old World.

1.4.2 Absence of Thought as a Means of Silencing the Nous

The other way I’ve successfully hushed my soul’s plea for purification is by ignoring it. This is, in ways, much less pleasant than using justifications, since it takes constant work on my part. From my waking moment, I hear my *nous* yelling at me, and it hurts my pride. It’s emotionally uncomfortable. I almost come to acknowledge my faults and I almost schedule a confession. But then, I remember my proficiency in distraction tactics (social media, TV, video games, YouTube, etc.). Using these tactics, I silence my *nous* and stow it in some place where I won’t hear from it for a while. In *The Gulag Archipelago,* Solzhenitsyn discusses how the Bluecaps were able to justify the torturing of innocent Russians simply by not thinking about it deeply:

&gt;They understood that the cases were fabricated, yet they kept on working year after year. How could they? Either they forced themselves not to think (and this in itself means the ruin of a human being), and simply accepted that this was the way it had to be and that the person who gave them their orders was always right . . .

Interestingly, Solzhenitsyn calls this particular tactic the “ruin of a human being.” It is thus doubly sad that myself and my peers are so practised in it. As a sidenote, the Bluecaps and enforcers of totalitarianism were devastated when they became the next generation of political prisoners in the gulags.

1.4.3 In Reason We Trust

In summary, these are two ways (possibly, of many) through which the mind silences the *nous* amidst evildoing: 1) rationalism and 2) absence of thought. Through these methods, I’ve found that by elevating the mind above the *nous*, exiling your apprehension of contrition becomes a simple and straightforward matter. Sadly, I am skilled at finding some ideology that fits my needs or at practicing willful ignorance.

Is there anyway I can use only my mind to come to the harrowing conclusion that the purification of my soul is necessary? Perhaps there is, but I don’t believe I’ve traveled down it successfully. I’ve found that this particular path of rational thought – the one leading to the conclusion that my soul must be purified - is not only difficult to travel alone but also requires an entrance fee that makes it almost inaccessible.

This entrance fee includes procuring humility, where I have to acknowledge that I was not only wrong but also individually incapable of purifying my soul all on my own. These ideas are contrary to my deeply ingrained understanding of how great I am!

If I somehow manage to pay this fee, I find that traveling down the road requires tremendous stamina, as I need to understand the depth of my own depravity without asking, “Do I need antidepressants?” Of course, there are countless other obstacles on this road. It’s not easy. I usually arrive at the question, “Why must I sit here and suffer with my faults when there’s no logical end in sight?” At this point, feeling that I deserve a break, I quickly hop on the couch and start watching sports, not to revisit the entrance gate for a couple months or so.

1.5 The Class’s Understanding of the Soul

After making these observations, I am now quite interested in what my classmates have to say. I took the easy way out, starting my response with the best I could think of, which was:

&gt;The purification of the soul is universally important. This belief is one I hold as an Orthodox Christian – that the purification of the soul is a means to creating or maintaining a relationship with God.

In a class of 27 students, I was expecting immensely diverse perspectives. A key aspect of this class was the class demographic, since very few, if any, of the students were philosophy majors. Thus, these students were not well-trained in what they should or should not believe on the issue, making for especially unique and genuine responses. Surely, there will be many disagreements on such a divisive topic in today’s “mixing pot” American culture, I thought.

As I expected, the content of the responses were diverse. This held true except for 10 students; 4 students identified that purification, interpreted as removing sin from the soul, was relevant today and 6 people explicitly responded that they believed any sort of purification of the soul was not at all relevant.

1.5.1 The “No” Response

Below are some excerpts from the responses of those who said that the purification of the soul was not important. The first one seems to be reverberating hedonism:

&gt;I don't believe that people or myself are willing to give up pleasures because ultimately the belief of having the soul separated from the body while we are alive is not what people are most concerned about.

This next one was particularly nihilistic:

&gt;A popular question that people ask in order to know more than the surface is, ""Is the cup half full or half empty?"". The cup of water does not carry a meaning or future. It is what it is. The cup has water; that's it.

Efficiency is key to this response:

&gt;I do believe that there is no sense in fearing what awaits in the afterlife, after all it is unknown what awaits so fearing such a thing would be a waste of energy. 

I wonder if this response would still hold today, during the pandemic and rioting:

&gt;By separating the soul from your body, you are not truly experiencing the world as it is.  I think that purity is not being separate, but being one with the world around you. Instead of shunning the soul, allowing it to ebb and flow with the tidings of your daily life and the world around you.

I included the entirety of the following response because it broadened my perspective on how college students think:

&gt;I do not think that purification is relevant to our lives today due to the evolution of mankind. Over time, the concepts that linked our bodies to our ""souls"" in the first place such as religion, the gods, karma, etc., has slowly faded away, and has instead been replaced by science and technology. With the rise of technology and social media, people have lost contact with their souls, or even the concept of having a soul. Plato speaks of situations in which we are so sucked into an intellectual problem that we lose all sense of our physical bodies and the world around us. In today's society, it is impossible to be that unattached unless you were to go out of your way and lose contact with all that is important to you -- your daily texts with your best friend, your mom, or your significant other. Since it would be this difficult to lose touch with the world, it is not realistic, and therefore irrelevant to our lives today. 

I included these to simply show how some college students in my class genuinely thought. It reminded me of the prevalence of rationalism in today’s society. Likewise, these responses were a wakeup call to me. Nihilism and hedonism are not some distant and forgotten ideas, but are instead still very alive today in my peers.

1.5.2 The Morally Relativistic Response

Continuing, 15 students agreed with the idea that purification was still relevant, but each one of these responses contained at least one of the following characteristics:

1. The level of relevance is determined by the individual i.e. I could choose that soul purification was relevant to me, but that wouldn’t mean it was relevant to you
2. The thing being purified is determined by the individual (usually taking some worldly, superficial form, like taking a break from social media)

To give you an idea, these responses typically carried following sentiment:

&gt;People's definitions of purity differ but I do think the essence and meaning of it all is incredibly relevant in our lives today.

This was interesting. I expected moral relativism would be prevalent, but I did not expect that it would be present in the majority of these *original* responses.

Remember that students had to respond to another person’s original prompt response. In this way, you could see which student responses were most popular and which most students agreed with. What were the moral relativists agreeing with? 4 students chose to write about how they were in agreement with the following paragraph:

&gt;I think this notion of purification is just as relevant as it is today, however, it of course goes by different names. While reading this passage, I instantly thought of Meditation, but I also thought of what is known as 'social media detoxes'. Both have the goal of removing what occupies our daily life, in order to spend more time with yourself, or namely your soul.

Ultimately, the majority of students felt that soul purification was still relevant today, but the terms of the whole process were relevant only to the individual.

1.6 Takeaways

21 of the 27 students used their original, rational thought to answer the prompt and came to the conclusions that soul purification either:

1. Wasn’t relevant today
2. Was relevant but up to the individual

Don’t these conclusions fall in line with how the Bluecaps and myself previously used our minds to silence our souls? These methods being:

1. Ignoring the nous’s screaming for contrition
2. Justifying evildoing by re-aligning personal moral standards

The point is that elevating the mind above the *nous* silences it. The Enlightenment had thus set in motion this exodus of the *nous*and the lasting effects were clearly shown in this forum.

As John made clear in the podcast: this isn’t about wanting to be more in touch with one’s emotions. This essay is coming from an engineering student - somebody who firmly believes that emotions must be held in check when making important decisions. I’m also one to stifle my emotion when having important conversations. And typically, I try not to listen to my emotions before getting a morning workout in.

But, I’ve been lucky to have made mistakes that I could not reason away; mistakes which I couldn’t complete my mental gymnastics routine on. And those have shown me that my reliance on my mind silences my the thing in me that sees clearly – the *nous*. Thus, when my *nous* is telling me I messed up, I listen to it and do something about it.

To summarize, this essay’s main points were:

* The Enlightenment philosophy of rationalism sets the mind above the heart - the *nous*
* Setting the mind above the *nous* silences it, as it allows rational thinkers to:
   * Ignore it
   * Justify evil
* My peers in my college philosophy course had a mixed response when asked if they felt thepurification of the soul was still relevant today
* Some students felt that their souls weren’t worth listening to or attempting to purify...
   * In this way, they simply ignored the *nous*
   * Some students reported that soul purification was still relevant, but it was entirely relative to the person...
   * This idea can lead to the moral justification of evildoing or the following of ideology
   * Solzhenitsyn wrote about how the Bluecaps of 20th century Russia used justification and ideology to participate in the torture and murder of millions of innocent people
* **Ultimately, the rationalism of the Enlightenment has, in part, produced lasting, detrimental effects on the** ***nous***

1.7 One Last Point: Group-Think

Another interesting aspect of this forum was the level of agreement the students had with each other when posting their replies to other students. This was especially remarkable considering the level of diversity some students had in their original responses on this enormously important issue.

More than two-thirds of the students agreed with some other student in the class. To my surprise, 7 of the 27 students had to resort to using emphatic literary devices when describing their level of agreement. Here are some excerpts from the students’ replies to each other:

&gt;§ I agree with you that purification today comes in many different ways to many different people.  
§ I think it is very true that lifestyles are starting to change (maybe for the better) for people to have a clearer conscience and more ""pure"" life. Great response!  
§ I didn't even think of it through this lens when reading but it is very true.  
§ I didn't even think about the materialistic and lustful aspects of human nature, but I totally agree.  
§ I definitely agree with you about how the modes of motivation of purifications are likely different.  
§ I completely agree. (this sentiment was included in 11 others)  
§ I agree with you that pursuing happiness is something that gives us a feeling of purification.

It should be noted here that the majority of the replies in agreement were directed between the moral relativists (perhaps because everything, they felt, was relative, and a “yes” or “no” answer is much too dictating). The students who disagreed with others sometimes responded like this:

&gt;In our society today, I don't think that one necessarily has to ""train for dying"" to completely purify their souls, but I do think that living a simple life (like Minimalists do) can lead to living a ""pure"" life. People should strive to lead a good, happy life that benefits society!

What are the ramifications on cultural movements when people are so quick to find agreement on such a fundamental idea, even when their original responses were completely different in ideas? How deeply do all of the students hold their beliefs? Here is Solzhenitsyn, discussing how the Bluecaps were able to justify the torturing of innocent Russians by simply following the “Party”:

&gt;Or else it was a matter of the Progressive Doctrine, granite ideology. An interrogator in awful Orotukan—sent there to the Kolyma in 1938 as a penalty assignment—was so touched when M. Lurye, former director of the Krivoi Rog Industrial Complex, readily agreed to sign an indictment which meant a second camp term that he used the time they had thus saved to say: “You think we get any satisfaction from using persuasion? We have to do what the Party demands of us. You are an old Party member. Tell me what would you do in my place?” Apparently Lurye nearly agreed with him, and it may have been the fact that he had already been thinking in some such terms that led him to sign so readily. It is after all a convincing argument.

Here, political obligations are another way through which evil is justified. Perhaps a political obligation can be understood as a pressure one experiences from the group in which he or she exists. This pressure, then, is to conform to the group’s expectations. It may be a stretch, but isn’t this what my peers did when they so quickly and so emphatically agreed with each other?",OrthodoxChristianity

Prayers for laziness.,wweeww2121,1594379017,"So, I’m lazy to say the least. I don’t know what happened to me. Some time ago I would be able to study for hours and hours even after school. I would be able to spend weekends studying, going outside, be helpful to the ones around me. Now, I’m lazy as ever. I try to study, I feel like going to sleep. My temper has started to be very hot, even tho I always managed to be calm and patient, I can’t anymore.

I’m still young, and I don’t know wether all this quarantine and playing games for the longest time got me in this state, but it’s really affecting me. I can’t concentrate as I once could, my patient has went from being able to wait hours and hours and be forgiving to barely being able to pay attention 5m on something. It’s even more irritating because my temper is so hot that I may speak bad with my parents, I may get mad over a loss in a game, and I don’t like being like this. I was thinking of trying meditation, but also pray more, as they give me a certain peace, even if at times I don’t feel like to, praying helps. Lately I’ve tried studying a few days a week and managed to get some hours in a day, but I know I need to do more.

In fact, I would say laziness is my biggest issue. And even more so when I look back at my self a year ago and see just how much stuff I could get done. My grades in school thankfully stayed up, but that was probably thanks to the hard studying I did before hand and luckily it stayed in my head. But I know I can’t just go on like this. I need to start again as the next few years are incredibly important for me. Maybe I’m burned out, although I feel like games have added to the fire. My temper, patience, all got worse the more I played, and yet I keep coming back. I keep getting distracted. I keep saying one more game and it turns out to be a whole day. I honestly feel like deleting them for a week or so, get studying and reinstall them once I got my head sorted. Are there any good prayers for laziness, shortness of temper? Thank you for reading all of this, I know that it’s going to be hard to turn away from the distractions, but I’m willing to change. Stay safe everyone.",OrthodoxChristianity

St. Maximus on Roman Supremacy,BonifaceXIII,1594356702,"Greetings, I'm here again to share some more quotes, this time from one of the Greek Fathers: Saint Maximus.  


&gt; How much more in the case of the clergy and Church of the Romans, which from of old until now, as the elder of all the Churches under the sun, presides over all? 

What exactly does it mean to preside over all in the Orthodox view? To myself, it seems obvious that he is asserting a universal authority over all held by the Romans, i.e, the Roman Patriarch is the Ecumenical Patriarch with authority over the entire oecumene.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yet further, what supplication has the blessed pope, who now sits, not made? Have not the whole East and West brought their tears, laments, obsecrations, deprecations, both before God in prayer and before men in their letters? If the Roman see recognizes Pyrrhus to be not only a reprobate but a heretic, it is certainly plain that everyone who anathematizes those who have rejected Pyrrhus, anathematizes the see of Rome that is, he anathematizes the Catholic Church. I need hardly add that he excommunicates himself also, if indeed he be in communion with the Roman see and the Church of God.... It is not right that one who has been condemned and cast out by the Apostolic see of the city of Rome for his wrong opinions should be named with any kind of honour, until he be received by her, having returned to her — nay, to our Lord — by a pious confession and orthodox faith, by which he can receive holiness and the title of holy.... 

  
This is where this issue gets interesting.  If Pyrrhus is rejected by the Roman Church, and you reject those that reject Pyrrhus(Rome) you are rejecting the Catholic Church at large. That's a very high view of the Roman Church.

Confession of Dositheus (1672) and private Bible reading,Classic_Result,1594350042,"In the official response of the Orthodox Church to Calvinism, the *Confession of Dositheus* which was composed at the Jerusalem Synod of 1672, the text of which you can find [here](http://www.crivoice.org/creeddositheus.html), it is said (you can find it if you scroll all the way down past Decree 18 to find it):

&gt;Should the Divine Scriptures be read in the vulgar tongue \[common language\] by all Christians?  
&gt;  
&gt;No. Because all Scripture is divinely-inspired and profitable {*cf.* 2 Timothy 3:16}, we know, and  	necessarily so, that without \[Scripture\] it is impossible to be Orthodox at all. Nevertheless they should not be read by all, but only by those who with fitting research have inquired into the deep things of the Spirit, and who know in what manner the Divine Scriptures ought to be searched, and taught, and finally read. But to those who are not so disciplined, or who cannot distinguish, or who understand only literally, or in any other way contrary to Orthodoxy what is contained in the Scriptures, the Catholic Church, knowing by experience the damage that can cause, forbids them to read \[Scripture\]. Indeed, it is permitted to every Orthodox to hear the Scriptures, that he may believe with the heart unto righteousness, and confess with the mouth unto salvation {Romans 10:10}. But to read some parts of the Scriptures, and especially of the Old \[Testament\], is forbidden for these and other similar reasons. For it is the same thing to prohibit undisciplined persons from reading all the Sacred Scriptures, as to require infants to abstain from strong meats.  
&gt;  
&gt;Question 2  
&gt;  
&gt;Are the Scriptures plain to all Christians that read them?  
&gt;  
&gt;If the Divine Scriptures were plain to all Christians that read them, the Lord would not have commanded such as desired to obtain salvation to search them; {John 5:39} and Paul would have said without reason that God had placed the gift of teaching in the Church; {1 Corinthians 13:28} and Peter would not have said of the Epistles of Paul that they contained some things hard to be  understood. {2 Peter 3:16} It is evident, therefore, that the Scriptures are very profound, and their sense lofty; and that they need learned and divine men to search out their true meaning, and a sense that is right, and agreeable to all Scripture, and to its author the Holy Spirit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Certainly, those that are regenerated \[in Baptism\] must know the faith concerning the Trinity, the incarnation of the Son of God, His passion, resurrection, and ascension into the heavens. Yet what concerns regeneration and judgment — for which many have not hesitated to die — it is not necessary, indeed impossible, for them to know what the Holy Spirit has made apparent only to those who are disciplined in wisdom and holiness.

What's the practical implementation of this? I can see some basic good sense: the Bible's complicated, be careful, you really DO need to know what you're doing ... but even as a basic Christian self defense thing, being able to know what is in the Bible helps you hold off the people who want to tell you it says things it doesn't say.

In these days, it's like you have to have a PhD in Patristics AND have the simple, unlearned prayer of the Desert Fathers to make it into heaven. You have to know for yourself so that some super smart Reformed dude doesn't blow you out of the water with Patristic references (I tip my hat to them, though, impressive intellectual rigor), but then you have to struggle within yourself not to think that your theological library at home is going to get you into heaven. You have to be able to read between the lines of plausible arguments that are really heresy in a nice envelope but have the humility not to think you yourself can be ""the next"" St. Athanasius.

Is it historically dependent? The cheapness of modern printed materials is a positive boon, though it makes it easier to treat a Bible irreverently if it isn't on lambskin with gold foil and elaborate illumination.

In all honesty, I ignore it in practice. The fact that I don't know why I can't get myself to read the Bible regularly is another problem entirely.

What about someone in the Orthodox Church. I know about the Jesus prayer and that a lot of orthodox have a more standard (individually tailored) prayer rule.

25 “At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them were foolish and five were wise. 3 The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. 4 The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. 5 The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.

6 “At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’

7 “Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 8 The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’

9 “‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’

10 “But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.

11 “Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’

Discerning between ROCOR and ROCA?,A_ccountant,1594164517,"Hello all! I've been looking for the true faith for almost 2 years now. Having deconverted from Catholicism, I'm torn between ROCOR, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, and ROCA, the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad. Sadly, due to perceived heresy on one side and perceived schism on the other, these two bodies aren't in union. I have been talking to a ROCA priest lately and found his counsel to be deeply helpful. He reflects the love of God towards me in a beautiful way, and has helped me overcome my stress, which can become severe. 

However, I don't know if the reasons ROCA is out of union with ROCOR- mainly the actions of Metropolitan Sergius in the 1920s and perceived heresies in the form of ecumenism- are actually sufficient to warrant severing ourselves from the Moscow Patriarchate. I'm sure that more people here are part of ROCOR than ROCA, but what do you think is a good source for this? My priest, the one from ROCA, told me that simply praying enough and trusting in God will help me to find the true path. He's right, but I've also been looking for sources to look at that don't come from him or other True Orthodox people I've met.

"Everyone have a blessed Nativity of the Holy Glorious Prophet, Forerunner, and Baptist, John! From those of us in the Old Calendar!",Charis_Humin,1594133961," Today those of us using the Old Calendar celebrate the Nativity of the Holy Glorious Prophet, Forerunner, and Baptist, John! This is the day when Elizabeth, the cousin of the Theotokos, gave birth to St. John the Baptist, six months before the Nativity of our own Lord.

While the Nativity of St. John the Baptist is not one of the 12 Great Feasts, it is still counted as a great feast in the liturgical tradition of the Church.

Troparion: Prophet and Forerunner of the coming of Christ, / although we cannot praise you worthily, / we honor you in love at your nativity, / for by it you ended your father’s silence and your mother’s barrenness, / proclaiming to the world the incarnation of the Son of God!

Kontakion: Today the formerly barren woman gives birth to Christ’s Forerunner, / who is the fulfillment of every prophecy; / for in the Jordan, / when he laid his hand on the One foretold by the prophets, / he was revealed as Prophet, Herald, and Forerunner of God the Word.

The icon for the Nativity of St. John the Baptist is simple. It shows Elizabeth wrapped similar to the Theotokos in the icon of the Nativity of Our Lord. St. John is wrapped up in swaddling clothes, similar to Jesus is in the icon of the Nativity of Our Lord, and the midwife is standing above a jar of water, this parallels the midwives in the icon of the Nativity of our Lord, these parallels are because St. John's ministry was to lead the way for the coming of Our Lord, and point the way to him. And so, in the icon of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, it mirrors the icon of the Nativity of Our Lord to show that St. John points to Our Lord.

This is the meaning  of the Troparion when it says, ""we honor you in love at your nativity, / for by it you ended your father’s silence and your mother’s barrenness, / proclaiming to the world the incarnation of the Son of God!"" Because even in his Nativity, he pointed the way to Our Lord.

The only difference in the icon is Zechariah who is writing the name of the child to be John, in accordance with the word spoken by the angel, and the red streamer above which means that this event takes place inside.",OrthodoxChristianity

The incredible story of Paisios and two Yogis,georglukacs,1594126058,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVpCs4EyByc



This is the story as best I can relate it: Two Greek men who had travelled to India and learned the techniques of eastern mysticism, including special powers over nature, ventured to Mount Athos to show off their skills to the monks there. They found their way to St. Paisios, and when there George, one of the yogis--not the man relating the tale--told Paisios that he could move a rock in front of them. He began reciting his mantras and spells but did not succeed. In order to give them a lesson, Paisios said a prayer in the name of the father son and holy spirit and the rock exploded into pieces with a loud noise which monks further away heard and inquired about. The man relating the tale speaks of how in that moment his whole past came crashing down. The yogis were escorted to a church in order to pray. They tried to get George to pray and kiss the icon of the Virgin but a mighty force would not allow him near the icon, try as the monks did to carry him, evening by pudhing him. The sounds of demons came out of him. They decided to say prayers over him outside the monastery and removed all their holy relics for this purpose. As they did, unearthly voices coming out of his mouth, he ripped off his clothes and ran into the forest crying that he was burning up. The monastery decided nothing could be done immediately for him, and his friend, with much difficulty, got him back to Athens. After that George took his own life. His friend, relating the tale, kept in touch with the holy monks and was saved only by the prayers of Elder Porphyrios and Paisios, and the intervention of Archangel Michael who banished the demons from within him.",OrthodoxChristianity

Can heretics be forgiven? Have I been a heretic?,wweeww2121,1594069687,"So, a bit of time ago I asked the question wether I committed the unforgivable sin on this sub. You guys have been incredibly helpful and have helped me a lot.  I’m Orthodox but was never really all that informed about Christianity in general. So I’ve searched wether all sins can be forgiven, and I’ve talked about how I used this idea to sin at times, like being lazy, porn(big issue with me) and other stuff. 

I came to the realisation that’s not how I should act, I’ve learned that I should actively try repent. I’ve been feeling a lot better lately, I thank you guys for helping me out. I got to a stage where I would say I was in sinning quite a lot, as if I wasn’t scared of God or something, not sure how to phrase it. Thankfully I came back to my senses, my prayers are a lot more sincere and I feel a lot better to have learnt the truth, I feel at peace. Ive managed to drop porn but my laziness is still hanging about but I’m managing to reduce it a fair bit. It’s a journey I guess. Now the things I’ve read online gave me the wrong idea and I don’t know wether I was really following the Orthodox teachings then. I’ve learnt the truth, and I do feel better. Despairing wasn’t the solution, as it would make me fall deeper in sin, gave me anxiety and depression, started having bad vision, not great. And yet, I still feel hopeful, I’m trying to repent and I feel like I’m not lost yet, but I do need to keep working. I’ve been getting better. Do you guys think I was a heretic? Could I be forgiven now that I know the truth? A lot of times I’ve always thought about searching more but I would end up forgetting about it as soon as I started doing other stuff. And the times I’ve searched I wouldn’t really learn anything new ( didn’t really know what to search). 

Thankfully my dad helped me out as I talked to him, he made me understand I need to read about the Orthodox teachings, not just some other teachings ( again, I wasn’t really knowledgeable about Christianity). Thank you for any help, it’s very much appreciated. You guys helped me a lot when I felt down, and I understood that I need to repent, and staying in despair would only get me to sin more and more.

What are the current challenges faced by the Orthodox Church with regards to liberalism/modern culture)?,curious_lutheran,1594060790,"Hi all,

I'm a Lutheran who's always had a deep respect for Orthodoxy. I visited Orthodox churches on occasion growing up, and having always enjoyed talking with you guys and learning about your history and theology. :)

Obviously in the 20th century there has been a lot of liberalism that has worked its way into Christianity. I'm very familiar with Vatican II and all the effects, for better or worse, it has had on the Roman Catholic Church. Lutherans as well have battled -- and are still battling -- the influences of modern culture.

Elder Ephraim of Arizona: There is no sin capable of overpowering God’s compassion.,The_Woke_WhiteBoy,1594057274,"&gt;God forgives with great ease!—as long as man opens up and returns to Him with sincere repentance. God does not want reimbursement or payment from man in exchange for His eternal gifts. No! Even if man has millions or billions of sins, for God they are nothing. What is a handful of sand in the midst of the ocean? All the sins of humanity are nothing but a speck in the ocean. There is no sin capable of overpowering God’s compassion. Since we have such infinite compassion waiting for us, why should we continuously drag our heels? We should run and jump into His embrace in order to be forgiven. The devil tries to pull us backward, while God and our guardian angel urge us onward. We will go to whomever we obey. This is what the Holy Gospel and the holy Fathers teach us. Let us not brush them aside; let us not remain indifferent; let us not drown in life’s concerns. Christ’s words are crystal clear: “Only one thing is needed.” Let us set aside earthly cares, and let us focus on cultivating our soul in order to render it fruitful in the eyes of God. Death will come; it will catch up to us. Whether we want to or not, we will arrive at its black gate and cross over to the other side. There is no other road; no other path. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have the full text if anyone wants it. But in particular this quotation is making me consider leaving Protestantism. But I digress. The important point of all of this is that we must prepare ourselves for death; the reaper is gaining on each and everyone of us; *in what state will death find me? Grubbing for more loot? Or pursuing the highest ends I am able to purse?*

Statement by Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill in connection with the situation regarding Hagia Sophia,radonezh,1594057254,"**His Holiness Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill made a statement on the status of the Hagia Sophia.**

&gt;I am deeply concerned over the calls of certain Turkish politicians to reconsider the museum status of Hagia Sophia, one of the greatest monuments of Christian culture.

&gt;Built in the 6th century in honour of Christ the Saviour, this church is of great importance to the whole Orthodoxy. And it is especially dear to the Russian Church. Prince Vladimir’s envoys stepped across the threshold of this church and were captivated by its heavenly beauty. Having heard their story, St. Vladimir received baptism and baptised Rus’, which followed him into a new spiritual and historical dimension – Christian civilisation.

&gt;Many generations conveyed to us admiration for achievements of this civilisation, with us now being its part. And Hagia Sophia has always been one of its devoutly venerated symbols. The image of this church has become deeply ingrained in our culture and history, having given strength and inspiration to our architects of the past in Kiev, Novgorod, Polotsk – in all the major centres of the spiritual formation of Early Rus’..

&gt;**There were different, sometimes rather difficult periods in the history of relations between Rus’ and Constantinople.. Yet, with bitterness and indignation the Russian people responded in the past and respond now to any attempt to degrade or trample upon the millennium-old spiritual heritage of the Church of Constantinople. A threat to Hagia Sophia is a threat to the entire Christian civilisation and, therefore, to our spirituality and history. To this day Hagia Sophia remains a great Christian shrine for every Russian Orthodox believer.**

&gt;It is a duty of every civilised state to maintain balance: to reconcile the society, and not aggravate discords in it; to help unite people, and not divide them.

&gt;Today the relationships between Turkey and Russia are developing dynamically. At the same time, one should take into account that Russia is a country with the majority of population professing Orthodoxy, and so, what may happen to Hagia Sophia will inflict great pain on the Russian people.

&gt;I hope for the prudence of Turkey’s state leadership. Preservation of the current neutral status of Hagia Sophia, one of the greatest masterpieces of Christian culture and a church–symbol for millions of Christians all over the world, will facilitate further development of the relations between the peoples of Russia and Turkey and help strengthen interfaith peace and accord.

Honest question(s) from a male-to-female transsexual,thewrexywrexer,1593993756,"(forgive me if this is quite rambly, I'm normally just a lurker on reddit. I hope you can understand what I'm trying to explain at least.)

Hiya. For some quick context, I was baptised as a Greek Orthodox when I was a toddler but I never took Christianity seriously until very recently. I'm also a mtf transsexual, I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when I was a teenager and I always felt really uncomfortable about my birth sex but for what ever reason God decided I was going to born a male with this medical disorder instead of being born female.

I had been in a dark place for a long time but I found the light, finally opened my heart for Christ and I'm interested in the Orthodox Church. I'm open enough to admit treating transexualism through transitioning and surgery is a sin in some respect, but why would God give me gender dysphoria? If it's just to test me it seems pointlessly cruel. I know he has his reasons for doing so, but I just don't understand why would he expect me to reject something that's bought genuine happiness and wellbeing to my life despite other problems that persist. If I stopped transitioning tomorrow and went back to being a man it'd be one big lie I'd telling myself and just utter misery. Not like it's something I can't have because I'm told I'm not allowed it but something dearly missing, like Christ in my life until recently.

I'm not one of those new-age gender people who believe there's 76 genders, I accept the fact my birth sex will always be male but seeing there's no other way to treat dysphoria I want to full pursue my transition and hopefully one day be comfortable enough to call myself a traditional woman of God. I won't lie either, I want to stay celibate until I have the surgery and find the right man I want to marry. But it's all conflicting I do admit, I know I don't want to spend the rest of my life unhappy but also I know what makes me feel peace probably isn't what God intended.

So the final question is, would God understand where I'm coming from and still love me for who I am despite the sin? I suppose for any other concern I would ask the opinions of the church directly but it's so personal and conflicting that only God truly knows.",OrthodoxChristianity

Choosing between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy,Mexicanmerc,1593931476," 

Hello, r/catholicism and r/orthodoxchristianity. I am posting this on both forums as I need help figuring out which of the two churches to follow. Its been a great burden on my chest for years now and I need help figuring out what to do. 

To give some backstory: My parents never baptized me as an infant, and so I had to choose which denomination to follow. I eventually narrowed it down to three: 1) Roman Catholicism 2) Eastern Orthodoxy 3) Sedevacantism. Protestantism wasn't appealing as it was created so long after the creation of the church. I was frustrated for many months and drifted in and out of Christianity for a variety of reasons. But one of the top reasons was the exhaustion of choosing one of the three. To make a long story short, I eventually chose Vatican ii Catholicism and was baptized a little more than a year ago. However, those doubts and worries never really left and have plagued me since. 

Sedevacantism has, for the most part, left my system. But that still leaves two contenders that both have very strong arguments for being the true church. I will list below the things that make me both believe and doubt both churches. 

Catholicism Cons and Orthodox Pros:

* Vatican ii has sat very poorly with me. I don't know if it's just the sedevacantist influences or the fact that I am more of a traditionalist in most aspects of my life, but I've felt that the church would have been a lot better without that council. 
* At the time of the schism, 1 patriarch and 4 patriarchs split from one another. It's not all a numbers game, but the difference does stand out. 
* Pope Francis has been very liberal in comparison to our past popes. I find some of his actions and words to be very un-catholic.  This reminds me of John Paul ii when he kissed the Koran.  The orthodox patriarchs, on the other hand, have been very good at keeping with tradition. 
* The Filioque being added post-council takes away from its legitimacy in my honest opinion. Do know that I'm not denying nor affirming the Filioque. 
* The fact that the divine liturgy has remained practically unchanged is very attractive. The Novus Ordo Mass took away many aspects that would have been attractive for a traditionalist like me. 

Catholicism Pros and Orthodox Cons: 

* Mathiew 16:18-19 (""And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.  I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”) This line has stuck with me and was one of the main reasons that I chose Catholicism. I know Peter first when to Antioch, but in my reasoning, Rome was the more important of the two. 
* The catholic church is the largest charitable organization in the world.
* There is a very strict hierarchy with the pope at the top. There is a final say and disputes are resolved relatively quickly. The split between the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Patriarch of Russia is rather unattractive, as there is no clear cut higher authority to resolve the dispute. 
* This is a sedevacantist video that talks about the importance of saint peter. I do want to preface again that I am not a sedevacantist, but rather that this video was strong in me choosing Catholicism as a whole. A good portion of this channel does not sit well with me. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KV6PXSODgE&amp;t=155s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KV6PXSODgE&amp;t=155s)
* The fact that the Orthodox haven't had an ecumenical council in so long doesn't feel right and adds onto a fear of the church being divided internally. In a sense, I guess I feel that Vatican ii may have been a step in the wrong direction, but I still want to see steps being taken, if that makes any sense. 
* I can't find it rn, but there was a letter from one of the eastern patriarchs asking the pope to preside over a council. It stated something along the lines of ""I ask you to come as a son does for his father"", or something along those lines. 

There may be more things for me to add to both of these lists, but I'll leave it at this for now. I know it's an inconvenience, but any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you and God Bless!",OrthodoxChristianity

Advise,Light_Cosmos1,1593873378,"TL,DR: 

Hey! I'm from non-Christian background, who'd deep interest to find the meaning and have been searching for truth since many years. I've been through a lot of denominations(hopping hereto and thereto) which prompted me to check early church fathers and as I studied, it became quite complex as 'Logos Christology' wasn't exactly as I thought 'Nicene Trinitarian' christology would be but as Capadoucian fathers would say, it all depends how God reveals to Church and as it progresses thus to believe in Trinity, it is necessary to affirm authority of OC. 
   The problem lies here, I've quite an issue with Iconography, and also 'Logos as one in essence with the Father' with equal glory. As I study more, It really becomes so complex, I find myself to give up altogether my quest for truth. I suffer from loneliness, and anxiety so, it always been a greatest struggle to find truth as I've been from a very fundamentalist family who are quite strict adherent to their beliefs, and have to hide mine. 
  But in the end, in all of my existential crisis or evermore so my faith crisis, as much I come closer to the OC, I experience a strange feeling of abundant peace and relief. As If I'm babe and being comforted. As If everything seems so simplistic and I can just lay down and rely. Even in my recent dream(when everything seems to be collapsing as a 'apocalyptic type of dream' I found myself in a lil EO house parish(which happens to recently convert from  protestant to Orthodoxy): In which they were two men and 4 children to be found singing Nativity hymns though in very child-like manner, and indeed were so happy, and rejoicing. I felt secluded[perhaps may be I dunno due to be constant reasoning(or doubt/search) or maybe depressed cause due to my family]...but in that very moment 'something' of the Spirit of Christ touched me, cleansed me flowing from the atmosphere as if Christ was being born in the big womb amidst of Byzantine cross.)
   I'd this experience of warmth and calmness often times in relation with EO stuff. Still, i don't understand, my mind isn't convinced, I struggle, I feel meaningless, I fear my own family If I go against them. I fear–what if I'm wrong? I can't trust my intellect for truth, because it can err so my interpretation of History which suffers with ambiguities and biases. I always dread the death, I desire peace and happiness. I always desired truth. Please help me. It may perhaps seems nonsensical rambling but help me. Hope you'll understand.

How to stop engaging in debates?,happysunshinegoals1,1593868796,"I have engaged in debates about Orthodoxy for about 2 years now, I’m in high school so I don’t really know as much as I should to actually do that and I’m engaging with other high schoolers which means none of us our probably mature enough for it.

A couple months ago I realized I shouldn’t be debating like this because I’m disrespecting Kevin’s religion but Kevin is either looking into the faith or trying to provoke me.

I *want* them to get what they deserve, *every bit* of it. I *know* this is wrong, but I do not know how to turn it off.

A couple of years ago, I heard the story of how the Romanov family was killed in the Bolshevik revolution, specifically how their little daughters were executed, and it filled me with terrible grief for lives taken away so young, and then *rage* toward the individuals who do these things to *human beings*, let alone human beings who are that *helpless.* Even though that happened a hundred years ago, and the people who committed those atrocities are all long dead.

I know that God takes no pleasure in the death of sinners, and rather delights in those who turn away from sin, but when I see or hear of people doing that to their children or other people's children, or beating them, or torturing them, or bullying them, it makes me so angry that I want to kill them with my bare hands, and be the one that pulls the lever to dump them into the lowest pit of hell.

"""Involuntary sin""",kipling_sapling,1593804138,"Hey folks,

I (a lifelong Protestant) was visiting some EO friends recently and the conversation turned to the concept of sin. They described how sin is viewed more broadly in your tradition than in ours, that sin and guilt aren't as joined at the hip as in Protestantism, and that it can be voluntary or involuntary. They used miscarriages to illustrate the concept of involuntary sin and said there are plenty of other examples. I'm curious to know more. Specifically, I'd like to know if succumbing to illness would be a form of involuntary sin. Perhaps it depends. Would an autoimmune disease or cancer be classified differently than, say, the flu?

Inquiring with questions,histtohrev,1593803197,"Hello All. 

I have 2 very unrelated questions. I am a cradle Catholic, and I have been having looking into Orthodoxy. 

1-there is a Russian Orthodox Church not much further than the church we go to now, but the idea of the national churches really bothers me. I know it’s an administrative thing, but didn’t the Greek and Russian orthodox churches excommunicate each other over Ukraine? I guess if I say...went to the Russian Orthodox, would I still be in the same church with the Greek or Romanian or Bulgarian Orthodox churches? Maybe it’s just because I have been raised Catholic but it feels like the national churches hurt the spread of the church in a way. Plus, it seems the me as in outsider that the orthodox churches can sometimes be overly connected to the government (I removed seeing something about a Putin icon that ended up getting scrapped for the new church in Moscow). Plus with Ukraine also it seems the the church is operating as an arm of the state by wanting administrative control. This just doesn’t seem like something the church should be doing. But again, I am an outsider so if I am getting something wrong let me know. 

2- the lack of councils. To me it seems like orthodoxy just stopped developing after the great schism. Maybe this is just the catholic in me. Can anybody disprove that?


3-in Catholicism we have our mortal sins and purgatory. If you are nearing death and you know you haven’t committed any mortal sins, you can basically know that you will spend some time in purgatory and then it’s strait to heaven. But with orthodoxy not having any of those things it seems like your end destination seems a bit more in question at any one time. Plus, to me at least, you can just say well even though Orthodoxy doesn’t have mortal sins it’s basically the same thing ie mortal sins=serious sins become I don’t know that they do. I know that is what the church teaches but mortal sin and ending up in hell is a binary thing-you have a unconfessed mortal sin = hell. It just seems like orthodoxy would leave the final judgement a bit more murky. 

I want to say I am an outsider and I do not mean any disrespect or anything with any questions. Just curious. And again it’s completely possible I have something wrong here and if so it was an honest mistake.",OrthodoxChristianity

The single biggest stumbling block for me choosing Orthodoxy over Catholicism.,athumbhat,1593733536,"Excluding the issues that the Orthodox and Catholic church disagree on, there was and never has been a Bishop of Rome that taught heresy, or there has been only one(Honorious). This contrasts with the multitude of nestrian (including nestorius), monophysite, iconoclast and so on heretics of the other patriarchates (though, admittedly I do not know much about the record of the patriarch of Jerusalem). Why is it that this one bishopric was able to stay so incredibly free from heresy (in both relative terms and absolute terms) when the others so often held heretics? 

I am aware of pope honorius, but there is a somewhat convincing argument to be made that he never purposefully taught heresy, and if it is taught that the pope c as not teach heresy, then I may be were willing to accept the argument, seeing as there is only one pope of spurious orthodoxy whereas there are a multitude of patriarchs of the other sees who are absolutely heretics. Why is rome so comparatively unsullied? Not slightly less, but incredibly less?

Again, from the perspective of someone choosing between Orthodoxy and Catholicism, the heresies that are considered to be such only by the Orthodox can be explained in that they are not heresies  Catholicism is accepted. But nobody denies that until the schism, or the time leading up to it, the see of rome had at most one bishop of spurious Orthodoxy, in comparison to the multitude of heretics in the history of the other patriarchates.

This is, to me, Romes most convincing argument, it is not of course an absolute proof, just as any see can go 50 years without being sullied by heresy, so can one go 1000 years without it neccesarily meaning anything, but given the stark numerical difference, it seems there must be *some* explanation other than extreme luck, whether it be divine providence or something else.",OrthodoxChristianity
When should I tell my family?,gatorbaby22,1593732908,"Hi friends,

I am on the way to becoming serious about joining the Orthodox church; after months of researching, praying, and speaking to other Orthodox Christians, I feel that I am being called to it. I've gotten some great advice from people in this sub, so thank you for that first of all.

Background: my father is a Protestant missionary, and my parents are both strong Christians with relationships with God that inspire me greatly, and I respect them a ton. I am the oldest child, and we have a good relationship; they seem to respect me as well. However, they both view Catholicism and Orthodoxy pretty negatively, and don't even really consider them Christian. Neither of them have much exposure to Orthodoxy, and they have some weird views on it (magic?). As an example, I very gently mentioned the Church in a conversation the other day and my mom said ""imagine how sad it is to not have a relationship with God."" Obviously I don't share their point of view.

Their response, however, is not the main problem. I could definitely debate with them and try to answer the questions they have about it, and plan to do so. Here's the issue: a week ago, one of my sisters hit us with a massive bombshell: she renounced her faith, came out as gay, and told us she had started a relationship with a woman. My parents were grieved, and continue to treat her well and love her, but the fact that she has drifted away from God is hurting them immensely. I will often walk into a room where they were alone and see them wipe tears away. I was planning on telling them pretty soon before this happened

So my question is this: when should I tell them that I have begun the journey? Should I wait until I have become a catechumen, or even to the point where I am to be baptized? Should I leave some time open and keep this a secret from my family until their wound heals a little? My sister's situation has obviously inflicted a massive wound on them, and I am so worried that I will hurt them even more if, in their eyes, I am ""drifting away"" as well. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you all.",OrthodoxChristianity

Opinions regarding Catechumenate + picking a name.,LandofLemons,1593698869,"What up folks.

So I've been avoiding this post, because of concern that it would make my researching of other religions too biased.

Anyway, I've come to the conclusion that I can't avoid how much I need to become Orthodox :/
I was super afraid of making a rash decision, but I was doing 5-8 hours of research per day for a couple of months on Orthodoxy and different expressions of Christianity + religion generally. I don't so that amount anymore, I have a much better balance. 

I started virtually meeting twice a week with a priest about a month and a half ago. And started attending the Lenten services from the first Sunday of Great Lent until lockdown regulations started.

I fully plan on continuing my research of other religions out of interest, and seeking to understand. But, I am continuously made to feel secure and certain in choosing to become Orthodox. There are things I don't like, things I feel are worthy of criticism, but I have never felt so at peace or jovial in prayer and perspective as now. Praying the brief morning and evening prayers + the jesus prayer, has taken so much pressure off, and made prayer so much more about connecting with God. I'm not longer terrified of being wrong and going to hell because of it. Having salvation be the relationship with God is amazing.

I started doing Catechism classes with another parish virtually, their process is different (you attend classes + inquire for 6 months and then get baptised, without the period of being a formal catechumen). While the parish I attended at you have a formal period of catechumenate. Anyway the priest and I have discussed a couple of times, and he's entirely comfortable to receive me as a catechumen as soon as I am. And I have been for a while, but still wanted to tread carefully so as not to make a rash decision.

But in attending catechism classes basically 3 times a week, doing RCIA, and baha'i lessons, and general research. I know I want to be Orthodox. It has repaired my relationship with God, and brought immense peace and joy into my experience of religion (which had been gone for quite some time, I had felt anxiety and apathy around my own experience of religion. But loved general research, if that makes sense?)

So I basically need to ask someone to be my sponsor (the priest has suggested someone) and pick a name. 

How would you recommend going about picking a name? 

I've decided I'm comfortable with the priest I'm currently meeting with most, from the parish I visited during lent. He's a lot more Conservative than the other priest (who is lovely and gave me a ton of reading material!), and I tend not to agree with all of his views but I admire his sincerity and how we are able to have dialogue about theologoumena and such. But if you believe some other factors should be taken into account regarding a spiritual father, let me know! 

Also, I'm more comfortable having a formal period of catechumenate rather than just getting baptised as soon as I'm done with the classes/6 months of inquiry. It feels like less pressure, and as if I'd be way more able to make a truly prayerful choice. I would be done around July/August if I take the other parish's route, but this way, it feels like it's not as rushed. If that makes sense? 

Any other advice? Or just general factors you think I should take into account? 

If any of you think I am making a rash decision, please let me know so I can reflect some more! 

Much thanks for your time :)",OrthodoxChristianity
Sharing temple spaces with Catholics without celebrating liturgy together,hipsterbeard12,1593695030,"I have seen a few Orthodox missions use Catholic churches before they are able to build their own temple.  I cannot recall ever seeing a Catholic mission being hosted by an Orthodox church.   I know there are reasons why Orthodox and Catholics are not supposed to concelebrate liturgies, but I don't know if this is prohibited both ways, whether Orthodox can use Catholic space but not allow Catholics to use Orthodox space, or whether there is no prohibition either way.  I know some important churches like the Holy Sepulchre are shared, but I'm not sure if that is just a unique situation.

I feel as though Orthodoxy needs to address the issue of lust as it pertains to women.,Oil_Paint_Girl,1593652079,"By which I mean, address the ways that women struggle with lust. When I have attempted to find resources on how to experience healthy attraction and know when to refrain from lustful thoughts, the writings are geared towards men and seem very masculine. (The assumption is that I am a man struggling with viewing pornography or something).

Women tend to experience a linked desire for sex and emotional intimacy at the same time, so how we avoid lustful thoughts and behavior may need different advice. What I mean is, finding ways to seek emotional and romantic warmth that does not involve sexual thoughts or actions. How to explain to women what the issue is with fantasizing about sex with a future spouse, because that feels more wholesome and emotional than viewing porn.

I guess what I'm saying is that Orthodox women need more resources for dealing with sexual desire, because at the moment the resources out there are geared towards men and male experiences of sexuality.",OrthodoxChristianity

Feedback wanted for Bible Edition in Progress,Cloud_of_Witnesses,1593634096,"Please forgive the title - I know there are a lot of posts from people asking for recommendations for Bible editions, but this isn’t one of those. I listened to a talk by Priestmonk Kosmas a while back in which he emphasized the importance of reading the Bible and the lives of Saints above all else. He talked about how too many people are wanting to dive into works that they aren’t spiritually prepared for (I think he gave an example about inquirers reading the Philokalia). The longer I chewed on it, the more I thought about how I’d like a Bible that had hagiographical material, patristic commentary, liturgical texts, and commentary from modern Orthodox voices.

I’ve been told that if there’s a thing you want and it doesn’t exist, you might just be the person who can make it exist. There a dozens of Bible editions that try to squeeze comments about every single verse, but I’m a proponent of quality &gt; quantity. I’ve created a few pages showing what I’m thinking of, and I’d appreciate any feedback. Some of the things I’d like feedback on:

-Aesthetics (I purposefully varied a few pages to see what might be better)
-Amount of hagiographical material/commentary (should there be more or less - I can always tinker with font sizes and arrangements to make it happen)
-Recommendations on commentary or Saints that I should have included but overlooked

A Catholic who has questions on the Divine Liturgy,stmichaelp4us,1593631017,"Hi Reddit Orthodox,

I am a Catholic and questions for those who can offer insight.  It is believed among Catholics that Orthodox Churches have the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.  As my love and reverence has grown for this sacrament, I find myself continually perplexed in Catholic liturgies that the eucharist is distriubted by lay people.  These lay people touch the sacred vessels and stand next to the priest and distribute the sacrament.

What happens in the orthodox churches?  Would this be a reprimand?  excommunication? is this allowed? how do you view such actions...favorably or disfavorably?  The more information the better.

What the Catholic Church officially teaches in the 21st century,pathei-mathos,1593621111,"I prepared this as a comment in response to a post that was deleted before I could hit submit. However, I think it might still be of interest to people here.

The OP had wondered in one of his/her comments whether and why the Catholic church opposes cruelty to animals. I can't vouch for its accuracy, but the Humane Society has posted a PDF file about what they call ""Pope Francis’s unreserved embrace of animal a protection. \[Have a look at it and see what you think\]([http://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/archive/assets/pdfs/national-volunteer-center/Additional-Documents/faith-outreach-pope.pdf](http://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/archive/assets/pdfs/national-volunteer-center/Additional-Documents/faith-outreach-pope.pdf)). That document cites the Catechism of the Catholic church, which is the official catechism for the Catholic church as a whole. There are also local catechisms that are published by national conferences of bishops, etc.

A slightly out of date English version of the Catechism of the Catholic Church (including footnotes showing the basis for their teachings) can be found \[here on the Vatican's website\]([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc/index.htm](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc/index.htm)). This catechism was initially prepared for Pope John Paul II under the direction of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI. It was the first new catechism for the Catholic church as a whole in 400 years, so it was a pretty big achievement and it's an excellent reference for what Rome officially teaches in the 21st century.

Animal exploitation for entertainment and other very unnecessary reasons,Theleavesfloat,1593618427,"I understand some Christians believe that animals were put on this earth for humans to use and exploit, which I disagree with, I think that belief stems from feeling too much pride and feeling too special, it also conflicts with God being compassionate and loving, a God like that wouldn't create sentient beings that are as intelligent as little human children just to be exploited, I haven't read the entire old testament, I have little knowledge, I don't know where exactly that belief came from, now for me personally I don't see myself above animals, I mean yes I am made in the image of God, in the sense that I go beyond extinct and have a moral agency too, animals tho are like little children, innocent and helpless, in my eyes we humans have responsibility to care for them rather than take advantage of their vulnerability and helplessness and exploit them, that just is more in line with compassion, and God is the source of all love and compassion.


Jesus came to preach the gospel and die for us, that was his purpose, he didn't even come to abolish slavery, the bible is ok with slavery, it doesn't speak against it, times change and we have brains that we should use, we can see that slavery is wrong regardless whether it's permitted in Christianity, we oppose slavery not because we are directly told to do so through the bible but because it's the reasonable and compassionate thing to do.


Now to me i care about animals a lot, sure they are only as smart as little children (some smarter than others for sure) but they are very similar to us, they suffer and feel like us, if you have a dog you'll know what I'm talking about, and science has proved their sentience as well in case we are skeptical. 

Some say suffering isn't bad, in some cases yes it isn't bad, because suffering can be beneficial to us mortal sinful humans, suffering within itself is bad tho, imagine this, would you want to be free from suffering and live happily? Of course you do, suffering is good for humans because it can help you reach that goal, and for animals suffering doesn't help them in anyway, its only bad, all this cruelty we cause to animals doesn't help us or make the world a better more compassionate place.


I'm told to love my fellow humans and help them, but I extend that to animals too because to me it's only reasonable, because as I explained they're sentient too, if I was an animal instead of a human I would want to be happy and free from suffering, we can empathize with animals too, nothing wrong with that.

About human in Orthodox Christianity,novsof02,1593591884,"The post about “conservative” clothes for women made me remind myself the story. I remember, it was in my school from that I was just graduated in this year.

It was common school-day but Social studies teacher was replaced. Another teacher came and started to tell us about human’s position in this world.
“You know, there are 3 positions how a person can see himself,” the professor told. “You all here have parents. And some of you can listen to them only because of fear. Such people are poor people. They cannot find themselves in their life. I won’t ever believe that a person who, for example, broke a mirror in bathroom is a happy person and did it because of love”.

He wrote fear on the board then painted a sign of dollar and a heart. “Do you know why countries where the most population are Protestants are so rich? They consider their wealth as an award from God. If a person where launched any business and his business becomes successful the person thinks that he’s doing everything right and was gifted by Lord. Such people in our life listen to parents just in exchange for something. They can seem happy. At least non of them won’t ever break a mirror in the bathroom”.

He smiled and asked, “Do you guess, what’s the third position? Love, of course. The happiest people in the world can do everything because of love to their parents and God. And they receive love as well”

Most of my classmates are atheists and they started to giggle. But the teacher continued “I tell you the story about something what happened here, in this building about century. It is a legend but pretty good legend.

You know here was a gymnasium for orphan girls. All these girls were approximately the same age as yours. And most of them who studied here before revolution had the same attitude as yours but were killed by people who did everything only because of fear.
But this story is about a girl who studied here before revolution. It was a celebration so girls were wearing solemn dresses. That girl while writing has got a blur of her dress.

She was upset of course. The tutors and other children started to insult and offend her because of the blur. One of the teachers told the girl that she is a blur herself.

Of course, the student started to hide from everyone. And then she saw, according to the legend, Mary mother of Jesus. Mother of God told the girl that she is not the blur. That’s how the legend finishes. You may not believe in it but it shows when a man to whom only love can help with life is in trouble he is never alone”.

I didn’t know what to say but I remember this lesson. I remember how my classmates giggled too. Anyway I am still thinking about this legend. There is no evidence to tell you if it is true or not but I am thoughtful what everyone of us is not “blur”. Everyone of us is not something we hear about ourselves.",OrthodoxChristianity

It is commonly used to demonstrate some form of Roman supremacy in the Early Church, so I'm curious how you would read it. This is an excerpt from his letter to pope Damasus.

Whoever eats the Lamb outside this house is profane. Anyone who is not in the ark of Noah will perish when the flood prevails.""*

There's a few ideas in this quote as far as I can tell. First, he considers Rome to be the Petrine see. In his letter he says ""the chair of Peter"" in relation to the pope, meaning that there is one Petrine chair and the Roman patriarch presides over it. Second, the Roman see is the rock on which the Church has been built, not Peter's confession or Christ alone, although it is those as well, but the chair of Peter. Third, and this is very interesting, those that eat the paschal lamb, that is the Eucharist, outside of the Roman Church are profane. This would imply that whenever there is a schism between Christians, it is those on the side of the Roman Church are in the correct Church and those outside are ""profane."" Fourth, he implies that those outside of communion with this Church will ""perish when the flood prevails."" This doesn't need much explanation.

Advice moving forward,kkslyder,1593564390,"Hey there everyone. Been a while since I posted. But I guess I'll get right to the point, and I'll give you a background in everything. Cause it's quite of a lot... So I'm a 26/m.  Been bouncing from job to job. With a degree and sort of been out of the Workforce for about a year now. Been looking for work of course, anything that I can see and grow with a company. Didn't know what but I'll explain in a bit. Of course no would have liked to stock with my career field, but haven't found a thing. My GF has been recommended grad school but can't handle the pressure of the school work and the debt. And grad school still isn't a garuntee for a job. So I do t want to put myself through all that and come to realize it's not what I want to do anymore. I know people say that I'm you g and I still have time. But to be honest I want to start on my future now rather than say in 2 years having paid a crazy amount on school and still don't know if I'd have a job at the end. Ok so about a week ago during this whole pandemic I got a job. Nothing fancy. Customer service gig. Cool environment. Work from home until the office opens up. 45k starting salary. Better than nothing. Health, dental, vision,  retirement. All that stuff. Sounds good right.. wrong. Back up a few weeks ago when I had the worst anxiety of my life. Thinking everything was over. Grandfather passed from the virus. Best friends broke up with each other, constat arguing at my home, had to turn down a job cause it payed minimum wage and I was afraid I'd bring the virus home working at the location. As a health aide. dropped out of my attempt to go back to school for EMS. Literally felt like the world was crashing and I thought my girlfriend would leave me cause she would see no future with me. Probably the lowest point of my life I've ever felt.  So yeah anxiety through the roof. Been in a relationship with someone I truely love for almost 7 months. Im talking about someone I can spend the rest of my life with. Someone that never annoys me. Someone that I can wake up to and go to bed at night feeling happy with. Someone I know that can be the one. She is someone who when we started dating I had nothing to offer. Like literally nothing. Had to be weary about going on dates with her cause for 2 things: 1) I didn't want her spending a dime for me, and 2) cause I barely had anything and whatever I had I spent for her. Oh and she's not the type that expects everything to be paid for. Which is another reason why I love her so much. And I can go on and on. But then I'll be writing a book. 
    
    Job is stressful cause of course starting a new job with no background in that field or experience it's a lot of info to take in in a short amount of time and me being the person I am, I tend to pressure myself to perfect everything in a short amount of time. So this on top of my other stress has been eating at me. Oh yeah and the fact that I inherited a quite a good amount from my grandfather. Which I feel sort of guilty for having, but consider it a gift and a blessing. So now I'm in a position where I have a lot of good things going for me but don't know how to move forward with telling my GF about the inheritence cause I'm afraid of where it might lead. I feel like this story is all over the place. And I hope it makes some sort of sense. 

Long story short. I went from having nothing to feeling lost, depressed, anxiety, stressed but having someone in my life whom has cared for me in so many ways. And I know she is looking out for her future as well and I want to be a part of it to help support her through everything, and she says she wants the best for me too. Of course I still don't know what I want for myself. Career wise, but I'm hoping what I have now would work long term. And I don't know what to tell her with the inheritence. Cause she might tell me to use it to go back to school but afraid if I say no cause that's not a route I want to take, I'm afraid she might leave me cause she won't see a future with someone who does customer service. 

I seriously hope this makes sense. If not I'll explain more from what you ask.",OrthodoxChristianity

Corporate Humanity and God's Image,TheLogosBecameFlesh,1593561628,"God and the creation.  Christ and the Church.  Adam and Eve/offspring.  Husband and wife/children.

Why does God treat humanity corporately?  Why are we born in a state of separation from God?  Obviously we are not guilty of Adam's sin.  On the flip side, why is there a Body of Christ that corporately receives oneness with Christ? 

My response is that I think, ontologically, God decided to work things in this manner because it represents the relationship between the creation and its Creator.  The creation is nothing without its Creator.  She depends on God at all moments to be sustained in being.  The Creator is everything in Himself and the creation is nothing in herself.  

Humanity is an image of God.  From God, you have the origin of all contingent things.  In the order of creation, Adam represents the origin of humanity.  He represents God.\*  Eve and their offspring represent the creation.  Adam's sin affects all of his creation (Eve / offspring) and separates it from God.  Since Adam is the corporate head of humanity as its origin, his actions affect his creation since it, in a secondary sense, belongs to him.  We are linked to Adam and Adam became disconnected from God.  Therefore, humanity became separated from God as a whole.

Christ came and fixed this connection.  Adam represents man's origin, but Christ *is* man's origin.  In His humility, He was obedient to God in His humanity even unto death, fulfilling human nature in its nothingness before God.  Therefore, God resurrected and exalted Christ above all, uniting humanity to God through Himself, forming a glorified corporate Body, the Body of Christ.  Anyone who becomes reborn in Him can become part of His corporate Body and brought into intimate union with God.

"Looking, and keeping on looking (advice please)",georgejunglist,1593542193,"I am born into a family of ethnicity nominally orthodox. But I was brought up in a Roman catholic country which is quite secular. I did not attend church school since there weren't any in my vicinity, therefore I have mostly developed a point of view on life that is democratic, somewhat progressive, ecology aware.

I later on became more and more attracted to my old countries religion on a purely aesthetic level, as the mysticism of desolate monasteries appealed to me. I later on visited some of the most beautiful monasteries in my old country and got into it a bit more. 

However, when I started attending the church life when I moved to the capital of the country where I was born, new country, I came to see it is basically a cultural center for a specific ethnicity. It's basically about 'sticking to the roots', gay and Muslim bashing etc.

So i took a slight turn away from it to a more personal approach, reading theological texts etc. I relate to Berdyaev and the likes. I don't think God is an ocd driven particularities guy.

I trust in personal freedom, freedom of expression, sustainability. To get myself back to ground I currently endulge solace in nature. I just believe, pray and don't think about whether it's OK to be gay, commie, whatever... 

I have a couple of questions though. Our form of Christianity is much driven by monasticism, but i like my job. I consider it a calling on this world. I enjoy being a data scientist. I love being a parent. I love hiking and nf and a nice herbal tea in the tent in the mountain. I enjoy living in the moment, which it took a long time to train, so I have a grip on my life like never before. I basically taught myself to think about my family, my job and my soul.

And after all of this, I still consider myself orthodox. Any advice for me, any comfort, anything? I want to be Orthodox, but I am not built the same way my church brethren are, so I really can't find my place there. So basically when I find my place and feel touched while in nature, like in a tent in the middle of the woods in the mountains, i feel overwhelmed and it's like my hand automatically does the hand of the cross, says the Jesus prayer and thanks God in the name of the father, son and holy spirit.

Faith versus works,1001Trees,1593531521,"Hello there. I’m an inquirer not officially a catechumen but I will be made a catechumen when classes start back up at my parish in the fall.

Is this correct? Or, if there’s no one correct framework to view this in, is this an acceptable viewpoint/opinion?



My mom thinks that the orthodox believe we earn our way into heaven. I plan on asking my priest this as well but I wanted to get a multiplicity of perspectives: What is the best way to tell/demonstrate to her that the orthodox do not believe we earn our way into heaven and that, rather, we believe that Jesus did the work in his incarnation/death and resurrection?

Catholic to Occult to hopefully Orthodox,celestiallilies,1593526740,"Hi. I'm new to this community, and any advice, prayers, or guidance would be of great help.

To make a long story as short as I can, I converted to Catholicism awhile back, about 3-4 years ago. I converted because deep down I wanted to know more about God and how to follow Him, and more strikingly, I was dealing with a difficult situation with entities I thought converting to Catholicism and adopting the customs in order to communicate with and come closer to God would rid me of them. Well, it did not, and I have gone through an agonizing time for years. I tried praying the Catholic rosary and I'd spend hours praying it everyday. My situation worsened, though. I felt mocked and betrayed in a way by everything I was reading, taught, and believed.

I got so distraught I ended up dabbling in and then doing more than just ""dabbling in"" the occult. Tarot readings, sigils, etc. I know it seems counter productive and counterintuitive, but I felt as if God just did not love me enough to help me. I would talk to Him despite being in the circumstances I was in, though, looking for a way out. I would receive signs of His care, or what could be interpreted as such(althiugh I'd love to share, they're also personal and I don't want to seem braggy or something) when I would reach out to Him myself, but for me, it was bittersweet hope mixed in with a ""That's it?"" followed by many tears for feeling trapped in something I never expected I'd find myself falling into and that I wasn't worth enough for God to release this entity/demon burden from me I felt like I had to embrace since it seemed like I had no other choice.

Catholicism failed me. I've been to confession and all that, and I have spoken to priests about the problem. It was all responded with ""Just say in Jesus name, I tell you to leave,"" which did absolutely nothing. One exorcist priest shrugged off the problem, and I contacted him twice. The Rosary ended up giving me more pain than expected due to the accounts of the Virgin helping people specifically with these circumstances, but it made me feel like everything had to be centered around her choice for me to be able to approach God at all.

I have had Orthodoxy linger as an interest for a while. I remember watching a video on some hermits and I was deeply touched by the humility of this man. I've read some things, and the overall tone and teachings of Orthodoxy feels more at home, like approachable and ""just right"" if that makes sense. There are no hurdles or anything like that to be able to come back to God, it seems.

I feel stuck in the occult mess I got in, but I would really like to see what Orthodoxy has to offer and due to the growing influence I see it having in my life, I'm wondering if this might be for me. I'm not trying to throw any shade at Catholicism. It just seemed to worsen the situation and made me feel more distant from God. I feel like despite the things I got into. I feel like I really yearn for and in a way ""miss"" God, like that feeling that I just want to go home and I want Him to be there to help make things better instead of feeling like that yearning will only ever be unrequited because He doesn't care and why would He in the end? Yet I also feel like I shouldn't give up on Him. 

I'm sorry for the long post, and I thank anyone who read this far at all. Any advice, prayers, etc, would be heavily appreciated. I have thought about fasting, too, so I'll be looking more into that.

Thanks so much.

Delayed catechism and fear of life confession (long post),throwaway462851,1593480015,"Hello brothers and sisters. Lately there have been two things that have bothered me: my delayed conversion due to covid and my impending life confession. I’ll be honest, I’m 17 and come from a secular family, but I am eager lead a pious life. I have trust in God, and have begun to feel close to Him the more I pray. I’ve been repenting of all of my sins (way more than I would’ve realized before) and I feel very peaceful.

My parish had conveniently began catechism classes shortly after I started attending, and I was very excited to go to them. I was only able to attend one seminar before everything shut down. I’m not mad, just upset. This is a very unique set of circumstances and I’m aware the world doesn’t revolve around me. Now that services have started up again nothing has been said of catechism classes. All I’ve been able to do is read about the church (any book suggestions?) and while that’s great it still pains me that this virus has created an obstacle in joining the church.

But what really scares me is my life confession. I’m not 100% sure that there is a life confession at my parish, but I was told there would be “an examination by the priest and/or confession after catechism”. 

My past sins disgust me to say the least and they include:

1. Frequent masturbation
2. Never thinking about/praying to God
3. Marijuana consumption/driving home high once
4. Having inside jokes with my friends that involved autistic individuals who went to my school (Lord have mercy)
5. Joking about a school shooting in front of someone who literally just hours before had been at school when one happened (God help me)
6. Dark jokes involving things like 9/11 and the holocaust
7. stealing video games from my aunt once
8. Lying
9. Lots of gossip
10. Lots of pride

Whenever I think about these things (especially 4, 5 and 6) I feel like crying. I ask God to forgive me and I have faith that he will, but I can’t bear the thought of having to tell my priest, someone who barely even knows me, these things that make me seem like a terrible person.

I have changed, I really have, I want the old me to die. I want to be baptized and forgiven. I want to become an Orthodox Christian and lead a life of piety. I want to keep the fasts and abstain from sin. 

If anyone has any advice or information I would greatly appreciate it. I just kind of wanted to let all these feelings out.

Is Localism Becoming An Idol Among Certain Orthodox?,teawar,1593474181,"I've noticed a distinct Orthodox fondness for distributism and for the general idea of hearth and home, at least online. It's shared by many Catholics and Reformed Protestants. It greatly appeals to me, but sometimes I doubt if it's a truly biblical idea.

Christ tells us to love our enemies and forsake our families if necessary, and we're told that this home is not our home. It can be deduced from this that the life of a wandering celibate is the purest life, and all others are inferior. Dedicating time and treasure to helping one's community and neighbors and providing mutual aid is something even pagans can admire and get behind; there's no Christian heroism there. We shouldn't push for ownership and prosperity, which people claim will be the end goals of successful distributist policy. We should work as wage slaves, eat beans and rice if that's all we can afford, and thank God for it. Anything more than that puts us above the lilies of the field.

First, thank you for reading another post by someone searching for truth...I'm sure they are slightly tiresome in this subreddit by now.

I want to convert but I really have two concerns. First, I am concerned by the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church within Orthodoxy in general. Maybe this sounds stupid and trivial,  but with the limited research I've done it seems quite clear to me that Putin is using that Church's leadership as a tool for Russian nationalist pride generally and to legitimize his ""presidency"" more specifically. I want to join a community dedicated to the proper worship of Christ, not a community being influenced by a former KGB agent suggesting his politics and ambitions are endorsed by the Creator. I suppose I'm simply looking for some affirmation/comfort that nationalist politics and distractions from any ethnic political programs arent an issue people are experiencing on a broad scale, especially in America. 

The second issue is a little more personal, and im curious if I could hear from some average middle class suburbanite former protestants that converted...my whole childhood was formed by the American version of Christianity, with Christmas on the 25th of December and coffee cake after church. Additionally, I have a job that could put me in any city at any point and I dont want my Church life to be dominated by tiny churches consisting of 12 people for the foreseeable future. Maybe its selfish (its definitely selfish) but I would like to be a member of a thriving church community. And im also afraid of what it will be like to shift my whole perspective of Christian and church life to a completely different cultural mindset. I love the theology of the EOC, its the community lifestyle I'm nervous about.

Shall I say with simplicity, perhaps truthfully: ""No, Lord, I do not love You?"" This radical denial does not quite produce the right sound. For even in my worst failings the memory and image of the Savior are never completely erased form my mind, do not cease to attract me. What a complex situation for the sinner who, form the depths of his misery and without having the strength to break his bonds, yet turns his head towards Him with whom he longs to be united. The only answer which I can give is: ""Lord, You know all things, You know that I want to love you; give me Your love."" - Archimandrite Lev Gillet, of blessed memory",OrthodoxChristianity

I'm leaving the Roman Catholic Church,ikayakayaki,1593446399,"It has been a long time coming. Around 15 years ago, I was a catechumen in the OCA. Through my great sins, I fell away from the catechumenate. Around two years later, I found my way into the doors of the Catholic Church. It was closer and more familiar to my Western heart. I rationalized away the banal liturgies, the poor catechesis, the confusing papal pronouncements. I loved my parish and I loved my diocese. I still do. 

I guess I left the East, but the East never left me. I would often pray in front of my icons, and listen to Orthodox chant. I could never wrap my head around many Catholic teachings - like indulgences, for example. I would often ""check in"" on my old Orthodox parish. I think I kept the Orthodox Church as a fallback plan in case the Catholic church went ""off the rails"". 

I was a leader in my parish, an RCIA teacher, CCD teacher, choir member. Two years ago I entered formation for the diaconate in my diocese. Around 18 months ago, I began to have serious doubts about the diaconate as well as the Catholic Church in general. It's been an agonizing period, but I have finally made a choice to return to the Orthodox Church. I have resigned from formation, and many people are finding out and reaching out to me. I'm having to have many difficult conversations. 

Ultimately, I feel that I need to work out my salvation in the Church that Christ founded, and that this can only be the Eastern Orthodox Church. There are many issues that led me to opening my mind up to this as a possibility after so many years as a Catholic, but ultimately I think it all comes down to what you believe about Papal Supremacy. Once I could no longer hold to the definition of Vatican I, most other objections fell easily. I guess I'm just trying to share these thoughts with people who might understand, as I'm having to share them over and over again with people I've disappointed. Please pray for me.

Oriental Orthodox + Assyrian Church of the East. Reading material + how to find and visit a parish.,LandofLemons,1593419470,"Apologies for posting on here, however, the subreddits for each of these churches are incredibly inactive!

I've been researching different religions, and been quite focused on expressions of Christianity for a bit. I've been in contact with Orthodox priests, been reading the material they've recommended, doing Catechism classes etc. I've also been doing RCIA, and reading the material recommended for that.

However, I've had a bit more trouble getting consistent information on the Oriental Orthodox church, and the Assyrian Church of the East. If anyone can please recommend reliable reading material and general information (whether in podcast/youtube/some niche blog form). And how does one go about locating an Oriental Orthodox or Assyrian Church of the East parish? Every time I try to find places, either a different country comes up or Eastern rite Catholic Churches :(",OrthodoxChristianity
Logistics of baptism + piercings,LandofLemons,1593417932,"Was wondering whether piercings would have to be removed for baptism. Now this question is more specifically in terms of adults, BUT there are cultures where a girl's ears are pierced by the nurse in the hospital where she is born. Since baptism is 40 days after birth, and I'm sure baby's ears will still be sensitive, must their earrings be removed?

Additionally I wonder about the general unacceptability of piercings and tattoos in Orthodoxy. Since I've read quite a bit about the Catholic stance, and the Oriental Orthodox stance I (wrongly) assumed it would be much the same. Now I know this stance is not dogmatic by any means, but generally there is quite a bit of opposition to tattoos and piercings. Pointing to Leviticus (which Acts of the Apostles negates with regards to this particular issue from what I've read), and 1 Corinthians (your body is a temple, but do you not decorate your temples with icons?).

In addition nose rings are mentioned even in genesis, and Ezekiel where Jesus is talking about Jerusalem: ""I adorned you with ornaments: I put bracelets on your arms, a chain on your neck, a ring on your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head. You were adorned with gold and silver, while your clothing was of fine linen, rich fabric, and embroidered cloth. You had choice flour and honey and oil for food. You grew exceedingly beautiful, fit to be a queen.""
Ezekiel 16:11‭-‬13 NRSV-CI

So I wonder why there is such a trend to be unaccepting of these things, I know some priests are more accepting than others and there is the whole ""come as you are"" thing but from what I've read not many priests would say ""sure, go get a piercing/tattoo"". Modesty is also something that is likely taken into account, but there is also a cultural relevance to modesty. It would hardly be modest for a modern woman to walk around in a Victorian Era gown (in most contexts), though she'd be covered. And a Hawaiian man having his chest uncovered, would not be a cause for concern as the traditional dress deems this acceptable-it does not draw attention to him. These days, in many places it is rather normal for women (and even men) to have some piercings, or tattoos. Of course being covered by tattoos might draw attention. From what I've read there have even been saints, identified by their tattoos. Would someone be so kind as to explain this stance to me, so that I may better understand the motivations?",OrthodoxChristianity

Consistency,tolkoska,1593415816,"For the past few months I have been struggling with consistency.

Generally it goes like this: a week or two of nepsis and trying very hard, praying, etc.; then it slowly deteriorates until I find myself committing the same sins from when I used to be pagan and atheist. 

From there it goes one of two ways: the next day I either bounce back and continue on the good path for a few days; or I continue sinning until I am thoroughly disgusted and the cycle continues.

I feel like when I can go to school again after the lockdown it will get better, but I feel I am just kidding myself. I have tried to persuade my parents to go to church with me  after the lockdown but no promises were made( they also are orthodox).

Clever ways to share the gospel,Kinglens311,1593377666,,OrthodoxChristianity
Clever ways to share the gospel,Orion2087,1593376887,"1. Wall quotes and house decorations

&amp;#x200B;

Decorating your house with scriptures and other similar decorations is not only a great way to witness to all of your guests and neighbors, it’s also something God actually commanded the Israelites to do. Consider this passage in the Old Testament:

“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates"" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9).

You can buy these quotes on eBay or Amazon, or you can find a local vinyl shop to make them for you. They are made of vinyl, and they simply stick to your wall. They only cost about $6-20 per quote, and most online sellers will do custom orders for you (if they don’t have a scripture you’d like).

Think about it: a wall quote is usually far less money than a painting or picture frame, and it reveals God’s wonderful truth!

Other ways you can decorate your house include the following:

\- Garden flags with scriptures, crosses, etc. on them.

\- Nativity scenes during the holidays, instead of Santa or pagan decorations.

\- Paintings of religious scenes.

\- 10 commandments stone or plaque display in your yard or on your wall.

Adrian Rogers once made a great point. He said, ""Sometimes we Christians get all upset when they take down the 10 commandments from some public building. Question: ""How many of you have the 10 commandments posted in your own home?"" Great point, Adrian!

&amp;#x200B;

2. Bible in your office or work area

&amp;#x200B;

Another easy way for you to witness to others about Jesus is to show people how much you value the word of God. Consider having a Bible on your desk at the office, in your home, in your work area, etc. You can even keep a copy of the Bible in your car. Of course, you can use other decorations, too.

By doing this, you’re showing others that you read the Bible regularly and that you hold God’s word in high esteem. It will also be handy in case you have the opportunity to witness to someone verbally. You can also get in a quick reading or devotional during lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Decorations for your Car (radio, Bible)

&amp;#x200B;

Decorating your car with classy symbols or bumper stickers is also a great way to share the gospel with other drivers. Just make sure you don’t suffer from excessive road rage or speeding, for that would be a horrible testimony!

Here are things you can do with your car to share Jesus:

Hang a cross from the mirror.

Bumper sticker or vinyl decoration with a scriptural quote or the name of Jesus.

Front tag or rear tag with Christian symbols or scriptures (I have  the ""Jesus Fish"" on the front of my car which matches the colors of my car).

Keeping your radio stations programmed to Christian music or good preaching stations. I have Dr. J Vernon McGee’s 5-year ""Thru the Bible"" program on a jump drive in my car radio, and it has been a great blessing when we drive anywhere! He covers the entire Bible verse by verse.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Gospel tracts

&amp;#x200B;

gospel tracts are small pieces of paper with the gospel message printed or written on them. You can get them from most churches, and you can also find them in printable form on the Internet.

There are lots of opportunities for you to give these out. For example, you can give them out to your cashier at the grocery store, to people soliciting money on the street (perhaps with a small donation), in public areas, and so forth. All you have to do is smile and say, ""Hello, may I give you this?"" Most people will agree to take it.

You could even take a day to write a personal story about what Jesus has done for you, and then add a short section on how to be saved.

gospel tracts may seem outdated, but I’ve heard many people talk about being saved from a gospel tract!

&amp;#x200B;

5. Social media/online

&amp;#x200B;

Many people have blogs, social media accounts, and so forth. What a perfect opportunity to stand up for Jesus Christ! I’m not saying you must have a social media account, but if you already have a blog or social media presence, why not use that space to tell others about Jesus? Talk about church events. Talk about how much God means to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Post scriptures on your account or on your profile. Share helpful articles and videos that explain God’s truth so that your others will notice and have an opportunity to be saved. Share funny memes. There are many opportunities to really impact your followers. The ungodly sure use it to spread their junk. I say let’s use it to spread Jesus! Also talk about your shortcomings and how thankful you are that Christ died to pay the penalty for your sins.

However, don’t use the same account to show pictures of you drinking beer with your friends, having cleavage pop our of your shirt, and all the other nonsense that people post on the social networks. It goes against the very Bible you’re trying to preach!

&amp;#x200B;

6. Text messaging

&amp;#x200B;

Even if you don’t want to orally share the gospel on the phone, you can always use text to send scriptures, share articles, invite people to church, etc. Text messaging is a great way to talk to others about Jesus, or invite them to a church event.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Holiday cards

&amp;#x200B;

If you send out cards for birthdays, Christmas, or other holidays, buy cards that have scriptures in them. Otherwise, consider writing a scripture in the message of the card. That is a great way to share God’s word in a friendly way. It helps put people’s mind back on the most important thing in the universe: our Lord and savior Jesus Christ.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Praying for meals at work or restaurants

&amp;#x200B;

We should never pray a vain prayer for the malicious reason to be seen by others others. Jesus warned against making prayers for this purpose:

“And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you"" (Matthew 6:5-6).

Jesus isn’t condemning all forms of public prayer, in fact, for even he prayed publicly:

""Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted"" (John 6:11).

Genuine prayer is a great way to witness to others about your faith in Jesus! Think about it: suppose you sit down in a crowded office to have lunch, but you stop, bow your head, and say a quick prayer privately. Someone may be watching you out of the corner of their eye, and your prayer may speak to their conscience.

Even if you’re with a coworker who is non-religious, you could say something like: ""Excuse me while I give thanks to the Lord"", or ""Do you mind if I give thanks for this meal?"" Most people will consent. Just don’t do it in an ""I’m holier than you"" kind of way.

&amp;#x200B;

9. Email signatures

&amp;#x200B;

If you use email often, you can usually create ""signatures"", which is just a short phrase or paragraph that will automatically post at the end of every message you write. Why not put a scripture like John 3:16 in that signature and say: ""This is my favorite Bible verse"", or something similar. Alternatively, you could just say something about Jesus.

In addition, you can even choose email addresses with something about Jesus in it. It’s a quick and easy way to share the gospel without being pushy.

&amp;#x200B;

10. Business Cards

&amp;#x200B;

If you hand out a lot of business cards, consider posting a scripture on the back, or along the bottom. If nothing else, you can post a Jesus fish or a cross. That’s an easy way to let others know that you are a Christian, and that Jesus means something to you.

&amp;#x200B;

11.  Clothing/apparel with quotes

&amp;#x200B;

Another easy way to witness without speaking is to wear clothing with scripture, crosses, or the ""Jesus fish"" symbol on them. There are plenty of hats, t-shirts, tote bags, backpacks, jewelry, and more.

I’m not saying that your entire wardrobe has to be like this, or that you must wear this every day. I certainly don’t. But isn’t this an easy way to share Jesus? I mean, a tastefully designed hat with a cross isn’t tacky. Most people are already sharing something on their clothing. People wear clothing with NIKE swooshes, various logos, and everything else.

Why not have at least a hat or a couple of shirts that represent the most important being in the world, who offers salvation freely to whosoever believes on him? Shouldn’t we be willing to represent Jesus? However, I would warn against getting tattoos in this same way. God discourages that practice.

&amp;#x200B;

12. The name of the Wi-Fi connection

&amp;#x200B;

When I set up the Wi-Fi router in my house, I had to scan my computer for other signals. I had an idea: why not name my router something to tell others about Jesus? So I named my Wi-Fi connection ""Jesus\_Saves"". Anytime someone searches for Internet signals to connect to, they’ll see this name. It’s simple, yet it may speak to someone one day. Who knows how the Lord may use that?

&amp;#x200B;

13. Letting your light shine

&amp;#x200B;

Last but not least, we can witness silently in the way that we lead our daily lives. Jesus told us to let our light shine before others:

""In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven"" (Matthew 5:16).

When we treat people with respect, help out those in need, and stand for righteousness in a wicked world, it can do wonders. Someone once said: ""A glowing Christian testimony is worth an entire library full of arguments.""

Let's try to share our faith through our way of life, and let's try to make people understand how happy we are to have Jesus.",OrthodoxChristianity
Thinking of converting to Eastern Orthodoxy instead of to (traditional) Catholicism,anewrenewal,1593376583,"As an atheist, I recently came to believe in God and Jesus Christ. As the title suggests, I'm seriously considering converting to Eastern Orthodoxy. I was currently planning to begin catechesis for traditional Catholicism at an FSSP parish in a couple months, but now I'm starting to have doubts about whether or not the Catholic Church is the one, true church. My doubts came about from reading blogs from different orthodox converts as well as from watching some Orthodox Christians' videos on YouTube and I found their refutations of Catholicism to be solid. I will admit, my understanding of theology and Church history is very basic compared to them, but advanced enough to know that Protestantism is completely out of the picture for me. Can anyone here who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy tell me why you chose that over (traditional) Catholicism?

"In my opinion, many of the representatives in Balad (a Palestinian political party in Israel) are modern-day versions of John the Baptist",AntAr2006,1593369748,"In the Bible, John the Baptist vocally criticizes the Jewish King, King Herod, and gets his head chopped off for it.

Today, as a result of many representatives in Balad criticizing Israel, many of them are sent to jail, or, Zionist politicians try to make them ineligible for the Knesset.

For example, Israel tried to jail Azmi Bishara for vocally praising Hezbollah and Hafez al-Assad, and then when Israel and Hezbollah went to war, they concocted a charge based on his history that he was collaborating with Hezbollah.

Likewise, when Haneen Zoabi and Heba Yazbak praise those who are against Zionism and then criticize Zionsim themselves, right-wing representatives try to disqualify them from Parliament. This is ridiculous, I thought Israel was a democracy.

Also, when Said Nafa merely went to visit Syria for a few days to express solidarity with the Syrian government against the Western-Zionist-Wahabi backed plot against it, they sent him to jail for it.

So, the current Israeli government is King Herod, and these Balad representatives are John the Baptist. This is my 2 cents.",OrthodoxChristianity

What Keeps Me from Monasticism,Snoo_7424,1593332521,"I have felt a calling to monasticism since childhood. I returned to the Church 2 years ago after falling away for years. I still feel the call, but here are my problems, and I appreciate any input.

I'm in my early 40s. Not old, but a tad long in the tooth. I don't know if any monasteries have age limits. I do have some health problems, but nothing that makes me incapable of physical work, though doing a full metania will take me a bit of effort, and lots of those happen in monasteries.

One big concern is my parents, who are older. I have a close relationship with them, and I know they will be hurt by my leaving. I worry what will happen if they get gravely ill, and who will take care of them. My two married sisters, who live close by, are usually doing their own thing, and don't come around very often. Their kids are grown, so that's not an excuse anymore. In short, I feel like I am abandoning them. As the ""baby"" who never married, I know that there may be attachment issues going both ways. I don't know how to fix that, and it's above you folks' pay grade. I would love to know how others deal with parents, and I have read about parents who make all sorts of trouble when their children go into monasticism, which I don't anticipate, and mine are Protestant.

"Orthodox view on protestant ""Visions"" of hell.",alex765511,1593324306,"Many have probably came across videos/books of protestants telling their ""testimony"" of visiting hell. I wanted to know the Orthodox opinion.

One of the things I have been wondering about is the Orthodox view of these ""testimonies"". It might sound silly but videos like ""Man dies and goes to hell for 30 minutes talks about the torments"" really made me reconsider my sinful lifestyle.

Bill Wiese' story of hell is what got me looking back to Christianity. His theology isn't much different from most western evangelicals and the only reason I could see for him making it up of either for attention or book sales. Besides that his sermons appear honest and he really seems like he wants people to come to Christ.

The thing is with these testimony are they are always very western in their depiction of hell (A lake of fire away from God with devils torturing people in cages). These testimonies are sometimes outright are ""anti-Orhtodox/Catholic"" with one girl's vision I remember claiming she saw her grandma in hell for ""Worshiping Mary"".

The Necessity To Be In The Right Church?,Lumec7,1593296269,"I am on my way to becoming Orthodox, and I am trying to convince my parents who are kind of Dutch Reformed but not strict - wich shows in the fact they agree alot with of the Orthodox perspectives like the atonment theory for example. They also acknowledge that Icons and Traditions are not in conflict with the Bible. All in all, they're very agreeable, and who would have thougth otherwise? they almost don't have dogma so everything that sounds right they just add to their beliefs. So, all laid out in front of them - they are still not convinced in the necessity to be in the right Church. They think that they cant just leave their old Community behind for the ""extra's"" that the Orthodox Church has to offer wich they easily can incorporate in their own personal beliefs. They think that their church community and their way of living is enough as it is.

So my questions are 
1- how can I show the necessity of Being in the (right) Church?
2- What is the right way to leave your old church community?

Thanks in advance!

Questions about highly rigid ascetic expectations for lay people,OBSLS,1593284085,"Hi everyone. I picked up a book called “The Path to Salvation” by St. Theophan the Recluse, and started reading it with the goal of understanding more about... well, the nature of Salvation. This book struck me for the way that it requires lay people to engage in a high level of self denial, not only with respect to committing sins but also towards seemingly all amusements and enjoyment. 

The logic seems to be that perfect emotional self mastery will equip you to spend your life doing good works without yielding to distraction or temptation. Ok, fair enough, but this also seems like a heavier yoke to bear than even Christ and the Apostles expected in the New Testament. 

On the one hand, I understand that if a Christian were to undertake a path like this and succeed (by God’s grace), it would be extremely good. But on the other hand, this is definitely not the expectation that priests have for lay people, yet this book is written as if this level of asceticism is a requirement and goal for all Christians.

I’m a beginner in the (orthodox) faith, so these questions are in a sense above my pay grade. I couldn’t resist reading ahead. My expectation is that I’m going to be told to disregard it for now and discuss with my priest - which is all well and good. But I also wanted to get the input of this sub. What do you think of the extremely rigid expectations of some Orthodox books of instruction vs. The perhaps more realistic expectations of priests. What does God expect?",OrthodoxChristianity

Not exactly what I had in mind.....Chrismation,ssflne,1593260912,"Very long story short. 

Started attending an Orthodox Church almost two years ago. I have four kids and am married. 

Our first priest had to leave due to health issues after a year of us being there. We were to the point of discussing Godparents, despite not having finished catechism, because our kids are not baptized and they needed to be. Essentially we would agree to complete classes though. His health issues come up, he takes leave, comes back, turns out not all better, he takes very long leave so Bishop removes him and puts in new priest. 

New priest is a good guy, younger, and has kids our age. That said, we’ve talked once 1:1 6 months ago. Says after Christmas we will discuss what needs to be done to complete process as we were not the only ones kind of left in the wind. 

He starts a class, we attended a couple, and then COVID cancels everything. They started regular services with limited attendance a couple of weeks ago, but require masks for 2+ years old and between that and the fact we can’t receive communion we opted to not take the place of others who might want to receive communion (never discussed this with priest). 

We get a text and email from his assistant yesterday, that Fr. has decided to chrismate us, and let us know if anyone needs to be baptized, if we have questions we could email or text Fr. 

I just feel almost disappointed? I loved our previous priest. I’m not even positive our new priests knows all our kids names, he doesn’t remember we told him the kids have never been baptized. I feel like I’ve waited two years for almost no reason. Should I just accept the offer of chrismation? Should I address my feelings first? We haven’t had a 1:1 conversation in almost 6 months, and then he has his assistant essentially send us text announcing what’s supposed to be a pretty big deal???",OrthodoxChristianity

A question about confession and communion in Orthodoxy?,WanderingSojourner,1593179396,"Hello, r/OrthodoxChristianity. 

This has probably been asked a million times before, but I'm still a bit confused on the details about confession in Orthodoxy. Particularly how it's related to taking communion and the state of one's soul. 

Please pardon any mistakes or ignorance on my part. 

As far as I'm aware, confession in EO is a bit different than it is in the RCC. There isn't the distinction between mortal and venial sin as there is in Catholicism and confession is more of a recognition of how one separated themselves from God, what they can do to make it better, and how they not try not to repeat the sin again. 

That being said, again as far as I'm aware, one needs to confess before they take communion, similar to the RCC. But if there isn't such a legalistic categorization mortal sin as there is in Catholicism, what spiritually/metaphysically happens if one takes communion before they confess?

Furthermore, if one dies before they confess, does that automatically mean they go to hell?

A lot of things frustrate me for example monks (I thought you could trust them) who teach complete nonsense about the scripture (for example one told a story about an angle killing a kid because it was,,cursed“ by his father's words, a curse that is unrighteousness is not valid as I understood from the scriptures).

I have the fear to put a child in this world when the time comes because it's that worse and I fear that my child might be mislead. I try so hard but I always fail, I can't stand it anymore.

What is the Orthodox Church's position on armed resistance to foreign occupation and armed resistance? Did this Palestinian Orthodox Priest either violate or adhere to Orthodox teaching?,AntAr2006,1593087936,"So back in 2003, Father (now Archbishop) Atallah Hanna encouraged armed resistance to the Israeli occupation and praised ""martyrdom operations."" Now I personally support the Palestinian cause and I understand why some people feel that they need to take up arms against armed foreign occupiers to free their land. But, I am not sure if Archbishop Hanna is referring to suicide bombings, and if he is, I don't support that (keep in mind it's a MEMRI article, so just because they say in certain contexts that he was referring to suicide bombings doesn't think he is, I just want to see how you all interpret it). I've shared some quotes from Hanna below, and have provided the link to the article below, and I am wondering, did Archbishop Hanna violate Orthodox teachings with these statements? Thanks for any answers. 

Here are some quotes: 

""""We do not believe in so-called 'peace with Israel' because peace cannot be made with Satan. Israel is the greatest Satan. No concession and no truce must be made \[with Israel\]. Any type of peace with this entity is concession, submission, and retreat from pan-Arab and national principles… The negotiations and the other attempts \[at an arrangement\] will not restore the Palestinians' rights to them. The Palestinians' rights will be restored only by resistance. What was taken by force will be restored only by force…""

""Resistance is the obligation of every Palestinian Christian Arab, as it is the obligation of every Palestinian Muslim Arab.""

""We encourage our youth to participate in the resistance, to carry out martyrdom attacks, and to participate in removing the occupation. There is a need for resistance to the occupation, and for Islamic-Christian cooperation, so that we will remove the foreign Zionist Jewish intruders and so that the gates of Palestine will open wide and all those who were uprooted or emigrated in 1967 and 1948 will return…""

""From this holy Church, and in the presence of all the believing clerics, we give today a prayer for the sake of the souls of our *Shahids* and resistors and for the sake of our heroic Palestinian people, whether living in the homeland or outside it… We say to the sons of our people: 'Do not retreat, do not fear, and do not despair.' The Arab Palestinian right to this land is stronger than any false Zionist military ammunition, which will disappear sooner or later. This is because the Zionist entity plundering our lands and our holy places is an entity that cannot maintain stability, and its end will be to disappear, just like all kinds of colonialism on our land in the past have disappeared.""[\[3\]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-christian-leader-praise-martyrdom-operations-and-formation-muslim-and-christian#_edn3)

Hanna spoke out in praise of suicide attacks: ""We declare publicly our blessing, support, and legitimization of the brave Palestinian resistance \[carried out\] by any means, including the brave ***Fidaiyin***[\[4\]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-christian-leader-praise-martyrdom-operations-and-formation-muslim-and-christian#_edn4) martyrdom operations… The names of the ***Fidaiyi Shahids*** \[the martyrs\] will be inscribed in the history of our Palestinian and Arab people in holy white letters. The voices of those who defame these acts of heroism and honor are nothing more than anomalous voices that do not represent Arab and Palestinian public opinion…""

""The ***Fidaiyin*** martyrdom operations aimed deep inside Israel are unique pioneer operations that deter the Zionist enemy. They have caused great damage to this enemy, which understands nothing but the language of force and thinks that only force will bring peace. We say to the enemy: 'Leave our land, our Jerusalem, and our holy places. This is Arab Palestinian land, that has no connection whatsoever to the Jews and the Zionists'…""

""Martyrdom operations are an excellent and good way to resist the Zionist invasion of the Palestinian land. In front of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, we bless the souls of the heroic *Shahids* and the families of the *Shahids*. We demand that these families be looked after, helped, and adopted, because the occupation targets them.""[\[5\]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-christian-leader-praise-martyrdom-operations-and-formation-muslim-and-christian#_edn5)

Hanna also told the delegation: ""The ***Fidaiyin*** are the heroes of this nation. We are proud of them and resolutely refuse any attempt to defame their deeds… They are not committing suicide, as some claim, and they are not terrorists, as others claim – they are resisting the occupation. We unreservedly support the martyrdom operations."" Hanna also called on ""Palestinian Arab Christians to participate in resisting the occupation in all forms, since they are part of the Palestinian people and of this nation."" He said, ""True reform is reform that must provide an answer to the question of how it is possible to escalate the resistance in all ways, so as to actualize our national goals.""[\[6\]](https://www.memri.org/reports/palestinian-christian-leader-praise-martyrdom-operations-and-formation-muslim-and-christian#_edn6)

Veneration of certain modern people?,Down_With_The_King,1593053598,"As Constantinople has been glorifying recent (21st century) saints recently, I've been wondering some things. Fyodor Dostoevsky, Vladimir Lossky, and Fr Seraphim Rose all seem to be extremely popular Orthodox figures. Why are they not venerated or called saints by anyone? From the little I have seen, their lives and works are very edifying and even helped convert some to Orthodoxy. I do not see why they should not be worthy of veneration. Although I do know a group that insists that ROCOR glorified Fr Seraphim. But even if that were not true, it's not like we need to wait for someone to be on the calendar so we can venerate them - sometimes holiness is simply evident to all, and to me it seems to be the case with these three people.

So my question is, why does nobody call them saints (except for Fr Seraphim occassionally)?",OrthodoxChristianity

It's a pretty large church community, about 150 people on a regular Sunday, and mostly Greeks or Greek-Americans. We have Sunday school for anyone ages 3-18 (that's right, we do Sunday school through high school!!). Usually the sermon is at the end of the service, just before dismissal, and we go straight to the church basement for coffee hour/pick up your kids from Sunday school hour. There's a men's prayer/community service group, women's prayer/community service  group, and co-ed Bible study. We also have age-specific groups that are just for socializing and an annual festival-fundraiser. Also my favorite church inside joke is the protopresbyter loves Star Trek and always says ""Christ has risen"" in Klingon at least once every Easter.

Asking For Resources and Thoughts: Prayers to Saints,Mike_DT,1593027739,"Hello all! I hope you are having a good day.

I'm a Protestant seriously considering the EO church. As a Protestant, I think it is fair to say that the single greatest barrier preventing me from joining the Church is the practice of praying to saints. I'm (1) concerned that it seems too close to idolatry from a biblical point of view, and (2) concerned that this practice has basically reached the level of dogma of being Eastern Orthodox. In other words, I would not be allowed to become Eastern Orthodox if I refused to do it. If I'm wrong on that point, please feel free to correct me.

I've read a fair bit about the defense of the practice through various Orthodox resources. As such, I am aware that:

a) This practice does not necessarily lead to idolatry in the intentions of Orthodox believers (even if abuses of it might do so), and most defenders of prayers to saints would also be adamantly against idolatry in any form.

b) Direct evidence of prayers to saints can be traced to as early as the 3nd century, and possibly inferred earlier.

c) Attempts to justify the practice from the Scripture/Deuterocanonical books have been offered. Nevertheless, I don't find them very convincing. Yes, I am aware that I am exercising the Protestant crime here of ""personal judgement,"" but it's a hard thing to shake. ;) Please have patience with me. If we are to judge Prayers to Saints as being in capital ""T"" Tradition, is it fair to assert that the \*primary\* rationale for this would be because it is the supposed oral teaching of the Apostles outside of Scripture? Or would it be better to even go a step further and say that the apostles \*did not\* teach it, but it came as a natural theological development within the Church and is now binding on believers because of the consensus reached in the Church?

I'd appreciate thoughts that anyone has to offer.

**Also, does anyone have a link to a collection of liturgical prayers that I would be expected to pray if I became Orthodox?** I'd like to see if the claim that Orthodox only ask for intercession really pans out. If it does, this would be a much easier thing for me to consider.

Purgatory and the Synod of Jerusalem,athumbhat,1592969348,"&gt; And such as though envolved in mortal sins have not departed in despair, but have, while still living in the body, repented, though without bringing forth any fruits of repentance — by pouring forth tears, forsooth, by kneeling while watching in prayers, by afflicting themselves, by relieving the poor, and in fine by shewing forth by their works their love towards God and their neighbour, and which the Catholic Church hath from the beginning rightly called satisfaction — of these and such like the souls depart into Hades, and there endure the punishment due to the sins they have committed. **But they are aware of their future release** from thence, and are delivered by the Supreme Goodness, through the prayers  of the Priests, and the good works which the relatives of each do for their Departed; especially the unbloody Sacrifice availing in the highest degree; which each offereth particularly for his relatives that have fallen asleep, and which the Catholic and Apostolic Church offereth daily for all alike; it being, of course, understood that we know not the time of their release. For that there is deliverance for such from their direful condition, and that before the common resurrection and judgment we know and believe; but when we know not.

Now, is this not essentially the Roman teaching on purgatory, or at least the modern roman teaching? The bold part especially seems to indicate that the Orthodox at one point believed in the concept of purgatory or at least something very similar.

I'm not Orthodox, however, I love learning about religion. So I've been talking to 2 different orthodox priests from different parishes, taking online Catechism classes, and reading a lot. At the same time I'm doing inquiry into a couple of other religions/expressions.

Anyway, with regards to the reception into the catechumenate, how is it usually done? The one priest I'm talking to (he's more Conservative, and left the old calendrist church years ago to come back into communion with the Orthodox church, his parish is also a mission parish that's quite multi-cultural, falls under the Greek church). He feels comfortable receiving inquirers into the catechumenate after about 2 months of inquiry, and then doing catechism until the person in question is prepared to be baptised + chrismated whether that takes 6 months or 3 years.

The other priest (a bigger parish where there is another priest, and it's Greek), requires inquirers to show their commitment over about 6 months, completing the Catechism classes and then only being received into the catechumenate shortly before baptism (if I understood correctly).

What is usually done? I was under the impression that the first was standard, but when I discussed it with the second priest this was his way of going about things. Are there further alternatives?",OrthodoxChristianity

The Place of Reason,DadHocHypothesis,1592853934,"So after encountering the Street Epistemology method and its discussion of the Socratic Method, I've wondered about why I ought to believe what I profess to believe as a Christian. I've got a passing familiarity with Aquinas and with St. Anselm's Ontological Argument, but as I'm not willing to follow Scholasticism to it's perfectly-parsed conclusion and become a Calvinist or a Tridentine-styled Roman Catholic, I'd like to hear Eastern perspectives on this.

As a faith where doubt and questioning do not seem to be unwelcome, and as one that's survived oppression from other religions with their own hefty philosophical traditions, and from atheists throughout Eastern Europe, I'm sure there should be at least *some* Orthodox apologetics out there for why theism is true generally, and Christianity specifically...

Struggling to connect to my parish,QuarantineSpecial,1592851348,"Apologies if these types of posts are common. I feel like there are some respectable people on this sub with good advice. 

I am a young adult in my 20s and I am struggling to connect with those at my parish, most of whom are above middle aged and have been together since the parish began. 

The parish has an interesting history,  starting off in the new age [Holy Order of MANS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Order_of_MANS#:~:text=The%20Holy%20Order%20of%20MANS%20was%20a%20religious%20order%20grounded,identifies%20it%20as%20New%20Age.). Eventually the parish found its way into canonical Orthodoxy. But the core group of boomers who met in the new age group are essentially all there is to the parish. I have been going there for almost 3 years now, was baptized and chrismated in the parish,  and in many ways feel like I am a second class parishioner (being younger and also not experiencing the group conversion to Orthodoxy that took place decades ago). Some on the parish council just view new members as a source of money since the parish is small and not that wealthy.

Prelest and typical prayer,namieco,1592841143,"So one of the things I’ve been learning about Orthodox Christianity is that you shouldn’t imagine things when talking to God and to not trust any emotional experiences.

Sounds fairly sensible. But as someone who is more familiar with the type of Christianity that encourages a close relationship with God, talking about everyday issues, trying to figure out what decisions are best etc., I’m having trouble balancing this. 

It’s not as though I have ever thought I’ve had a genuine spiritual experience (and would never want one as the idea seems scary to me) but I do get a lot of comfort from considering that I feel his presence or direction in life. I don’t think for sure he has spoke to me (how could I tell?), but I like entertaining the idea and feeling that he has been with me as I pray or prompted me towards something, otherwise it would feel pretty one-sided and lonely. Sometimes I imagine him or a Saint talking back to me as I ask questions for instance, but never would say I am certain it’s ‘really them’ talking to me, it’s just a way to get something back that often helps rather than feeling like I am talking into a void- and it’s often very useful and comforting.

How would an Orthodox Christian view this? 

For instance if I’m having a bad day and want to know what God thinks about certain problems, I might take myself into a room and try to relax and pray and if I’m lucky I might feel some sort of consultation or a prompt towards a certain decision.

Would this be prelest? If not, what’s the difference? If so, how can you have any sort of relationship with God if you have to distrust every feeling or experience?",OrthodoxChristianity

I tried to explain that Fr Seraphim gave his life to Christ, and repented for his past and homosexual behaviour and that he is a fantastic example for all Christians who happen to be LGBT, in that he was celibate and unmarried.

He would not listen. He insisted that because Seraphim Rose was gay, he should be venerated or looked up to, and should never have been a priest.

For me personally, Simply being homosexual isn't what I have a problem with. It's the lifestyle that often comes with it, and the idea they can get married.

The limbo in between Catholicism and Orthodox- what to do,namieco,1592765522,"So I’m a Catholic considering moving to the Orthodox Church. 

There is no Orthodox Church near me. Would it be acceptable to continue going to Catholic mass and doing the traditions I’m used to (liturgy of the hours etc) while I learn more about Orthodox Christianity?

The more I learn about the differences, the more my beliefs seem to side with Orthodox Christianity, especially concerning the pope, the dogmas and apparitions of Mary and the concept of annulment. So already I feel like a fraud going to a Catholic Church, but I need to keep God in my life and don’t know enough about Orthodox traditions and how to do them correctly to swap.

Without a local Orthodox Church, I also can’t really understand how the culture is different- how someone of Orthodox beliefs would approach life, problems and decisions compared to a Catholic. Orthodoxy appears to me more minimalistic and almost Buddhist- I prefer the emphasis on beauty and art I find in Catholicism.

So. Until I figure all this out and potentially move to an area where there is an Orthodox Church (moving in two years anyway) should I just continue as a Catholic with doubts?

Kind of related- I’m getting married soon. My partner is a (lovely, supportive) atheist. We were going to get married in a civil ceremony and have it convalidated by a priest after so I can continue receiving communion. Would it be wrong from an Orthodox point of view to get the marriage convalidated in the Catholic Church under these circumstances of doubt? But would the Orthodox Church frown on a civil ceremony if I decide to convert later?

Can a priest celebrate the Divine Liturgy and not hand out communion?,Charis_Humin,1592761721,"I just got home from our first Divine Liturgy back together as a community. As we went through the Liturgy everything moved along, he had the chalice and he filled it with bread and wine and zoan (I assume at least) but he didn't hand out communion, he just put it to the side in the sanctuary and then went straight to the homily. Is this allowed?

I know that in the Catholic Church, as long as the priest received the Eucharist then it was all good and that's why Catholic Priests can celebrate the Mass all by themselves, but I'm pretty sure that Orthodox Priests cannot celebrate the Liturgy by themselves, can they?

I’ve decided to not worry about damnation 🤗!,Lord_Have_Mercy123,1592760057,"I’ve made a number of posts here expressing worry and anxiety about being damned at the end. You know, I just don’t think that I’d a thing worth worrying about. I thought it was something specific to Orthodoxy, but people with my inclination toward existential dread will find a way to worry about it no matter what. If I were an atheist, I’d worry about the concept of “not existing”. If I were a protestant, I’d worry about having committed the “unforgivable sin” or being a reprobate - beyond saving - or simply not having truly been “saved” because my faith isn’t “bearing fruits of good works” yet. If I were a catholic, perhaps I’d worry about dying in an official state of mortal sin. The orthodox view is perhaps the most comforting. When you fall, you simply get back up. There’s a lot more emphasis on the process and faith not only in Christ’s resurrection, but on his continual effort to sanctify us at his pace if we only let him. It takes the emphasis of something we have to do (our faith bearing good works as in Protestantism) and puts it into God’s Hands. In fact, I’ve seen a number of posts on r/TrueChristian and r/Christianity where people worry about such things.

Jesus prayer question... concerned!,namieco,1592740722,"I’m a Catholic who is interested in Orthodox Christianity.

A few days ago, before I started thinking about Orthodox Christianity, I was feeling some intense emotions (to be honest I think they were typical hormone-related emotions but still unpleasant- anxiety and sadness). I sat down somewhere quiet as I couldn’t concentrate on work and out of nowhere got the urge to pray the Jesus Prayer. I don’t usually pray this but have heard a Catholic Bishop recommend it and in that moment felt it was needed.

I started saying it quietly over and over and my emotions intensified. I tried to just relax and go with it, as maybe they needed to be felt before they could go. It was very intense and I felt as if something was being pushed out of me or healed and I tried to just trust God as this was happening. Eventually I felt as if it had broken through and felt lots of light and space in me, almost a bit light headed. It was so intense I was convinced something had healed, somewhere, that something bad had been removed. 

After that I haven’t prayed it since, I’ve been busy, and have since become interested (for another reason) in Orthodox Christianity. I have read on here that the Jesus Prayer is a big controversial, that beginners shouldn’t pray it, and that it can even be dangerous. I’ve read as much as I can but still don’t understand why.

As the title says I'm Roman Catholic though before I fully committed to the Catholic church I would have considered myself a practicing Orthodox Christian. I went to DL, prayer and Orthodox pray rule and tried to observe traditional fasts. But I'd like to know why (I'm assuming) you all think I should convert to Orthodoxy. Here are some issues that made me commit to Catholicism that I would like you, if you'd be so kind, to address:

-Christ told us that we would know His disciples by their fruit (Mt. 7:15). For me it seems that Catholics were the ones who evangelized the world. Catholics have built schools, universities, hospitals, hospices, etc, in much higher numbers than any other denomination. When I thought of which church bore the most fruit, it seemed evident to me it was the Catholic church by a longshot (not trying to shame anyone so sorry if that sounded rude)

-There seems to be a lot of division in the Orthodox Church, or shall is say, churches. When I was practicing orthodoxy and was reading about the different church online it seemed that so many church especially in the east were threatening schism, claiming other churches to be heretics, actually creating schism, etc. I could never see the Orthodox Church as one church, just many churches with very similar beliefs.

-Without a unified church it becomes very hard to define doctrine on essential issues. I have heard from one Orthodox priest that abortion is ok in certain rare circumstances and that contraception with married couples is ok, but from another priest I hear that abortion is never morally permissable as well as contraception. Can't this lead to confusion amongst the faithful and present a danger of falling into sin unknowingly, even receiving the Eucharist in an unholy state?

-While many Orthodox christians might say that the Romans use their minds to such a degree that they end up trying to dissect God and not worship Him, I find the RCC's use of philosophy and catathatic theology to help give us and understanding of our spiritual lives in which it is very easy to see, after some study, where I am failing in my life and how to remedy it. I kinda perceive the Orthodox view of sactification as ""just sit in the silence with God and let the unknown sink in. This will inevitably lead to holiness because God will show you your faults in the silence"" and the RCC's view as ""through understanding where you are in your spiritual life, you won't make the mistake of thinking you are ready for higher levels of mystical contemplation. Just grow in virtue, follow His will, and everyday you will be better equipped to sit with the stillness"". After thinking for years that the RCC didn't have a mystical tradition now find that to be false. Basically, I find the RCC has both a solid intellectual and mystical tradition while the East has only the latter.

-It seems that there are many church father's who defend the office of the bishop of rome as having primacy over the church. That being said, there are also many church father's who don't and reject this idea. I feel that while this may be confusing to me at times, the fact that all my last 4 problems I just mentioned are remedied in Catholicism shows me that the RCC is the true church and validates the idea of the Bishop of Rome as having primacy The Catholic church has unanimous agreement on moral issues, well defined catechism, does so much good for others as an organization, a rich philosophical and mystical tradition, and has never appeared to me in its history to be so divided like I perceive the Orthodox.



What would you say I am not seeing? How can these issues I have with Orthodoxy be remedied? I want to follow the one true church and I believe that I am.

**HELP**
So I ran with my four children in the middle of the night to get away from my abusive husband. My friend picked us up and took us two hours and 45 mins away to her house to be safe. I have a preemie who is 7 pounds now ..a two year old...9 year old...and 12 year old. Apparently in the midst of grabbing everything from the house I forgot my wic Similac neosure for my baby and I just ran COMPLETELY out and no money to buy any and I honestly do not know what to do..I'm so scared. My friend who we moved in with is out of funds and I have no family. I called the pediatricians around here and none have any samples and hospital says they have a shortage for labor and delivery only right now. I am at a loss and so scared...anyone have any ideas because I'm out of all...oh the two local food banks here do not have ANY formula...idk I need prayers and help

I just want to give up but I know I can not do that because I am all that my four babies have. Especially now that I left and pretty much us 5 is all we have.. we have no other family and the only friend that we have is the one that is allowing us to live with her until we can get on our feet to get our own house. 

I just feel so hopeless and useless because I cannot even provide for my own children what kind of mother am I? Maybe I shouldn't have left or maybe I should go back and just deal with it for the well being of my children I do not know what to do or what to think I honestly just feel like a failure what I mean is I have failed as a mother... A wife..and  just a woman in general!! 

I CALLED SIMILAC AND THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME SOME FORMULA BUT IT TAKES AROUND 14 DAYS TO PROCESS THE ORDER THEN THEY SHIP IT OUT SO THE LADY ON THE PHONE SAID I CAN EXPECT IT AROUND 20 TO 30 DAYS OR A MONTH PRETTY MUCH. I ALSO CALLED WIC TWICE ACTUALLY, AND TALK TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND EXPLAINED MY SITUATION AND THEY CHECKED AND THEY HAVE NO SAMPLES OR EXTRAS OF ANY KIND OF FORMULA.  THEY GAVE ME THE SOONEST APPOINTMENT THEY COULD WHICH IS THIS COMING THURSDAY. BUT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING NOW BECAUSE WE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE SIMILAC NEOSURE NOW. I HAVE NONE TO GIVE MY SON SO I HAVE BEEN CALLING MESSAGING AND DOING EVERYTHING I CAN THINK OF TO AT LEAST COME UP WITH THE $24 TO BUY A CAN TO AT LEAST LAST TILL WIC APPOINTMENT THURSDAY. 

I HAD ASKED ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THE LOAN ME SOME MONEY OR TO EVEN SEND A VIRTUAL GIFT CARD AND I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT TRIPLE THE AMOUNT. WHICH PRETTY MUCH MEANS THAT FOR $25 I WAS OFFERING TO GIVE THEM $75 AND THE LAST 2 PEOPLE I ASKED I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK $100 FOR THE 25 AND NO SUCCESS YET BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP I HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT ASAP.

I feel like I'm slowly becoming a misanthrope,coolbutclueless,1592615440,"With everything going on in the past few months Ive really struggled with a generally distaste for other people. 

I try really hard in my life to remain calm and not be reactive. To not let a knee jerk reaction be my only reaction because its very rare that a knee jerk reaction is the correct one. Ive never really struggled with anger or angry out burst but I feel like I'm constantly sitting on a powder keg now. I really do hate some people, but specifically I hate the willfully ignorant, and if this year had a mascot that mascot would be willful ignorance. 

It started withe virus, people refuse to listen to anything they disagree with. They think that their opinions mean something. If your not a medical professional your opinion is worthless on medical issues, stay in your area of expertise and listen to what they expects are saying in areas you know nothing in. I'm consistently having to push down all of this anger to stay calm. Ive got friends that I can't speak to right now because if I speak to them I'm going to tell them how much of a selfish, ignorant, entitled idiot they are. I'll destroy that friendship if I talk with her right now (and this is someone I generally would spend several days a week hanging out with prior to the virus). 

There are many things in life we can agree to disagree on. There are somethings we DON'T get to disagree about: The earth is not flat, 2+2=4, and this virus is real and killing people. Anyone who disagree's with those statements is a special type of WILLFUL stupid. Ignorance doesn't anger me, WILLFUL ignorance does. 

Its not like I haven't listened to both sides. Ive listened to people explaining why mask don't do anything, Ive listened to people making (at times) compelling arguments about how the statistics are misleading. But there is a really obvious trend. The only people talking about reopening, the only people talking about how mask don't work? Yeah, those people arn't in the medical field. Aka, they are talking about things they don't know about. 

Its not just the virus. I saw a video of a cop beating a man who was on the ground, another cop coming over and placing a stick in the mans hand, and then him starting to beat the guy (who is face down on the ground) as well. Video after video of innocent people, who were not being violent, being violently attacked by the very people who are suppose to protect them. And then people have the gaul to defend their actions. I'm not a violent person, but if the people in some of these videos were people I knew, if it was someone I knew who was being abused in this way and got away with it without any justice OR mercy. I don't know if I could restrain myself from becoming a murder. If I knew those people personally this videos would break me. 

Then there are the church people. Who are to blinded by their own political ideologies, half of them seem like they WANT a bishop to be in herasy so they can scream and yell and point all their self righteous indignation at him. 

Ive spent YEARS where the fundamental focus of my life, the area Ive tried so hard to grow in, has been to not be like this. If I'm ignorant, I WANT to know the right thing. I have the burning desire to BE right, not to FEEL right. That means I actually listen. I'm not perfect, and I'm learning every day of some new thing I had understood wrongly, and I try to take that in stride. 

I am so full of anger. Angry at people for being idiots, for being selfish, and angry that in their selfishness they are activly trying to harm other people. Its one thing if you are ignorant to your own determinant, its another when your ignorant at the expense of another persons well being. I spend so much time lately trying to calm myself. Reminding myself NOT to villify or make sweeping statements. Not to think that every protestor is a looter or that every cop is corrupt, and I'm so....damn....tired. I'm exhausted from trying to keep myself in check.I'm exhausted trying to be understanding, I'm exhausted trying to respond rationally when people are being irrational and angry and violent. 

It would be SO EASY to take a side, do you have any idea? It would so easy to just, allow myself to think like everyone else. Let all the cops be horrible pigs I can hate, let the protestors all be horrible people who deserve to be abused, let the mask be an infringement on my freedom. It would be SO MUCH easier to just give in to all of this hate. It doesn't even matter what side, any side would be a weight of my shoulders. I spend so much energy pulling myself back from the extremes and the result is every side thinks I'm the enemy and treats me like one. 

I don't know what to do. My priest once told me to remember ""They know not what they do"" when I see these types of things. I don't know how to do that. I feel like if I take a step back and tell myself that then I'm being arrogant, and I am. I'm hugely arrogant as this entire post has probably made painfully clear. But if I take a step back and just assume that I've got it right and figured out and everyone else is just not as intelligent.... I don't think thats much better. To assume I'm above everyone, that i'm smarter than everyone and I have it all figured out while the plebs below me wallow in ignorance. If I have that view is it really any better than just hating everyone? 

What if I don't take that view? What if continue as I have been? well at this point I don't know of many people who I can actually respect. I don't have a shred of respect left for a few of my friends at this point. my opinion for people as a whole is continuing to drop.  I don't know what to do. I can't dignify absurdity by acting like these are reasonable views some people have, they arn't even well throught out. I'm perfectly capable of disagreeing with someone and still respecting their view because its well thought out. But thats not the case here. ITs just rampant emotionalism with no basis in reality at all. How would I live with myself if I acted like that was valid?

Tempted by relativism,Vasilisonofspiro,1592595245,"Hello there is a specific thought that’s been bothering. If Orthodoxy is truly the Truth and God desires us all to be saved how come not everyone comes to it spiritually or logically, there have been people much smarter and better than me who have most likely looked hard into Orthodoxy and rejected it for whatever reason, there are millions after millions of non orthodox people who devotedly believe they have the truth. There are many people who say nearly identical things as our converts do when asked why they joined such and such religion - I just felt the presence of God or I just new it was the truth or it was the only choice that made sense. I believe Orthodoxy is the truth and would never leave my beloved church, I am convinced In every regard spiritually historically and logically however what bothers me is the thought that perhaps this is all just due to my own subjective logic and preferences as others who are non orthodox have felt all these things. I hope I did not ramble too much I was just wondering if they were any of you out there who has felt similar things.

"The general resurrection, 1 Corinthians, Papias and the millenial kingdom",MarysDowry,1592590333,"This might be a fairly basic question, but its something I find intruiging.

In 1 Corinthians we get this verse:

""For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. **But each in turn**: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, **those who belong to him**. **Then the end will come**, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father""

I have seen some convincing arguments that the *'then the end will come'* would actually be more correct being rendered something like ""then the fulfilment"" or ""then the rest"". (it can mean completion, fulfilment, consumation etc)

Either way, Paul seems to be suggesting that there is not a general resurrection of all people at once, but that there are stages to the resurrection. First Christ, then those 'in christ', then later those others.

So my question is, how do Orthodox view the general resurrection? Is there a single event in where all are raised, or does it occur in stages as Paul seems to suggest?

While we're at it, this is probably a good time to ask a related question. Given that Christ eventually hands over the kingdom to the Father, what is the purpose of the phrase ""whos kingdom shall have no end"" in the creed? 

Papias very early on referred to a saying of the Lord about an earthly time where there will be a paradise on earth, he reffered to this as a literal millenium as described in revelation. This would seem to fit with Pauls thought here where he says that Christ must reign *until* he has achieved victory over all powers. 

""Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. *For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet*. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.""

The understanding that I think seems most sensible here is that Christ will come and bring about an earthly millenial reign, raising the saints to reign with him to subdue the oppressive powers, then non-saintly will be raised into the kingdom, then the process will be finalised with Christ subduing all creation under the Father. This would entail an understanding of a tiered/staged process of the general resurrection. 

I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this.",OrthodoxChristianity
Can Someone Explain,FreeKhajiit,1592587788,"Hi!

I've been going off and on the a Greek Orthodox Church prior to COVID-19, and even then trying to keep up with some services from other churches via Youtube and whatnot. I guess I'm looking for a mentor to help guide me through Orthodoxy.

I'm a bit hesitant to talk to the priest, as he almost seems skeptical of me being there, or always in too much of a hurry to really sit down and talk. I was considering the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, but even without COVID, that's a pretty significant drive for me to make. I guess my first question is, what can I do if I feel like my priest is a bit of jerk?

Can someone here explain Orthodoxy to me? I know some of the basic stuff like the disagreement over the Pope, ecumenical councils, the layout of the church, and that sort of stuff. 

How does Mass work for you guys? My church, for example, has a Saturday night Vespers, followed by Orthros and a Divine Liturgy the next morning. What do all of those mean, how are they done, and where does someone who doesn't speak a word of Greek fit in? 

On that note, why are Orthodox churches separated by country/language/ethnicity, even if from my understanding they're basically the same? Are there actual differences in practice and/or doctrine, and why isn't there just one Orthodox Church like there is for Catholics, or why don't they just use plain language like Protestants? 

Besides the Pope, what exactly makes you guys different from Catholics? What about Protestants? Evangelicals? And so on? 

What's the deal with icons, and the proper way to address them when entering church, (I've seen people kiss them, cross themselves, etc.), or the proper way to enter church in general? 

What about fasting? How do Orthodox people pray? I've heard of a Komboskini before, but how is it used, or say differ from a Rosary? 

When the priest does his prayers and stuff prior to the main sermon and communion, there's someone off to the side, (usually a woman, sometimes a man, in my church) saying things like, ""Lord have mercy,"" and other stuff in English and/or Greek. It's almost like they're.....singing? As someone who grew up largely nonreligious but went to Episcopal church as a kid, and even to a couple African-American churches, this is probably the most visibly different and strange thing for me. 

Who is this and what.....are they saying, and why? Why does so much of it seem repetitive, even from week to week? Do you guys do hymns at all, or is that actually what I'm looking at here? If so, why is your choir so small, or you don't have the congregation sing or play music or anything like most other churches?

Paranoia over whether it counts as a sin [NSFW],Thaddeus152,1592583465,"Hello, I have recently been dealing with whether or not I committed a sin unintentionally or not. This post is somewhat NSFW.


Over the past week I have been extremely paranoid about whether even simply touching my male organ to go to the bathroom or for hygiene purposes is committing the sin of masturbation.

I have been crippled with anxiety because I when I was washing my self I accidently gave myself an erection, nothing was done after the fact simply just prayed and tried to ignore it. 

Aa someome who struggled so long with that horrible sin of masturbation in the past, it always even bothers me when I randomly get erections when waking up or sleeping I'm certain positions. 


Can someone please help me understand whether this would be considered a sin? I don't want to confess that I committed masturbation without actually knowing if this even counts. What set this all off was reading in a confession guide said ""have you touched yourself in a lustful or passionate way that was pleasing or arousing"".

Orthodoxy and the integrity of Scripture,Nordrhein,1592575318,"Hello!

Ex-Catholic here. I'm in a bit of a study phase on Orthodoxy at the current point. I'm studying alot of Orthodox sources, especially as relates to  the scriptures. One thing I'm finding a lot of confusing information on is the general stance of Orthodoxy to the integrity of Scripture itself, both in Bibles that  are used in the larger Christian world (just as an example, say the Vulgate or the Douay Rheims) and specifically in Orthodoxy (the Septuagint and the OSB).

&amp;#x200B;

Today, there are a large amount of biblical scholars that argue that there are interpolations in the Bible (especially in the NT) that are not original to the texts that were added for various purposes, usually to promote a specific view. For example, a short list of such verses might include:

 

1. **Mark 16:9-20**
2. **John 7:53-8:11**
3. **John 21**
4. **Luke 22:17-21**
5. **Luke 22:43-44**
6. **1 John 5:7-8**

&amp;#x200B;

There are other instances where verses previously declared authentic in some Bible versions are now not seen as so (the Comma Johanneum in latin bibles springs immediately to mind).

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a specific Orthodox stance on this kind of scholarship, and what it may mean for the integrity of sacred scripture and early Christian belief?

My story,Rough_Total,1592509217,"Hello this is my testimony of faith.

I grew up in a home with a Christian mother and an agonist father. I believed in God. Until age 11 or 12 I mixed Christianity and wicca. It was that way until age 13 I abandoned God and went to a religion called shinto. That religion is the traditional religion of Japan. I worshipped the kami or spirits of that religion. I considered myself a daughter of amaterasu the sun kami. I later turned to homosexuality, atheistic satanism, later agonism. I was my own Goddess. I later broke up with my dating partner. I grew cold in my heart. Then on April 11th 10 45pm 2020 I was saved. I shed alot of tears that night. Soon I experienced demonic attacks. I prayed and went on. 

My introduction to orthodox. I was on a drive with my family and we drove past a church. I asked my father what type it was and he said it was orthodox but he didn't know what type. I felt God tell me to look into it. So I researched it the next day. I felt God call my to this faith. A few days later I joined this community.

I was experiencing the demonic attacks again a few nights ago. So I got a virtual exorcism and I felt better. Let share my experience. It was showing the manifestations of demonic possession. I closed my eyes and prayed to God for mercy when I finished I heard a demonic female voice saying ""Why is thou doing this to me if you stop I will give you things!"" I replied. ""You have no power over me I am no longer your slave in Jesus holy name I REBUKE you"" I heard a horrible shriek. When I opened my eyes I felt a light hand on my shoulder and a light hug around me. I was by myself in my room. I think that was my angel and Jesus. I felt love and peace. I no longer have demonic attacks or thoughts.

I am free from homosexuality. I am straight but a man is not the most important thing to me.

Looking for books similar to “Way of the Pilgrim”,greenmuhfuckingoblin,1592503783,"I wouldn’t consider myself Orthodox as I’ve never admittedly even been to an Orthodox Church. That said, a little over a year ago I found myself being pulled very strongly back into the faith by both spending time in the Scriptures as well as by applying the “Jesus prayer” to my life. I remember hearing about Way of the Pilgrim and picked it up last year and spent a lot of time reading it alongside the Scriptures and I must say that I found it to be a very touching and thought provoking book in regards to my faith. Ever since I’ve read that book I’ve found myself daily reciting the Jesus prayer internally. Some days more than others, but there’s no doubt to me that this prayer has both brought much inner peace to my life as well as sparked a strengthened zeal within me to grow closer to Our Heavenly Father through prayer, spending time in the Scriptures, and by working to strengthen my faith altogether. I was wondering if anybody knew any books that had similar themes to Way of the Pilgrim that they could recommend to me. Any help would be much appreciated!!",OrthodoxChristianity

Orthodox Christianity in the Netherlands?,CowdogHenk,1592489994,"Hi everyone, I am not a member of any Church but have been finding much nourishment and practice and joy in Orthodox writing and lectures, and I have been craving community and the presence of God in liturgy (of which I was profoundly struck the one time I visited an Orthodox parish in the States) and I would like to find a church.

I am an American living in the Holland, in Leiden, which makes for the happy situation that I am between several churches in Amsterdam, The Hague, and Rotterdam. My difficulty is that the diversity of available churches is sort of paralyzing. There is a Russian church in the Hague, with, I believe, services half in Dutch and half in English, and another in Amsterdam and in Rotterdam. There are Bulgarian, Serbian, Greek, Ethiopian Tewahedo and Coptic congregations. Services in Dutch I can follow.

In the States, there was always the OCA to be found amongst local Greek or Russian congregations where I was, though I was too shy to approach any of those as well. In principle, I would happily approach any of these churches I can only revere as an outsider, and I am too naive about the differences to have any scruples about the EO and OO differences that keep them from communing with one another, being more inclined to worship with anyone that, say, regards Isaac of Nineveh as a saint. I have heard very good things about the food and coffee at Ethiopian churches (this is just to say how naive about all this I am).

Are there any Dutch parishioners here? Awkwardly, I am plainly of white American upbringing (of Dutch descent) and I would not want, for example, to cause any offense by presuming I could enter the grounds of a parish that would be regarded as an ethnic refuge for those displaced from their original homes.

I don't know where to begin and know only that I am craving community, practice, and spiritual leadership. My apologies for writing so much and thank you so much in advance to anyone who might advise. God bless.",OrthodoxChristianity

I thank all of you who reply to my questions which may seem dumb.

I have one question. Should I list all my sins on a page if I go to confession? Did your priest demand that from you? To be honest I would like to do it but I have the fear that the priest will look bad at me after I confessed everything, but I also know that I should and must confess all sins without mercy, because I am a bigger sinner that the thief on the cross. I will also ask my priest, I am still waiting for an answer from him so I can ask further.

I beg you for your honest opinions.


If  there are some priests online I would be very thankful if you would also consider to answer me.

I don't want to live with my sins anymore, I want to be liked by our LORD and SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST. Because he died for all of us so we could live.

God has called us, not to the modern ""heaven"" of repose and sleep, but to the full and deifiying glory of the sons of God; and if we, whom our God thinks worthy to receive it, reject this call, --then better for us the flames of Hell, the torment of that last and awful proof of man's high calling and of God's unquenchable Love for all men, than the nothingness to which men of small faith, and the Nihilism of our age, aspire.

I mean as I said, I don't discriminate here, and based on what's happening in the world now it seems to me that by far the most suffering is experienced through animals, I mean it's no where even close, very few humans go through what tens of billions of animals go through every year, i mean I love how Christianity teaches about compassion, I'm all for compassion, but what does it mean to be compassionate?

I feel lied to: being in a 'fake' Orthodox relationship? Prayers &amp; guidance needed.,gutapple,1592308164,"I was with this man who I love very much. Been together for 5 years and he led me to Orthodoxy by talking about it and I decided to read more about it, watch YouTube videos on it, and made the decision to go to church and talk to a priest. It was not an easy thing to do being raised in a non-Christian household yet Orthodoxy was something that I have been looking for for years.. it was the missing piece of a puzzle in my life. I studied Catholicism for years, yet I was not as sure about conversion but I sure am after learning about Orthodoxy (not for him, but for myself)

I go to church most of the time, made friends, talked to people &amp; the priest. He has been to church 10x when we were together in 5 years and long distance relationship did not make it easy for the both of us. He would talk to the priest once and refuse to follow up and have a 1 to 1 talk with them.

I am not saying that I am better than him, I am just upset and heart broken by this. He told me he is Orthodox, that he calls himself Orthodox and joins these FB groups on Orthodoxy, gets involved with church politics but yet he does not know simple prayers such as the Jesus prayer or even Our Father. 

It is OK to not know these things however, for me, it is not OK to portray yourself as someone who knows it all and refuse to learn.

I would occasionally suggest some YouTube channels for him to watch (Fr Spyridon Bailey) or some podcasts on AFR where each episode lasts 2-10 mins depending on the topic and he shows no interest.

Orthodoxy sometimes causes me great anxiety.,Lord_Have_Mercy123,1592257652,"There are a few places where orthodoxy causes me great anxiety.

The first is the rather large anti ecumenist thought within orthodoxy. I live in a broadly secular, or religious state. The few Christian friends I have are protestant. The idea that all my protestant friends are going to hell because they aren’t Orthodox, and in a broader sense that the few remaining Christians are not “real Christians” just seems so.....depressing.

Also, there seems to be a very large “trad Orthodox” sentiment within orthodoxy. ie only the most pious and devout orthodox Christians are saved. I am so impious I fear for my salvation constantly. I don’t think I’ll ever live up to those standards and I am often captivated in angst.

Finally, the doctrine of not being able to speak definitively about the state of ones soul (ie damned or not damned) gives me incomprehensible fear. I understand the significance of sanctification being a process, but I just don’t understand the difference between theosis, sanctification, salvation and simply being “not damned”. The fact that the soul goes through a period of uncertainty after death terrifies me. The fact that my soul could very well be damned after I die is not something I can bear. It’s horrifying.

I don’t know what to do about this. I’ve spoken to me preist, who was very nice and helpful. He said to just take it slow. But this doesn’t get to heart of my anxiety. I fear I’ll go to hell. Please help.",OrthodoxChristianity

Really scared and anxious about not fitting in and leaving Catholicism,orthodoxinquirer1,1592249554,"

Hello everyone. For the last 3 months I’ve been studying Orthodoxy and really think I want to convert. The only thing is I’m an african american and the churches near me seem extremely ethnically based and have a lot of festivals and gatherings based off their ethnicities (greek, russian and indian) and I’m really worried I will not fit in at all. I’m also in an interracial relationship and I don’t know how people would feel about that. A lot of people in the tradcat realm that I come from were not okay with race mixing so i’m not sure how it would be for orthodoxy. 


I’m also really stressed about leaving Catholicism just because I have been so convinced my whole life that there’s no salvation outside of the Catholic church. I’m really scared I might be losing my salvation by doing this but it feels so right. Anyway thanks for reading this, any advice would be appreciated. Thanks a lot you guys",OrthodoxChristianity

Annoyance with Politics in Online Church Forum,basileus_altair,1592231718,My church has finally started to reopen but only for a limited amount of people. Our priest created a Realm online chat to post sign up sheets to attend services. I thought this was a great idea but then as I was reading through the posts I saw one by another member of our parish that was 100% political. It made me very angry to see a political post in a forum specifically for signing up for services not espousing political views. The person never mentioned anything about God/Christ or anything to do with Orthodoxy. I initially left the Methodist church because of the overtly political nature of the services and I hate to see it happen in the Orthodox church. This is more of a rant but I'd appreciate some insight on if I should say anything to my priest about political posts.,OrthodoxChristianity

Question for Serbian Orthodox,lovran20,1592180156,"A while ago I visited a Serbian Orthodox church while out of town, and read the intro and foreword to your [Divine Liturgy Service Book](https://store.ancientfaith.com/products/Divine-Liturgy-Service-Book.html). Something in it stood out to me at the time, but I can't remember exactly how it was phrased. If anyone has a copy of the service book, could you please find the quote for me? (I couldn't find a PDF of the book online, and the church I visited is 350 miles away so it's a little hard to go back and check the book myself lol.)

Basically what I read said something along the lines of, ""All the theology we believe is expressed in the liturgy, and if the theology someone teaches disagrees with the liturgy, the the theology in the liturgy trumps the other theology.""

What’s the problem that some people have with Kallistos Ware?,moderatefanatic,1592178128,"I’ll be honest, I don’t know him well but I’ve always heard his name spoken with respect. I’m cradle Orthodox (ROCOR) but my parents are converts after doing the SSPX Catholic thing in the 80s and 90s and his books were always on the book shelf and important to my dad. I was reading a discussion on a forum between a Catholic and an Orthodox Christian and someone said something along the lines of “using Kallistos Ware as an example of Orthodoxy is like using James Martin SJ as an example of Catholicism” if you didn’t know James Martin is a Jesuit who is a great example of the worst of the worst (or the best of the best) of the Novus Ordo Roman Church, a pantheist/quasi atheist who denies divine inspiration of the Bible, suggested that Saint Paul’s revelations were — if not totally made up — delusions brought on by epileptic fits and defends not only homosexual marriage but polyamory and pedophilia as a legitimate sexual preference and worst of all referred to our Lord and Saviour as nothing more than one of many apocalyptic preachers who were around in Roman Judea....needless to say that for anyone to be compared to that man is a bad thing and to compare Kallistos Ware to him carries the implication that at best Ware is a modernist who is in error and at worst is an out and out heretic, but I’ve never heard anything like that about him. If there is any credence to this comparison that’s a big problem since his books are given out to converts and potential converts as guidebooks to Orthodoxy. What’s up?",OrthodoxChristianity

Animal suffering and the problem of evil,MarysDowry,1592151291,"So I've posted before about the problem of evil, but I've never done one focused on the problem of animal suffering. So I am interested to hear how the Orthodox respond to this problem.

My view currently is that animal death pre-existed humanity, so therefore animals died before the fall. I think this is plainly obvious in the archaeological record, and the biblical texts seem to suggest such. 

Even in a 'traditional' understanding of this issue we still have to contend with a world in which God creates animals capable of unmerited suffering.

Given this problem, what is the Orthodox response?",OrthodoxChristianity
Atonement: The Humility of Jesus,TheLogosBecameFlesh,1592144376,"Because of Adam and Eve's sin, they became separated from God.  Instead of being humble to the Creator who created them and sustains their existence at every moment, they decided to disobey Him.  Therefore, God involuntarily humbled them.  They lost their dominion, immortality, and intimate union with God.

Jesus, who is the Word of God and above all, was fully obedient to God in His humanity, even unto death.  He knew that knowing God is our ultimate purpose in life, and finite things come and go.  Whether or not we have comfort, discomfort, pleasure, or suffering, we are to remain faithful to our ultimate purpose.  We don't love God only when He gives us things, but also when we don't have them, especially realizing this present age is temporary.  As Job states, ""And he said, 'Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.' In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong"" (Job 1:21-22).

Thus, because of Christ's obedience even unto death, He was resurrected and exalted in His humanity even higher than the original Adam was.  And since He is the Son of God and above all by nature, by faith in Him we can also partake in His glory.  He has the potential to represent everyone, being the second Adam who is far above the first.  ""For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died"" (2 Cor. 5:14).  Just as we are born in Adam and separated from God, we can also be reborn into Christ by faith and be intimately united to God, all because of Christ's humility which raised us all up with Him.

Adam's pride caused him to be involuntarily humbled.  Christ's voluntary humility caused Him to be exalted.  **""Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted"" (Matt. 23:12).**",OrthodoxChristianity

"I've gotten lost (obsessed) in religion, how do you get back to the God part?",LandofLemons,1592130382,"Hello! Hope you're all keeping well.

So I'm not going to give all the context, if you feel it's necessary to know exactly which religions/expressions I've been exploring I can list but won't go in depth about my level of research unless asked: Baha'i faith, Orthodox Catholic Church, Roman Catholic Church + Eastern rites, Assyrian Church of the East (brief), Oriental Orthodox (brief), Quakerism/Religious Society of Friends, LDS, Stone-campbell movement (attended at a stone-campbell church for a while, got rebaptised there. Long story.), Dutch Reformed (was raised in this church but never got confirmed due to being an atheist at the time), Sikhism, Jainism, Zarathustra, Taoism, some other high-demand groups out of interest, Anabaptist movement, Judaism (general), Islam (certain sects but mostly general), Lutheranism, Hinduism (generally brief but with regards to the 4 main sects), Buddhism (generally in the more ""ahh this is terrifying, why?"" realm. Rather than the ""palatable"" stuff western sources tend to portray. But I believe some ""crazy"" things myself, so who am I to judge another person's so-called ""crazy"". Never realised how politics infiltrated Buddhism. Super interesting stuff actually), shintoism, maybe other things I've left out. My main focus for the last 8 months has been Christianity but anyway.

So I'm only going to go into the Orthodox Catholic Church front, since it's relevant to this forum.
I've attended a couple of Lenten services (before lockdown in my country), and a couple of virtual prayer services and Divine liturgies the parish offers. I read a Catholic perspective book on the history of Catholicism and Orthodoxy, was pretty biased from what I could tell and was sort of inaccurate regarding Oriental Orthodoxy + the Assyrian Church of the East. I'm reading The Orthodox Way. Read the Wikipedia pages on some of this, I'm familiar with the schism, have read a bunch on OrthodoxWiki, have twice weekly virtual meetings with a priest at the parish I visited, am in contact with a priest from another parish, take weekly virtual Catechumenal classes, and became friends with a parishioner who has been so patient in answering my questions. Anyway, the priest is comfortable with me becoming a Catechumen whenever I'm ready.
But, when is someone ready to do that?

The Orthodox perspective has taken away much of my previously intense fear of being wrong + hell, and the idea that I must know everything about something to be worthy of participation in a relationship with God. I really love the way that the church seems to approach salvation and a relationship with God. I like the idea of essenses and energies. I'm so thankful for all that I've been able to learn so far!

 Here is my main question: I have become obsessed with religion, and being fully informed before making a choice. I will say the Orthodox perspectives I've encountered have enabled me to feel way more balanced in my exploration, and way less frantic. But I have allowed my relationship with God to backslide a ton in all this research. I pray only occasionally, and it's hard to do this-although I've had moments of connection. How do you regain the looking for God part, over the looking for information part?
I'm not only doing the research to be fully informed, but also because I genuinely love learning about how humans express their spirituality. And this is something that I hold dear.
But I think I've become clouded in this ""Search for truth"", I know we can only build up models of truth and that it's impossible to hold absolute truth. But I still feel afraid of making the wrong choice, and it doesn't feel like much of a choice anyway--since there are so many options that I won't regard most and can't be informed enough not to make a biased choice.
I know that this can be prideful, wanting to know exactly. But I really don't know how to let go. I used to think there was something wrong with me because I didn't believe in God. Now I wonder if there is something wrong with me because it's not clear which path to take. 

TLDR: obsessed with religions and different faith expressions, let the relationship with God part backslide. Had a question about being ready to be a catechumen in there somewhere. 
Any advice?",OrthodoxChristianity

I just watched my first Divine Liturgy,i_really_like_mario,1592111888,"Before going into it, I don't mean that I recorded my first Liturgy long ago and watched it again or something; I mean that I just watched a Divine Liturgy for the first time since I never went to one.

Today I sort of grew tired of simply hearing abou the beauty of the Eastern Church's tradition and decided to look up a Divine Liturgy stream on YouTube. I must say that I very much enjoyed it. There was a camera behind the iconostasis so I could watch what the priest (in this case bishop) was doing and thus felt more connected and concentrated (even though it was hard to tell what he was doing, it's still something!). Something that caught me off guard was that the beginning of the Liturgy was unusally long; it kind of felt like the chanting would never end, but I still liked it and the Liturgy paced consistently after that. Speaking of chanting, I love how a lot of the Liturgy is chanted. The homily was hard to keep up with because the bishop kept interchanging between Ukranian and English. There are also many other things which I am sure were symbollic, considering Eastern Church culture, but I'd rather ask at a later date. In general, the Liturgy was very pretty, and, don't tell my fellow Latin Catholics, I'd choose it over Mass any day! The Liturgy celebrated was the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom and in a Ukranian Catholic church if that is important. I'm glad to have this space to talk about this experience!",OrthodoxChristianity

Progress: I talked to two (Catholic and Orthodox) priests this week,Pau1DT,1592084405,"Here as an inquirer.

First I saw my spiritual director who is a former Benedictine monk and has been advising me for a while on preparing to become a monk myself. I decided to be honest to him and tell him that I was going to explore Orthodoxy seriously. He wasn't alarmed, but he did not understand how anyone can question the scriptures and history regarding Papal supremacy, or disavow the scholastic revolution in the Latin church, and says the schism and failed union of Florence was for political reasons anyway and the Filioque doesn't really matter. And because I didn't try to have a discussion about any of those points, the conversation turned out about how this whole thing is probably a temptation from the Devil to prevent me from entering monastic life, which I do think is possible.

Then today I went to the divine liturgy at the local Russian cathedral and was able to talk to an Orthodox priest briefly. I exposed my current situation to him. He said that it's good to want to give everything to God but only if you know that it's going to give you peace, and that it is important to take all the time you need to make a decision. He proposed that we meet again to talk about Orthodox spirituality.

On one hand I want to read as many books as possible so I can make an informed decision, yet on the other, the more I do, the more I realize how life-consuming and vain it all is. There is so much to sort out that no one can pretend to have found ""the Church"" without going where they ultimately believed God was calling them. But then what do you do when you've already joined a Church which threatens hell if you leave? What do you do when no one else around you feels the same way? It's not like God is going to call every person to a different denomination. And it's not like I deserve any special calling that others Catholics do not (that being said, I didn't deserve to find the faith either, yet I was gifted with faith).

Because of my readings, in accordance with my conscience, I haven't received Holy Communion in two weeks and I miss Christ so badly, although I pray more often than usual. But everytime I say ""Lord have mercy"" or everytime I look at Him, I feel like I am already judged and condemned.

"The Bible in a thousand words, any ideas to make it better?",digoryk,1592071864,"the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.

The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”

And the LORD God made a woman and brought her to the man. Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.

But the serpent said to the woman, “when you eat of the tree in the midst of the garden, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” So she took of its fruit and ate, and her husband who was with her ate.

The LORD God said to the serpent, “I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”

then the LORD God drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim to guard the way to the tree of life.

Thus sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned

“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Long ago, your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, and they served other gods. Then I chose your father Abraham.

And I swore to him “I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.”

I gave Isaac to Abraham. And to Isaac I gave Jacob but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.

LORD God, you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and you performed wonders against all the people of egypt and you came down and spoke with our fathers from heaven and gave them right rules and true laws, and you told them to go in to possess the land that you had sworn to give them.

Then they asked for a king, and God raised up David to be their king, and said, ‘David is a man after my heart, who will do all my will.

But after they had rest they did evil before you O God, they rebelled and killed your prophets, and committed great blasphemies. Nevertheless, you did not forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.

——————————————————

The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a virgin betrothed to a man of the house of David. And he said to her, “Greetings, O favored one, behold, you will bear a son and of his kingdom there will be no end.” And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; May it be to me according to your word.”

And so, from king David's offspring God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.

And Jesus taught “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. And You shall love your neighbor as yourself”

And to his disciples He said “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me”

But those who lived in Jerusalem condemned him and they asked to have him crucified.

Surely he has carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken by God, and afflicted. But he was crushed for our iniquities, and with his wounds we are healed.

And they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.

Women who had followed him did not find His body in the tomb. But two men in dazzling white stood by them and said, “Jesus is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.”

And Jesus came to the apostles and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go and make disciples of all nations, And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, that she might be holy and without blemish.

This mystery is profound “a man shall hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” and it refers to Christ and the church.

And so Christ nourishes and cherishes the church, because we are members of his body.

and now God has highly exalted him so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

I looked, and in heaven I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain. And those in heaven praised the lamb, saying, “Worthy are you for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.”

I saw fire from heaven and consume Satan and those he deceived, and the devil was thrown into the lake of fire where he will be tormented forever.

And I saw the holy city, coming down from God, prepared as a bride for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. They will be his people, and He will be their God and they will reign with Him forever and ever.",OrthodoxChristianity

Introduction to Orthodox Christianity,sandor_bronn,1591996195,"[https://orthodoxwiki.org/Introduction\_to\_Orthodox\_Christianity](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Introduction_to_Orthodox_Christianity)

 **Orthodox Christianity** is the life in faith of the [Orthodox Church](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Orthodox_Church), inseparable from that concrete, historic community and encompassing its entire way of life. The Orthodox Christian faith is that faith ""handed once to the saints"" ([Jude](https://orthodoxwiki.org/index.php?title=Book_of_Jude&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) 3), passed on in [Holy Tradition](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Holy_Tradition) to the [apostles](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Apostles) by [Jesus Christ](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Jesus_Christ), and then handed down from one generation to the next, without addition or subtraction.

The sole purpose of Orthodox Christianity is the salvation of every human person, uniting him to Christ in the Church, transforming him in holiness, and imparting eternal life. This is the Gospel, the good news, that Jesus is the Messiah, that he rose from the dead, and that we may be saved as a result.",OrthodoxChristianity

Here is why I think it is obligatory for a Christian man to have a beard.,SwedishMonotheist,1591986923,"Not all men can grow beards, but for those who can, for them I think it is obligatory.

Here is why I think so:

* God placed the beard on man.

* Jesus, who for Christians is the number one example of true righteousness, most likely had a full beard. Male Christians who are capable of doing so should honour him by growing their beards.

* The male prophets were all observant Jews and therefore they most likely had full beards. We are obliged to honour them as well.

* Scripture says that men must look like men. It also says that women must look like women. Having a beard as a man if one can grow one is a part of this distinction between the sexes.

* If a man shaves his face he defiles his body and his natural appearance. Tattooing and piercing defiles the body and is strongly forbidden. Similarly, shaving one’s beard of is a form of body defilement and therefore it is prohibited as well.",OrthodoxChristianity

Heterodoxy,sandor_bronn,1591986294,"***Heterodoxy***, as opposed to Orthodoxy, is the belief in something other (*hetera doksa or ετέρα δόξα*) than the Orthodox Christian faith. In some senses, it is synonymous with [*heresy*](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Heresy) in that it is a departure from Orthodoxy, but it is distinct in that *heresy* by definition technically includes a specific choice to embrace and teach heterodox [doctrine](https://orthodoxwiki.org/index.php?title=Doctrine&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1), usually accompanied by a formal [anathema](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Anathema) (condemnation) from a [synod](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Synod).

In the Roman Catholic tradition, heterodoxy is simply teaching which is considered questionable but not truly against the church. The Roman Catholics consider the Orthodox to be heterodox.

*Heterodoxy* may also be used to refer to all Christian confessions which are not the [Orthodox Church](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Orthodox_Church).

I want to be a better child of God.,Acerbicsam,1591948622,"It has been just 4 years since I began my not so steady walk with Jesus. At times I forget I believe, and others I believe I don't believe. However at the best of times I know I am in His hands and I believe I feel His love working through me. 

My biggest obstacles to loving like Jesus - and that is currently my highest goal - is my ego and self centered desires.

I find I want to be right when being wrong is more loving. I want to prove myself when letting others prove themselves would be the kindest thing to do. I want to talk when I should listen. 

I still get spoiled by anger at situations that, intellectually, I know are not in my control or for my concern. I have vengeful urges. I fail into lust. I am way to slow to pray. I am still lost to this material world.

Can a priest stop a service because of excessive disruptions by people attending the service?,Classic_Result,1591940330,"I know we laity can be as disorderly as a bunch of something typically characterized as disorderly. As adults, we're supposed to deal tolerantly with children, understandingly with old people, supportively with the infirm, etc. However, there are disruptions that can be fork-in-the-eye disruptive, particularly deliberate contradiction of Church teaching and practice by supposedly Orthodox people. Yeah there are times outsiders will try to disrupt services or even infiltrate the Church to change it, and that can overlap.

I've read horror stories of, in a Catholic church, feminists getting up and saying the prayers of the consecration with the priest, or someone will contradict the priest and say that EVERYONE is welcome for communion, not just Catholics. It's not like it's only Catholics this could happen for, which is why I refer to them. Or there was a YouTube video about a Catholic funeral made wonky by the funeral attendees' total unfamiliarity with Catholic practice.

With St. Benjamin of Petrograd, there was a case of Bolshevik soldiers coming into the church during a vigil, and one of the soldiers even went as far as to spit into the chalice. Only St. Benjamin's appeal to the congregation to be peaceful kept them from killing the soldiers, that the service would continue when they had left. In that case, it wasn't the congregation's fault.

In the face of sharp enough blasphemy and sacrilege from the congregation, it seems like the ultimate (but still non-violent) thing that a priest could do is to ""take the ball and go home"", so to speak.

Orthodox Missionary?,1001Trees,1591907292,"Hello I’m going to become a catechumen hopefully the Sunday after next. It’ll really depend on whether or not I can go to my Parrish considering the virus.

My question is, can I still do that as an Orthodox Christian? As I understand it, the Orthodox often translate from the Septuagint rather than the Hebrew text, but my proficiency is in Ancient Hebrew, not Koine Greek. In fact, I don’t know any Greek whatsoever. 

Is it too early to even be considering this? I know I’m not even a catechumen yet, and whether or not I can become an Orthodox missionary will have no bearing on me becoming Orthodox-I’m going to convert either way-but I really had my sights set on becoming a Bible translator.

I’m having trouble with some matters of faith and would greatly appreciate prayer and advice.,EMPEROR_JUSTINIAN_I,1591904682,"Long post, fair warning.  

In short, I’m scared as and of hell.  I have been officially Orthodox for about a year and a half, having been raised Protestant, but I have recently come to find certain issues that separate us from our Catholic brothers to be either negligible or, more concerning, to be in their favor.  Additionally, I am unfortunately currently away from my parish and will be for several months, and have no Orthodox churches nearby where I might be able to speak with a priest.  As a result, I’m asking you for help and advice.  

A certain saint, whose name escapes me, once said that we need not worry about the salvation of Protestants and Catholics, as well as those who have no way of hearing the truth, because they have a loving God the same as we do, and that He understands; however, if we abandon Orthodoxy, we are sure to go to hell.  I’m terrified that by becoming convinced by some Catholic arguments, I might be condemning myself.  I’m scared to death of being wrong.  

**Papal primacy/supremacy**

This is the most important issue.  

It seems as though most church fathers that wrote on the position of the Papacy suggest a sort of supremacy rather than a mere status of *primus inter pares*.  Furthermore, Joseph de Maistre makes the fairly convincing argument that the Pope is where the buck stops, the point of conclusion of ecclesiastical disputes; in addition, the Councils are a part of his power, not a contradiction of it, having a relationship like a king and his parliament.   I am concerned by our own rejection of various councils - how does that make us different than the Miaphysites, for instance, if we have the ability to accept or reject councils without a central authority to make that call?  

The frequent criticism of papal infallibility tends to reject that it has only twice ever been invoked, and those times were after periods of staunch asceticism and constant prayer; this seems to be a far cry from the common Orthodox and Protestant view of the Pope as a dictator who can arbitrarily change dogmas at a whim.  

**Ancestral/original sin**

This issue seems to be one principally of semantics.  The Catholic view of inherited original sin seems to be a metaphorical guilt rather than a true judicial guilt; consequently, this seems to be in harmony with Orthodox teachings.  I believe the Protestant views, particularly Reformed ones, are the problematic variant, not the Catholic one.  

**Filioque**

Ignoring the issue of whether or not the Pope had the authority to insert the *Filioque*, the issue seems to be a semantic one.  The Latin word translated “proceed” has the same connotations as its English equivalent, whereas the Greek text implies a double origin of the Holy Ghost.  Rome has taken the position of eliminating the *Filioque* when reciting the Creed in Greek; consequently, the semantics seems to be a nonissue compared to Papal authority.  

**Scholasticism/mysticism**

This seems to be an artificial controversy.  There are many great Catholic mystics and great Orthodox scholastics; until Fr. Florovsky’s time, most Orthodox clergy were taught scholastic theology as a norm, anyway.  Furthermore, the Eastern Catholics even accept Palamism as valid. 

**Purgatory**

It seems to me than many Orthodox already accept Purgatory, or something like it, as a manner of *Theologoumena.*  The infographic in [this post](https://reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/ghllqt/purgatory_infographic_let_me_know_what_you_think/) makes a compelling argument for those that do not accept the *Theologoumena*.

**Immaculate Conception**

This is an issue of both papal primacy and original sin; I don’t believe it bears individual treatment, so I’ve only listed it because it is often mentioned as a dividing factor.  

**Contradictions between churches under the guise of *Economia* etc**

Many Orthodox churches use the practice of *economia* to institute vastly different ethical practices.  This makes me wonder how much union we can truly claim to have and how much authority the churches can claim to have if they may make these orders binding only to those people who are in their jurisdiction.  For example, contraception is entirely disallowed in some jurisdictions and allowed in others, as is transgender identity, or various smaller issues.  

**Ecclesiology**

I find that Rome has said that the Orthodox churches are valid, whereas Orthodox churches disagree on the validity of Rome and her Apostolic Succession.  However, I don’t see how the largely political arguments of 1054 can control the Body of Christ, and we had a mutual link in Antioch until the eighteenth century, ended by the Melkite Schism.  This seems to me to contradict the Orthodox position. 

Additionally, I find the various churches’ submission to temporal states very worrying.  Muscovite publications frequently publish misinformation about the Ecumenical Patriarch and the Ukrainian church, and the Ecumenical Patriarch is required to be a citizen of a Muslim country, i.e. Turkey, and is thus under their secular control.  This makes me nervous about how free the Churches really are, and whether we might at any time see similar state infiltration of them as happened in the Soviet Union.  This is, of course, not exclusive to Orthodox churches, but their national alignments seems to make them more prone to outside control.  

**Conclusion** 

My apologies for the long post.  
I’m just really worried and scared.   I’m also mad at myself for getting thrown around by this stuff so easily.  I used to have issues with Protestant stuff before this, too, but I was able to overcome that with human and Divine help.  
Please help me out, and please pray for me.

Montenegrin police in Ulcinj have opened a criminal case against the Metropolis of Montenegro of the Serbian Orthodox Church and against His Eminence Metropolitan Amfilohije of Montenegro personally for the alleged uncoordinated construction of a monastery object, reports [RIA-Novosti](http://0s.ojuwcltsou.cmle.ru/20200611/1572810196.html).

The case refers to the monastic residence at St. Basil of Ostrog Monastery near Ulcinj, which [the authorities demolished yesterday](https://orthochristian.com/131769.html). The 18th-century Church of St. Basil was just [transferred to the status of a convent last month](https://orthochristian.com/130994.html), and the building was newly-constructed.

Met. Amfilohije referred to the act of destruction as an attack on the people and the Church and against St. Basil himself, highlighting that the destruction began just after the Church announced that it would resume its protest processions this coming Sunday.

After consulting with the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the police decided to open the case against the Metropolitan and Church for the “construction of an object without notification and permission.”

Montenegro's Fight Against St. Basil of Ostrog Continues...,sandor_bronn,1591812208,"[https://orthochristian.com/131769.html](https://orthochristian.com/131769.html)

The Montenegrin government’s war against the Orthodox Church, and against the beloved St. Basil of Ostrog himself, in the words of His Grace Bishop Joanikije of Budimlja and Nikšić, escalated this morning with a sudden act of demolition at the new Monastery of St. Basil near the southern coastal town of Ulcinj.

“This morning, they surrounded the guest house and started demolishing it, and the police aren’t allowing anyone to get near,” said one Ulcinj local, reports the site of the Metropolis of Montenegro of the [Serbian Orthodox Church](https://mitropolija.com/2020/06/10/rezimski-rat-protiv-svetog-vasilija-ostroskog-u-toku-je-rusenje-konaka-njegovog-manastira-kod-ulcinja/).

“It is indicative that this is happening after the Church’s decision to continue the protest processions,” reads the Church’s report.

Elder Paisios' Seven Tangerines,sandor_bronn,1591719899,"[Elder Paisios' Seven Tangerines](https://orthochristian.com/131714.html)

It was in February 1988. It was very cold in Karyes. It was high above sea level. The humidity usually hampered our movements. But now the weather was dry. The wind was blowing and it was enjoyable if you were suitably dressed. The evening was falling. The sun had just hid beyond the mountain. [Elder Paisios](http://orthochristian.com/105097.html) and I were walking along a path. We met Fr. Kallinikos from Koutlomousiou Skete on our way.

We were approaching the skete’s wooden bridge and were surrounded only by bare, lifeless hazel-trees with their bare branches.

“H’m. Who has brought me tangerines?” Elder Paisios wondered with surprise.

In the distance, over sixty-five yards away, we could make out the door of the elder’s kaliva in the yard, along with something red—or, to be more exact, something orange—hanging on the doorknob. We couldn’t see what exactly was hanging there because of the distance.

A little while later we approached the elder’s kaliva. In front of ourselves we indeed could see a large transparent, orange cellophane bag full of tangerines. How had he spotted them from so far away? How had he figured out that those were tangerines and not oranges, for example? After all, the bag was orange, and there could have been apples in it!

"Hosea 11:1, Matthew 2:15 and the Examination of the Prophecies by Thomas Paine",GloryToICXC,1591651177,"I was chrismated into the Church last Sunday, and I am happy about that! 

However, I still get great doubts. My doubts are not those typical atheist “if God real why people die?” 

However it’s more academic. I remembered reading Matthew 2:15 and it says Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of Hosea 11:1 of being called out of Egypt. However, Hosea 11:1 is not even a prophecy. Reading the entire chapter in context, “This passage, falsely called a prophecy of Christ, refers to the children of Israel coming out of Egypt in the time of Pharaoh, and to the idolatry they committed afterwards. To make it apply to Jesus Christ, he then must be the person who sacrificed unto Baalim and burnt incense to graven images; for the person called out of Egypt by the collective name, Israel, and the persons committing this idolatry, are the same persons, or the descendants of them. This then can be no prophecy of Jesus Christ, unless they are willing to make an idolator of him.” 

Thomas Paine’s critique further discusses Matthew and how Jesus, Mary, and Joseph go into Nazareth and they fulfill the prophecy of Jesus being “called a Nazarene.” That there is no such verse in the Old Testament saying the messiah will be called a Nazarene. This is supported by other scholars not being able to find an OT verse labeling the messiah as a Nazarene. 

How could Matthew do this? This inaccuracy by him takes away an immense amount of credibility from a divinely inspired saint and from the New Testament. It’s almost as if he took verses that sounded like a messiah and tried to fit it in to make it look like Jesus.",OrthodoxChristianity

A sobering thought for Pentecost (on E Orthodox unity in the USA),habit5820,1591579917,"Pentecost is usually a wonderful time, much like the Sunday of Orthodoxy, when we can celebrate unity between our various jurisdictions. The unity we share in being part of the one, united Eastern Orthodox Church.

But I feel like this particular Pentecost is showing how divided we are, not just in jurisdiction, but also in our worldview and values that govern our various communities. This is most evident in our responses to the Coronavirus crisis.

Today, many, if not most Greek Archdiocesan parishes throughout the United States have remained closed to public services; and maintain services only through online streaming. Some have begun small efforts of returning, but only in permitting some reservations on a per-service basis in order to maintain compliant capacity numbers and allow social distancing to be maintain.

As far as I’m aware, many OCA parishes are also doing likewise, maybe except doe the smallest communities.

I’ve noticed that parishes in other jurisdictions, most notably the Antiochian Archdiocese, Serbian Archdiocese and ROCOR, have already been making strides to bringing people back in church. Our local Serbian church has had public services for several weeks now; and the local Antiochian church has also had public services for some time, even sharing photos of having 40-50 people in church, more than half without any masks. The local ROCOR parish has isolated itself from most of the other parishes in town, so I can’t say what they are doing.

This is relevant to unity, because it not only shows the difference in how our hierarchs handle these things, but especially the local parishes and people. The early opening of some parishes has led directly to those parishes “poaching” the faithful of the nearby parishes which remain closed. Their numbers continue to swell, even way beyond the actual municipal and state guidelines for gatherings. None have said anything to dissuade anyone from coming, none have advised people to listen to their Priest or their Bishop’s guidance.

Why do I feel this is problematic? Because it seems to imply a lack of respect and authority to the Priests and Bishops of the other churches. In the GOA, for example, the Bishops have instructed GOA parishes to coordinate with one another and to commit to the same plans and efforts to reopen at the exact same times, and in accordance with local guidelines. In the GOA at least, this seems to be designed to help prevent “poaching” of one another’s communities and to help reopening be guided by caution and medical expertise.

I’ve seen many of our own parishioners who have begun to attend the couple churches that have already opened. Which is their own decision, but I’m saddened at the lack of deference and respect that the other Priests seem to have for our own Clergy’s authority and guidance. 

I do not see this system being condusive to a working united church in the USA. Even if we were under a single Bishop, there are significant disagreements that some of our clergy have with the decisions of Bishops and Priests of other jurisdictions; that I would imagine that some might well do their own thing. 

In a situation such as we are currently in, a parish like the GOA or OCA parishes which willingly stay closed, are under pressure to reopen prematurely because many of their people are attending other parishes. Or a parish which views the current situation in a different light may believe it is wrong to stay closed and want to reopen earlier than they are allowed by another Bishop.

I think this is a sobering reminder at how, while we are united under one communion, one faith; we are still divided by jurisdiction, and perhaps there is too much that still divides us from even jurisdictional unity.

RCIA equivalent?,My_Sleepy_Time,1591576832,"Hi. I’m looking into Orthodoxy.

It does seem that some Fathers rejected the use of images during worship. What does this mean? When searching out doctrines, I try to go the earliest we can. But when it comes to Icons, I'm theologically stumped because Fathers i go to for salvation/baptism etc here are rejecting the use of Icons. Does this mean that the ealry church rejected Icons, then later repented of this belief? Do later Fathers have the same Authority when making something a true teaching, how does this work?

As a roman catholic , there are exorcists who warn us never to confront or speak to demons and that there were priests who were lazy to confess their sins in preparation . At the exorcism , the demons announced the sins of the priest to everyone present. 

How is it that the protestants can cast out demons without such “side effects” when they have no confession , no valid eucharist , no holy water , no intercession of saints. They even speak and confront them which in my culture is forbidden .

Interesting thought from my son,HermanSmithScifi,1591498926,"My son is 6 and has been asking a lot lately about death and the afterlife.

One day he responded with ""oh, so when we die, we sink into our hearts, and that's how we go to Heaven.""

I feel like he has almost made a patristic-level comment. It feels like something you might read in a monk's wisdom. Perhaps it could be phrased as

&gt;As much as you prepare your heart as a home for the Holy Spirit, so will God prepare a home for you in Heaven.

(kind of polemical) Thoughts on the Christian understanding of hierarchy and spiritual fatherhood,Down_With_The_King,1591479580,"(Disclaimer: ""spiritual father"" and ""spiritual son"" could be swapped with ""spiritual mother"" and ""spiritual daughter"", I just used these to avoid repeating myself even more than I already do. By ""spiritual father"" I don't mean only ordained ones.)

The spiritual father is one who transmits everything that God transmitted to him. His tie to the Father is so strong that God truly speaks through him. He is transparent to God so that God speaks through him.

The spiritual son is one who receives everything that his spiritual father transmitted to him. Just as the spiritual father perfectly guides his spiritual son, the spiritual son perfectly obeys his spiritual father and keeps his word.

The spiritual father - spiritual son relationship is an image of the relationship between the Father and the Son. See these words of Christ from the Gospel of John:

&gt;Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods” ’? If He called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken), do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’? If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.

&gt;. . .

&gt;I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father’s name, they bear witness of Me. But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand. I and My Father are one.

&gt;. . .

&gt;He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him—the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day. For I have not spoken on My own authority; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak. And I know that His command is everlasting life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so I speak.

But every spiritual father is also truly a spiritual son to his own spiritual father. Jesus Christ, the Son, also becomes a father to His sons:

&gt;For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6, Hebrew)

&gt;I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word; that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me. And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me. (John 17:23)

&gt;Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you. (John 20:21)

&gt;He who hears you hears Me, he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me. (Luke 10:16)

This is the proper hierarchy: the Father Who perfectly communicates all things to the Son, and the Son Who perfectly obeys His Father and communicates all things to the apostles, and the apostles who perfectly obey the Son and communicate all things to their own spiritual sons, and so on. 

Each spiritual father is liable to the consistent doctrine that came before him, from the Father to his own spiritual father: this is Holy Tradition. Sadly, the reality of the situation is that there are so-called spiritual fathers who are disobedient to their own spiritual father, to their own Father. They cannot be a faithful son, so they cannot be a faithful father either. They claim to transmit the Holy Tradition, but truly, out of misguided intentions or even pride, they add their own content, their own interpretation. More maliciously, they might even remove parts of what they have received. They cannot say together with Christ ""not my will but yours"", they cannot say ""I only transmit what I have heard frorm my father"".

Such is the image of hierarchy in Orthodoxy: between myself and the Father, there are many links, forming a chain. Ideally, if these links are transparent, then I am truly united to the Father with and through them. It does not create separation, on the contrary, it establishes the intimacy of a family, and the ""distance"" of God's greatness and of the centuries separating me from the apostles becomes meaningless as I am joined to a completely transparent link that connects us all. But if a link becomes opaque, if it is its own ""self"" rather than a transparent link to the Father, then this link to the Father is harmed and the link must be either fixed or removed. If this does not happen, it will devolve into a lineage of opaque links, so-called spiritual fathers who do not transmit the ancient doctrine anymore and so-called spiritual sons who obey falsehood and are led astray.

The Catholic model of hierarchy is flawed. We know that the words of Christ were truly the Father's, not because He testified for Himself but because His Father's works evidently worked through Him, thus testifying for Him. He was transparent to the Father and this proved His eternal Sonship but also His authoritative spiritual fatherhood to the apostles. Even Christ was liable to His Father's doctrine, but because of His divinity and sinlessness He could not add to what He received nor could He fail to fulfill what the Father announced about Him. Liability is extremely important in the spiritual father - spiritual son relationship. But in Catholicism there is somebody who, under some circumstances, is not at risk of failing to obey what came before him: the Pope, under certain circumstances, can declare dogma infallibly and irreformably. Under these circumstances, he *cannot* be wrong nor can he be corrected. It's not organic: in the Orthodox (and biblical) model, his spiritual fatherhood, his authority, should be proven not by his own words, but by his total transparency to his own spiritual father, and overall to the whole of Holy Tradition up to what was transmitted to him. He must show himself a faithful spiritual son so he can be a trustworthy spiritual father. If he fails to do so, by teaching new things or removing things, he should be either corrected or removed by other contemporary fathers and by his own spiritual sons, who have access to the contents of Holy Tradition through those spiritual fathers who remained faithful and transparent, and also through the testimonies of the Church's practice and doctrine that were left to us: the ecclesiastical histories, the writings and lives of the saints, the acts of the councils... But Catholicism makes the Pope almost mechanically irreformable, not by ultimately proving his transparency and selflessness but by invoking his authority from Peter. In a sense it's to put the cart before the horses, as his spiritual fatherhood should be proven by his orthodoxy rather than his orthodoxy being proven by his spiritual fatherhood. In another sense it's to divinize the Pope, making him, under certain circumstances, absolutely above any judgment.

Protestant model of hierarchy is also flawed. The Protestants try to minimize hierarchy as much as possible. They try to have as few links as possible in the chain. Therefore there is no more necessary obedience to one's spiritual father, and there is no more spiritual fatherhood at all as private confession, monasticism, obedience to one's pastor even on uncomfortable topics, etc. are shunned. It's a real free-for-all. Generally the only recognized transparent link between man and Christ is the Bible, and every other authority (the Church Fathers, one's pastor, theologians, etc.) is only there as a suggestion that does not require serious obedience. This attack on hierarchy isn't just in the domain of spiritual fatherhood and sonship either. Everything that is perceived as standing between myself and God is to be eliminated or at least made optional: not just priests and spiritual fathers, but also sacraments, church buildings... But even for those who still see church buildings as important, the whole hierarchical structure of churches is gone: no more sanctuary with an altar, we don't want a tripartite church structure but a bipartite one at most... The hierarchy in marriage, where Christ is the head of man and man is the head of woman, is also gone and leaves room for same-sex marriage... Most gravely of all, though, is when some Protestants notice this pattern (perhaps unconsciously) and decide to remove the few ""orthodox"" chains that were left. Jesus is not God and not necessary, the Bible is full of mistakes and just a general guide... Finally, we see an evident result of removing as many links in the chain as possible: it does not respect the distance between man and God while removing the unnecessary stuff in between; it only destroys the distance between man and God. The almightiness and incomprehensibility of God is a concept that cannot stand, because by removing all the links God is simply ""reeled in"" and all reverence, even to suggested authorities like one's pastor, is gone. Certain basic concepts of classical theism can be lost. Bibles are just paper to be treated without reverence and churches are just building that are convenient. Pastors wear casual clothing.

Orthodox Christianity has preserved the ancient and biblical model of spiritual fatherhood and spiritual sonship, where a father's total transparency to one's own spiritual authorities makes one worthy of teaching and transmitting the tradition, and in response one shows complete obedience to this father. It is the ideal model but often doesn't work out perfectly, and that is why the already universally recognized tradition is often consulted (the Bible, the saints, the councils...). Furthermore, the ascetic practices of prayer, fasting... help cultivate the humility needed to be a faithful spiritual father or a faithful spiritual son. Catholicism and Protestantism, in contrast, have lost the proper understanding of Christian hierarchy, and therefore ecclesiology, together with a proper application of the method of Christianity.",OrthodoxChristianity

An Open Letter to My Brothers And Sisters,mimi_jean,1591474267,"Hello, 

This letter finds me in the midst of what I might consider to be one of the most difficult seasons of my adult life. Still, I am young, and expect more trials to come as is life’s way and the crosses we all bear as followers of our Lord. But this, this is truly atrocious. I pray that you will consider the best intentions and spirit behind my words, that I am pushing for peace between all men and Christ’s justice and message. I’ve said before my goal, and what should be the goal of all Christians I believe is the reconciliation of man to man and ultimately man to God. No less than this can achieve change and true peace--not one without conflict or tension against evil, nor one that confuses itself for inaction and silence, but one that can only exist with the presence of justice and God’s grace and truth which we should emulate through our own grace to one another. I hope we can all keep that mindset even as we dialogue, agree or disagree. 

George Floyd’s death is only one in a long and bloodsoaked line of police brutality incidents in the United States. He is not the first and I fear he will not be the last. The way this one man’s murder has created such division and unification is Biblical in nature from the sheer size of the movement to the way it has forced people from all walks of life to examine their hearts and choose their response. Let me make it clear, the systematic poverty, homelessness, and mass incarceration that plagues the black community is a result of racism and prejudice and on that point I cannot budge. You are either for us or against us, there is no room to not pick a side or speak up. I’ve said it before and I will reiterate: Silence is complicity. Only you can take a look at your own heart and see if you’re marching for freedom or only when it’s convenient. Its something that I’ve personally had to wrestle with and in part has caused my activism and this very letter to you all, my siblings in our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the last I’ll post majorly on it because then I’ll have said my peace. God forgive me if I scandalize any of you or lead you from our Lord with my words or the abrasiveness of the message that must be necessarily critical.

When I heard about the death of George Floyd and the ensuing protests and riots I was bereft. I felt as though the floor had fallen out from under me and the walls were caving in. Everything I knew about the trust that I had for Caesar crumbled to dust and I felt at once naked, alone, and desperately afraid for my family’s, friend’s, and my own lives. I remember sitting out on my porch at 3 AM near hyperventilating because I finally realized that this wasn’t just a one-off incident, this could happen to anyone. I wept and rested and awoke with a sudden fire in my spirit. I would never be able to forgive myself if I looked back in say 30 years time and reflected on how during this time I said or did nothing. So I contacted u/BibleIllustrated and when I learned he was making a video on the subject I asked to have a hand in it. We went over it again and again, did numerous revisions, and sent it off. I was hopeful and happy for the response from my fellow Orthodox expecting naively that although the secular world was divided, we would be able to pull together.

This was not the case.

I have received feedback from “Floyd deserved it, he was on drugs,” assuming that addiction is a simple issue, to, “Floyd’s death is too political we shouldn’t talk about it,” assuming that this is merely politics and a partisan issue and not a human rights crisis, and everything in between. My words have been twisted into like a skein of yarn to a tapestry full of read-in ideas and thoughts. It has not all been bad, however, I have had good come from those supporting my words and ideas and the support of my Spiritual Father whose opinion matters most to me as he is my soul’s shepherd. But the negativity had me floored.

On top of this, the response Archbishop Elpidophoros incurred was a mixed bag, mostly positive, but far too many calling His Eminence’s conviction fake whilst in the same breath praising the past actions of Archbishop Iakovos, or even throwing both out as too concerned with the secular affairs of modern society and engaging in some SJW hissy-fit. Even worse was the tone-deaf and callous appeal by Archbishop Peter, though I’ve formed a response to that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/gx62fk/appeal_of_archbishop_peter_of_chicago_midamerica/fszmvpb/) that you can feel free to read for more context. All of these factors, all of the anger and pain and unrighteousness has made it a necessity to make my own appeal to you all and to every Orthodox Christian who comes across this letter: We have a moral imperative to shine the light of Jesus Christ from the hill of our Church in support of peaceful but decisive and swift action in this time of civil unrest.

You and I do not have the luxury of silence. As long as there are black Orthodox Christians in America, this will never *ever* just be a secular issue. You have an imperative to be your brother’s keeper lest their blood cry from the Earth toward God Himself. This is not partisan, this is not muddy, this is black and white and we must make an effort to call out racism, ethno-fascism, phyletism, and tribalism wherever and whenever we see it within our Church. I am imploring you not to turn a blind eye and to speak out against these sins while still pushing to love the sinner with all of your strength and pray fervently for their repentance. It is not easy, the right thing almost never is, but it is necessary lest we in the end hear our Lord ask “Where were you when I couldn’t breathe?” 

**I am not, have not, and will not ever advocate for violence.** Love is  the only weapon of our warfare against hatred. Nothing else may be used because nothing else is effective in the destruction of injustice and sin. I personally do not care if BLM is in support of the LGBTQ+ community (and this is not something I am going to argue with you in the comments about because it is *so* besides the issue) but if you do care, fine, there are a million other organizations you can put your voice and support behind--within the Church even through the Brotherhood of Saint Moses the Black. Protest peacefully, organize a march, write an essay or comment but *do something*. We cannot afford to stand by as hundreds of black and brown lives are taken senselessly in the name of the god of this world when we are in such a unique and blessed position as Orthodox Christian. Light is the best disinfectant and we need to clean house. 

Our lives are precious and we possess the same image of the Triune God as anyone else, skin color irregardless. Am I not a woman and a sister? Was George Floyd, Ahmed Arbery, and countless others not also men and brothers worthy of respect and the right to live peacefully without fear of death for something they cannot change? Ask yourselves these questions. Really wrestle with them and examine your own heart as I will do so to mine. Wrestle with your shock, your discomfort, and your biases but do so urgently. This is bigger than George Floyd (in fact, peaceful protestors or being shot or strangled in the street), this is for the salvation of our nation and is in the name of justice itself.

Again, I pray that you’ll carefully consider my words and have patience with me if I’ve misspoken anywhere. I genuinely love each and every one of you and I hope that you can receive that through this letter. Please pray for me, the sinner.

What do you do when you have grown cold and disillusioned? Are you simply damned?,jarviez,1591469109,"The question may, for some of you, indicate a profound lack of faith on my part, and maybe it does, but I think it is a puzzle that deserves consideration. I have no one to really talk to about these issues. 

On some level, I wish that I was an Atheist. 

Before jumping to conclusions please let me explain. 

As far as I can remember I have always ""believed"" in God, or at least the concept of him. It may have been my upbringing but a belief in Christ, was also essential to me. Weather or not its good to go about looking for ""proofs"" for faith, I remember as a young man thinking of the conversion of Saul/Paul as all the proof I would ever need. It appears that he had much to gain from the world in by continuing his persecution of the church and his conversion seems only explainable within the context of a real encounter with God in the form of the risen Christ.  This is ironic because Paul's own teachings of love, and disinterested love, are the most alien to my own inclination and capabilities.    
I have at times questioned the veracity of my own belief on the grounds that ""if I truly 'believed' then I wouldn't knowingly commit sins,"" and there have been many. This reasoning leads to a very dark place because, when applied to the whole of humanity (who all sin), it makes all those who profess belief into liars. 

And so it seems to me that I am a man who professes belief, but lacks faith, hope, and love   
(for people, for God, and even himself).    
Regardless of weather this ""belief"" is or isn't a ""lie"", this seems like a path towards damnation. 

Alternatively, If I was truly an Atheist, I could at least say that I came by my damnation honestly, out of a real dis-belief, and with less pain and anguish within this life at least. But I'm not an Atheist, as much as it might be preferable to be one.  I do believe, and so I am stuck as a ""Christian"" who seems to be very much damned for his lack of love. 

It's as if, when I converted to the Orthodox faith, I stepped into some greek tragedy.   
The answer for me should be to try to acquire disinterested love, but seems to me to be an impossibility. 

I see why the Holy Fathers warn against despair. At this point, I don't think there is much to be done.

The Church is the true multi-ethnic society,Kinda-Professional,1591359249,"&gt;**A person who thinks that ethnic conflict is an inevitable feature of any multi-ethnic society?**

In a Secular society, that seems to be the case. Any cursory look at a high school cafeteria will show you how ethnicities/subcultures self-segregate themselves.

But, I digress. Only in an Orthodox Christian society can we truly accomplish a multi-ethnic society in which all are One in Christ. Amin.

But, America is a nation in which the ""Invisible Church"" doctrine is prevalent, so not all can be united in One. To think that a Secular society can will itself to become One is ludicrous. Otherwise, why would Jesus Christ need be born if He isn't the Truth?

About heart prayer,RepresentativeOne507,1591314512,"Hi,

I'm Roman Catholic and I'm discovering Orthodox spirituality, Jesus Prayer specifically.

It looks like there is a consensus that some specific techniques associated with this prayer are no to be used unless you got a spiritual director to talk about it.

I discovered in The Way Of A Pilgrim the idea that during prayer you should try to find the Place of the Heart, to ""focus"" on it and to put you mind in it, so to speak. I saw on this subreddit that it is easy to mess up with this, as it can uncover unhealthy spiritual/psychological or even carnal motions hidden in the heart and therefore be dangerous. However, I don't see why it should be considered as something more dangerous than, for example, spending as a lot of time in silence (outside and inside the mind): that too can uncover as much hard stuff to deal with, I guess. If it wasn't the case, monks wouldn't have huge spiritual fights.

So is it that dangerous? Is it something that I could try by myself (along with a good sacramental life)? Is there any easy to read ressources to help in that case?

I do not have any spiritual director now (but I intend to get one), and in any case, it's unlikely that he will know well the hesychast tradition. But I am following a psychotherapy, so I suppose it can help with psychological issues. In fact, I would like to mix my practice of the Jesus Prayer with this technique of entering the heart to make progress in both my spiritual life and my therapy.

A last point: I can very curious about spiritual gift, charisms, miracles and the like. I know this is not something to pursue and am willing to fight this tendency, but can it become problematic with this type of prayer?

Thanks for your answers!",OrthodoxChristianity
Exploring the Orthodox Church,RSMBrown,1591314130,"Hey All, 

I am an evangelical Christian (baptist), who has, for a number of years, felt called to look into or explore the Orthodox faith. I've never been to a service, and don't know much about the tenets of the faith beyond some of the basics I've read online. I think my curiosity comes from a combination of a sense of unfulfillment with my current Church/faith, and a little bit of exploration into other sects of Christianity when I attended Catholic high school - it was my first true exposure to a different kind of Christianity.  I'm not ready to say if conversion is in my future, but I feel the need to find out. 

What would you suggest I read to learn more about the eastern Orthodox Church? I welcome any and all suggestions. I'm in the Washington D.C. area, so I'm hoping to find a church and community in there area that would welcome a respectfully curious woman to learn more and observe if possible.

Existentialism Issues Causing Doubt,Jumpout,1591303745,"Hi, fellow Orthodox bros. Recently(being 1-2 years), I’ve become more existentialist and have had active existential crises’s at least once every other week. All this has led me to disbelief in not just my own religion of Greek Orthodoxy but religion as a whole. 

Questions like, how can God be all knowing, all good and all powerful at the same time? If God allowed/allows bad things to happen, one of those things just couldn’t be true, no? There’s many more but I’m sure you see my point here.

But, the other night, I had a dream where I was talking to someone about my religion. They asked me why I no longer believe and my dream-self responded “I chose not to”
They then asked me why I chose not to, to which my dream-self responded “it wasn’t a choice”. It was a very real-feeling dream and I’m pretty sure something else was said after that but I cannot recall, but I feel it may be a wake-up call which is why I’m posting here.

Is there anyone who has had similar struggles with their beliefs and/or how I can fight these issues that are causing me to disbelieve? I just find it hard that 5 years ago, I wanted to pursue Priesthood and now I find it hard to believe.",OrthodoxChristianity

Doctor-Priests of the Roman Empire,GrandDukeNotaras,1591228627," ""Greek Christian inscriptions from around the \[Roman\] empire indicate that it was not uncommon for priests and deacons to practice medicine. Thus, at Rome during the third century, when Greek Christians still dominated the church there, a priest named Dionysios served also as a physician. In the early fourth century, an illustrious priest of the Sidon church by the name of Zenobios won renown as a doctor. In 305 the Christian physician Theodotos came to the episcopal throne of Laodicea in Syria. At least one source describes as a doctor Basil, Bishop of Ankyra, a key figure in ecclesiastical politics during the fourth century.  


These doctor-clerics seem to have won great popularity with the faithful in eastern churches. Though only a priest, Zenobios of Sidon was persecuted together with other leaders of the Eastern Church. At the close of the fourth century a Greek physician by the name of Gerantios was consecrated bishop of Nikomedia. His unselfish practice of medicine while holding the episcopal office won him such popularity among the people of his flock that they fiercely defended him against the attempts of Bishop Nektarios of Constantinople to depose him.""  
\- The Birth of the Hospital in the Byzantine Empire, pg 57  


The chapter follows with a section about the Cappadocian fathers and how they had close connections with physicians. Gregory of Nazianzus' younger brother Kaisarios was a professional physician who had studied at Alexandria. He became an ""archiatros"" that is to say, ""head doctor"" in Constantinople. Basil himself studied medicine while in Athens and used it to treat his flock in Caesaria, Gergory of Nyssa had a close connection with the physician Eustathios.   
Priest clerics mentioned from later centuries include patriarch Photios of Constantinople and 12th century bishop John of Pisidrianai.  
It seems that after an order by the patriach Lukas Chrysoberges forbidding priests to become doctors, the instances of 'priest-clerics' becomes quite rare.",OrthodoxChristianity

I feel a calling to be Christian, specifically Eastern Orthodox. But I felt ostracized by members of The Church that told me I can’t be Christian and continue my sins unrepentantly.

Our relationship wouldn’t work with abstaining until marriage. My job isn’t ideal and I would like a better one. I was told if I continue my sins I couldn’t call myself a Christian, and that God can’t forgive some sins and not others because the state of grace can only exist where there is no sin in the soul. That was from the Roman Catholic Catechism. 

Am I still able to call myself a Christian even if I am doing these sins continually or not? Because a part of me really wants to be, I want to talk to God and share in God’s love. So badly. But I feel like I can’t because the way my life is. What are your thoughts?",OrthodoxChristianity

Wherefore in our habitation God truly dwells in us. How?

Protestant Considering EO - Many Questions,Mike_DT,1591156155,"Hello all!

I've lived most of my life as a Protestant but have been considering EO because of how similar it looks to the early church in contrast to the Protestant denominations I have been part of. I have a lot of questions, so I was thinking it would be a good idea to find a local a perish and check it out. However, it's difficult with COVID... so I'm turning to Reddit instead... gulp. ;)

I don't know if this is an odd thing to ask (and I swear I don't mean anything antagonistic about it), but for those of you who are familiar with Protestantism, what are the weirdest things I would need to wrestle with if I became EO? I'm asking now so that I can do some preliminary research and talk to a local Perish. I'm a fairly academically-oriented guy who has studied a lot of church history, so I'd prefer to just get hit with the hardest stuff in the beginning instead of being surprised later.

For example, I just learned the other day about the concept of an Aerial Toll-House? I'm told that this isn't a dogma, but some online sources make it sound like it is pretty important to believe it.

Or on a slightly less weird but equally controversial note, what about belief in the sinlessness of Mary (defined as believing that Mary went her whole life without committing any sin, intentional or unintentional)? It sounds like patristic sources like Chysostom may have believed that Mary sinned, and I'm not sure if this is actually a dogma or not. Even if it's not \*officially\* one, it strikes me that it kind of is in practice/the liturgy... is that right?

The brother therefore departed and obtained his release from his companions, as the old man had told him, and then he came to him. And the old man said to him, 'Go into your cell and keep Pentecost, and you will eat dry bread and salt only once a day, and after you have done this I will tell you something else to do later on'; and he went and did as the old man had told him, and then came to him again. Now when the old man saw that he was one who worked with his hands, he showed him the proper way to live in his cell; and the brother went to his cell, and fell on his face upon the ground, and for three whole days and nights he wept before God. And after these things, when his thoughts were saying to him, 'You are now an exalted person, and you have become a great man.' He used to contradict them, and set before his eyes his former shortcomings, and say, 'Thus were all your offences.' And again, when they used to say to him, ' you have performed many things negligently,' he would say, 'Nevertheless I do small services for God, and He shows His mercy upon me.' And when by such means as these the spirits had been overcome, they appeared to him in the form of corporeal creatures, and said to him, ' We have been vanquished by you'; and he said to them, 'Why?' and they said to him, ' If we humble you, we are raised up by you to an exalted position, and if we exalt you we are accounted by you for humility.'",OrthodoxChristianity

"ex-catholics, when did you stop confessing/receiving the eucharist?",Pau1DT,1591046015,"I came from atheism back to the Catholic Church (SSPX at first) two years ago without having considered anything else, because that's where I was born into and I was impressed by discovering the Tridentine rite. Though as soon as I confessed my inquiring into Orthodoxy to my SSPX priests they were pretty hostile and that really left a mark on me.

Fast forward to the pandemic lockdown this April, I had the immense grace to be stuck in a Benedictine monastery for two months. It allowed me among other things to realize that my love for Orthodoxy would not leave me in peace until I stopped forcing myself to take the catholic side for granted and staying in willful ignorance.

I told the priest-monk that my conscience was compelling me to entertain voluntary doubts about the dogma of papal infallibility and asked him if that would bar me from receiving the sacraments. He said no, be at peace and remember that praying must come before researching. That did help me a lot, but that's not the answer I would have been given by the SSPX priests before.

Although I have little experience with the Orthodox life beyond reading books, I already know where this is going, this doesn't go away confession after confession and cannot be pinpointed on anything, be it the dogmatic argument, the historical argument, the aesthetic appeal, whatever. Eastern Catholicism would only be a temporary solution. Archimandrite Lev Gillet said it best:

*""I find \[in Orthodoxy\] the image of Christ being less intercepted by superfluities of all kinds, and without the hierarchy and juridism placing a kind of screen between the Saviour and the souls. \[...\] My spiritual life blossoms more fully and freely in the Orthodox Church. Every encounter with Orthodoxy seems to make it warmer and brighter. And here is the heart of the process that is operating in me. At bottom, it is not this or that particular reason that draws me to Orthodoxy ; the real reason is so profound that it sort of erases all the particular reasons and renders them unreachable.""*

I love God and try to please Him best I can in everything I do, to the point where I want to become a monk, and it pains me that according to Catholic doctrine which I am compelled to believe in, I am in the process of separating myself from Him. The more I inquire, the more I feel like a liar everytime I go to communion and praying is becoming harder and harder. Sooner or later I am going to have to be honest to my spiritual father who is one of the priests at my parish, and I don't know what he will decide. Especially since I told him before that my doubts were resolved even though deep down they were not, and that I planned to enter a Benedictine monastery before September.

So how did you, ex-catholics, deal with the inner and outer struggle of gradually moving towards Orthodoxy while still receiving Catholic sacraments ? Thanks for your time reading anyway, God bless you.",OrthodoxChristianity
Anyone here extremely familiar with the works of St. John Chrysostom?,versorverbi,1591045321,"I'm working on a translation of Cornelius a Lapide's commentary on Romans, which opens with a commentary on all of Paul's Epistles, which *itself* opens with Lapide talking about how great Paul is. In this section, when talking about how some say that Paul has a great depth of wisdom (abyssus sapientiae), he cites St. John Chrysostom's fourth homily from *De Laudes Sancti Pauli Apostoli* as saying:

&gt; Paulus archetypus bonorum, cui omnem praedicationem, res orbis, mysteria cuncta universamque dispensationem Deus concessit. Ipse caelum solem habens justitiae, ipse mare sapientiae purissimum et profundissimum.

Of which my first-draft translation is:

&gt; Paul is the archetype of good [men], to whom God granted every pronouncement, [every] matter of the world, all mysteries, and universal stewardship. He himself hold[s] heaven [and] the sun of justice, he himself [holds] the purest and deepest sea of wisdom.

The problem is that this quote, as nearly as I can tell, isn't in Chrysostom's fourth homily in praise of St. Paul, nor in any of the homilies on that subject. Nor, in fact, anywhere that I've been able to find. By scattershot translation and Googling, I *did* see that Chrysostom frequently praises Paul's wisdom in many places, including paragraph 13 of Περὶ Παρθενίας (*De Virginitate*, ""On Virginity""), where he uses the phrase ""the depth of Paul's wisdom"" (τὸ βάθος τῆς σοφίας ... τοῦ Παύλου), but the context isn't this quote at all, or even remotely like it.

Searches for the Latin in particular bring up a bunch of contemporary and subsequent publications that cite the same homily... in the midst of a bunch of citations that mimic the order and context in Lapide, meaning other people got this maybe-error from him and he doesn't seem to have pulled it from anyone else. It also suggests to me that he pulled this quote from Chrysostom's Greek and translated it himself, since it doesn't seem to appear in Latin texts elsewhere (at least not before publication of his commentary).

It's also possible that Lapide is misattributing it entirely and even the Chrysostom link is incorrect, in which case, I'll just leave it at, more or less, ""who knows?"" in the footnote. But I'd like to find it if I can.

I have an  Orthodox Bible and began reading  ""The Orthodox Way"" for me Orthodoxy  feels more in line with what my spiritual beliefs have always been but  never embraced because of Protestantism. The only thing I am confused on  is the Church's view on childless couples. From what I can ascertain  the view is simply Marriage=Children but I keep finding  conflicted answers on this subject. The common answers seem to be very  dogmatic, neutral or simply ""Speak with a priest"". My question is  hypothetically if I was married and open to having children but my  spouse and I decided to wait until we are financially able to support a  child or simply felt called to serve God in another form what is the  general stance on that?. For the record I do not dislike kids nor am I  totally closed to the idea of them. I just believe there is more to a  marriage than simply breeding and couples should grow in the first few  years of their marriage together and I have met a lot of couples who are  childless and are doing God's work. My question to put it simply is are  Children mandated regardless of the situation by the Church?

How to help people who see Orthodoxy in a very negative light?,Down_With_The_King,1590922316,"The title is vague so let me elaborate.

My mother has expressed to me several times that she dislikes Orthodoxy. She says we are too strict and rule-based, with how we say we need to follow such and such prayers, and so on. She says we are as unwelcoming and racist as Catholics and Protestants, which is true (once we even got bullied out of the agape meal at a monastery by the worshippers there, and often people look at my mother strangely and become rude toward her upon learning that she's Algerian or she's not baptized). She says we act like a cult, as we say one should go to church and be baptized and receive communion and confess to a priest (this part in particular is extremely disturbing to her, she is convinced it is to control and blackmail people)... Because of all of this she has started seeing me in a very negative light as well, as she thinks I have been indoctrinated by people and she constantly thinks I'm trying to indoctrinate her too. As she says, her Church is in her heart and what Orthodoxy teaches does not fit her experience of God. After over a year of going to church with me (by her own will), her view of Christianity and of Christians has become extremely negative.

I am not saying all this to attack my mother, especially not to attack her in public. I know it is entirely my fault - if I were an actually decent example of a Christian, the light of Christ would shine through me and others around me would see what I saw which made me convert years ago. If nobody I know has found Orthodoxy attractive at all, it is my responsibility and my fault and I will be judged for it.

But... beside trying myself to be a better Christian, and more importantly praying our Lord that He brings all to Himself, what could I do to help my mother see Orthodoxy in a better light?

Question on validity of non-trinitarian sacraments,consideringcatholic,1590920259,"I had a question about the validity of non-trinitarian sacraments, such as by the Arians, that I asked on the subreddit for Catholicism but I thought that the question could also probably be asked here. I put the question below.
Because to my knowledge this group doesn't really exist today this is mainly a historical question. My understanding is that Catholicism says that Protestant baptisms are valid because they use a trinitarian formula but that non-Trinitarian baptisms (such as those found amongst Jehovah's Witnesses) are not valid because they do not have a trinitarian formula. It is my understanding Constantine was baptized on his death bed by an Arian bishop, who likely would not have used a trinitarian formula. Since Constantine is a Saint and generally you are required to have been baptized to go to heaven, does that mean that a non-trinitarian baptism is sometimes valid? Would it have been valid in the case of Constantine because the Arians had valid Apostolic Succession?",OrthodoxChristianity

Property Damage from a Christian Perspective,krillyboy,1590894119,"First off, mods, I won't feel any offense if you choose to take this down. I'm only an inquirer, not a theologian, and I'm sure this is going to be touchy. Please do what you think is right.

I've seen a lot of people get really riled up over the amount of property damage that has been happening in the wake of protests and riots in the past few days. I had a very quick reaction to it: this is morally wrong and should stop. I haven't completely abandoned that attitude, but as I've considered it and listened to more sources, my immediate assumptions have changed.

I will never stop condemning those who are destroying local and small businesses. There is nothing to be gained there. It is quite literally only bringing damage to the local community. And, deontologically speaking, the looting and property destruction are morally bad. On the other hand, people who are more angry over the property damage than the killing of an innocent man have their priorities all wrong.

One story from the life of Christ comes to mind when this is discussed. When the Lord saw that the Temple, dedicated to His Father, was being defiled by greed, corruption, and injustice, He dismantled their stations and impeded their ability to continue dealing in sin with the people in the face of God. I see similarities between this and the burning and destruction of the Minneapolis Target and the police stations. The Target in question has a history of direct support to the police, as well as disallowing protesters to buy crucial supplies such as milk - used to diminish the effects of pepper spray and tear gas. So what is the response of the protestors? Dismantle the support of the police, and dismantle the place where they meet and organize. Dismantle their stations and impede their ability to continue dealing in sin with the people in the face of God.

I don't want to defend theft or violence. The Lord teaches us not to repay sin with sin. But why should I care about the fate of a fully-insured branch of a multi-billion dollar corporation, or the meeting place of an institution which has proved to be not much more than a harbinger of destruction and and death, over the life of an innocent man, given no one is harmed?

Orthodox Youth Programs,retrogamer_wv,1590806786,"It’s been close to a year and half since I was blessed enough to find myself visiting the Church for the first time, and there’s a question that’s been weighing on my mind recently. Are there any robust youth programs within any of the Orthodox jurisdictions in North America?

My parish is Antiochian, and while I know there are things like SOYO and OCF, I haven’t really seen anything tailored to younger folks. I ask because I’m a teacher and scout leader, and I see this as an area I could contribute to once I’m received fully into the Church. To give you an idea of what I’m talking about when I say “robust” (since that can be a loaded word), I’m referring to a program that is semi-standardized with materials that adults could use across their various parishes to help cradles and young converts.

See, as a scout leader, we do this thing sometimes where we task our kids with learning about A, B, and C... but they have to a little presentation to their families, or have mom and dad help them research, or work with their parents to come up with a plan for doing something about it. It’s done on purpose (like working with your parents on a safety plan for the house... so the family is ultimately safer). I was recently listening to a priest discuss how poorly catechized many Orthodox adults are, and a youth program like this could have catechizing the whole family as an underlying motive. It had the potential to inoculate against times in their lives where they’re challenged on things about the faith that may cause them to abandoned it, while also strengthening their bonds to their parish and fellow believers.

Aren't aerial toll houses equivalent to purgatory in Catholicism?

&amp;#x200B;

What happened when Christ descended into hell before ascending to Heaven after He died (and when exactly did that happen in the timeline of events)?

&amp;#x200B;

What exactly will happen in the Second Coming? Why does the Bible say that He will judge both living and dead when the dead are already judged? Aren't our ancestors already in the ""appropriate"" afterlife place (Heaven/hell)?  Will there be a new Kingdom of Heaven where the souls will be ""transported"" after the Second Coming?

Why do we pray for our dead relatives if it's already decided where they will go right after they die (of course, after the 40 days) and they're already there (or is it)? Is Heaven same for everyone, or are there various positions (according to what we deserve)?

So I figured that I would offer something that might be helpful in the aftermath of the recent events in Minneapolis.

———————————————————————

To those who are angry, I understand your rage against the horrible atrocities committed against marginalized communities, but I will ask that we all remember the words of the blessed St. Paul, who wrote:

&gt; “For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.” (Ephesians 6:12).

I too am angry and frustrated at the injustices of the corrupt and prejudiced system which rules our nation, but our anger towards those within must be tempered with a pity and a sorrow for their spiritual state. These oppressors are likewise in the image of God, and are simply ensnared by the evil, satanic system which has trapped many in a cycle of hate and violence. However, our anger must be placed with the spiritual illness which permeates our society. 

Pray not only for the victims of police brutality, but also for the officers blinded to the atrocities and sinful hate by their position and the fear that is instilled. Pray that not only will God heal the brokenness of the oppressed, but remove the scales from the eyes of the oppressors. If St. Paul, a Pharisee of the Pharisees and former persecutor of the Church, can be redeemed, even the worst oppressor can have their eyes and hearts opened to the truth. We should not only pray, but also seek justice for the oppressed, hold the powerful to account for their wrongdoings, and be living images of the Savior in the public sphere. The world needs Christ’s love today as much as it did when the Lord first walked among men, and only be living our Faith can we hope to truly seek the conversion and repentance of not only the oppressors, but the whole of society. 

I pray that we all can acknowledge that Christ will heal the wounds of the oppressed, but also that He can remove the scales from the eyes of the oppressors. Seek the repentance of our enemies and those who persecute, just as Christ did.",OrthodoxChristianity
Why is [Orthodox] Christianity so different from Judaism?,GloryToICXC,1590742491,"In Orthodoxy, there is a Holy Spirit, baptism, saints, and no unclean foods. There is no such thing as a Jew or gentile, just people in Christ. The worship is different with the chanting, crossing yourself, incense everywhere, and the seven sacraments. There is a heaven and a hell. 

In Judaism, it’s vastly different. There is no such thing as baptism, only mikveh immersion. There is no such thing as “being filled with the Holy Ghost.”  There are no saints. There are no sacraments. There are only Jews and gentiles. The commandments given by God to the Jews must be followed until the end. No bowing to icons or any “idols.” The God of the OT seems very different from the one in the NT. In the OT, He is much more strict, commanding, violent, whereas in the NT, it’s all about love. The messiah in the Hebrew Bible is supposed to be a great human, not divine, leader who will bring all the Jews to Israel, reestablish the temple, and usher in an era of peace. There was not much concept about an afterlife until the times of the Pharisees where the concepts of Gan Eden and Gehenna were developed. 

That’s all I can think of at the top of my head, but why is it that these two faiths are completely different? How were baptism and the Eucharist, crossing yourself, concept of the messiah, etc. founded when it didn’t happen or is very different than in Judaism?",OrthodoxChristianity

Opinions,stukamenos,1590699866,"Growing I up, I had an inherent curiosity about religion. My parents were very ""surface"" Christians, not really religious, but for some reason, religion had an appeal to me.

I would search and read religious books from a very young age, I wanted contact with God. But because contact never came I thought provoking one would be a good idea. Often times I would do bad things, childish bad things. Obviously I never got a sign or whatever.

At the age of 11 or 12 I got really angry at God (I forgot to mention that I had an interest on the occult too), to the point that I spat on an icon of Virgin Mary. I know I deserve to burn in hell.

In any case, a year after that incident I went to my room, I don't remember the reason why, but I went to pray in front of the icon of virgin Mary. It was a very small icon which someone could fold like a book. Actually it had two icons, one of the virgin Mary and one some saints, I don't remember all of them, but one was a child, I think Saint agape.

The moment I raised my hand to make the sign of the cross the icon turned around. Like I could see the back of the icon. It happened in what seemed less than a second. I got stunned for a while and after I realised what had happened I run in the living room.

After I calmed down, I came back to my room, placed  the icon the way it was, did my cross abd and left. Years passed by, and I was going back and forth from believer to non believer. Eventuallybecame an agnostic, don't know if that matters but I tried rationalising gmy experience.

What if it is a psychotic episode? An illusion? Back then, a friend of mine told me that God turned his back on me. I was scared.

I always wanted to believe. I wanted to have faith, but somehow it does not work. Every answer generates more questions. I am looking literally everywhere. Hinduism, NDEs, I troll catholics on reddit. Jokes aside, how should I interpret the incident? Anyone willing to give an opinion feel free.

*These tales depict ancient monasticism as if in a painting. The old narrators depicted with simplicity and fidelity both the amazing spiritual perfection of the monastic life of the first centuries of Christianity, and the various passions of many of its members for the infirmity of the nature corrupted by the fall. And with the fidelity combined with the simplicity that distinguishes this painting, the position of ancient monasticism, being separated from us by the space of many centuries, remains not quite clear, as if the building is separated from the eyes by a thick fog.From the spectacle presented to antiquity, let us turn to the spectacle presented to modernity. What should we say about ourselves? how do we live, how do we act? The answer to these questions is found in the ancient monks: they foreshadowed our position; they also foreshadowed the way of acting in this position. ""In the last time —"" said one of them, "" those who will truly work for God will prudently hide themselves from men, and will not perform signs and wonders in the midst of them, as at present. They will follow the path of doing, dissolved by humility, and in the Kingdom of heaven will be greater than their Fathers, who were glorified by signs."" What a thorough instruction, what a comfort to us in these prophetic words of the banner-bearing and spirit-bearing Father! Because of the multiplication of temptations, because of their universality and dominance, because of the forgetfulness of the gospel commandments and their neglect by all mankind, it is necessary for those who want to be saved to withdraw from human society into solitude, external and internal. Because of the exhaustion of gracious leaders, because of the multiplication of false teachers, deceived by devilish charm and attracting the whole world to this deception, it is necessary to live, dissolved in humility, it is necessary to live exactly according to the gospel commandments, it is necessary to combine prayer with weeping for oneself and for all mankind, it is necessary to be careful from any exaltation, thinking to perform the work of God by human forces alone, without God acting and performing his work. He who saves, let him save his soul, said to the remnant of Christians, said by the Spirit of God. Save yourself! blessed are you if you find one faithful like-minded in the work of salvation: this is a great and rare gift of God in our time. Beware, wishing to save your neighbor, so that he does not drag you into a perilous abyss. The latter can be hourly. The retreat is permitted by God: do not attempt to stop it with your feeble hand. Get rid of it, get rid of it yourself: and that's enough for you. Get acquainted with the spirit of the time, study it, so as to avoid its influence as much as possible. ""Now there is almost no true piety,"" says Saint Tikhon a hundred years before, "" now there is only hypocrisy."" Be afraid of hypocrisy, first in yourself, then in others; be afraid precisely because it is in the nature of time and is capable of infecting anyone with the slightest deviation into frivolous behavior. Do not fight in public, but in secret for your salvation, in the sight of God, and your conduct will be cleansed from hypocrisy. Do not condemn your neighbors, leaving the judgment of them to God — and your heart will be cleansed from hypocrisy. Pursue hypocrisy in yourself, expelling it from yourself; turn away from the infected masses, who  acting deliberately and unconsciously towards him, covering service to the world — the service of God, get temporary benefits — get the benefits of the eternal, covering the guise of Holiness vicious life and soul, entirely devoted to the passions.*",OrthodoxChristianity

For that were contrary to the nature of God, who is the common Father of all, and no respecter of persons, and would have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth; {1 Timothy 2:4} but since He foreknew the one would make a right use of their free-will, and the other a wrong, He predestinated the one, or condemned the other. And we understand the use of free-will thus, that the Divine and illuminating grace, and which we call preventing grace, being, as a light to those in darkness, by the Divine goodness imparted to all, to those that are willing to obey this — for it is of use only to the willing, not to the unwilling — and co-operate with it, in what it requireth as necessary to salvation, there is consequently granted particular grace; which, co-operating &lt;115&gt; with us, and enabling us, and making us perseverant in the love of God, that is to say, in performing those good things that God would have us to do, and which His preventing grace admonisheth us that we should do, justifieth us, and maketh us predestinated. But those who will not obey, and co-operate with grace; and, therefore, will not observe those things that God would have us perform, and that abuse in the service of Satan the free-will, which they have received of God to perform voluntarily what is good, are consigned to eternal condemnation.

&gt; But to say, as the most wicked heretics do and as is contained in the Chapter answering hereto — that God, in predestinating, or condemning, had in no wise regard to the works of those predestinated, or condemned, we know to be profane and impious. For thus Scripture would be opposed to itself, since it promiseth the believer salvation through works, yet supposeth God to be its sole author, by His sole illuminating grace, which He bestoweth without preceding works, to shew to man the truth of divine things, and to teach him how he may co-operate therewith, if he will, and do what is good and acceptable, and so obtain &lt;116&gt; salvation. He taketh not away the power to will — to will to obey, or not obey him.

&gt; But than to affirm that the Divine Will is thus solely and without cause the author of their condemnation, what greater calumny can be fixed upon God? and what greater injury and blasphemy can be offered to the Most High? For that the Deity is not tempted with evils, {cf. James 1:13} and that He equally willeth the salvation of all, since there is no respect of persons with Him, we do know; and that for those who through their own wicked choice, and their impenitent heart, have become vessels of dishonour, there is, as is just, decreed condemnation, we do confess. But of eternal punishment, of cruelty, of pitilessness, and of inhumanity, we never, never say God is the author, who telleth us that there is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth. {Luke 15:7} Far be it from us, while we have our senses, thus to believe, or to think; and we do subject to an eternal anathema those who say and think such things, and esteem them to be worse than any infidels. &lt;117&gt;

I know that the Orthodox Church teaches that God predestines according to his foreknowledge, but (acknowledging that it is best to to pry too much into these things) how can that be the case if the church also teaches against ""once saved, always saved""?

Imagine somebody who is truly saved, if they die this instant they will go to heaven, but 10 years later, for whatever reason, they are no longer saved, and die.

Now imagine this same person dying in only 1 year, while they are still saved

The overall point being that there are surely those who would be saved given the right circumstances, but are not put into those circumstances, as well as those who would be damned given the right(or wrong) circumstances, but are not born into, or ever encounter those circumstances, as is seen in the two scenarios of the man, in one he dies saved, in the other he dies unsaved, and seeing as the Church teaches it is possible to fall away, this is entirely possible.

What, therefore is meant by ""since He foreknew the one would make a right use of their free-will, and the other a wrong, He predestinated the one, or condemned the other""?",OrthodoxChristianity
Difference between Orthodox spirituality and non-Christian spirituality,georglukacs,1590621871,"An image occurred to me today as I was thinking about what is different about Orthodox spirituality from non-Orthodox, especially non-Christian spiritualities. If we take the person to be a clay vessel half full of water, non-Orthodox spiritualities attempt to purify the vessel by various methods, such as tipping out the water (Buddhist no-mind), or heating it up (yogas, mantras), which result in futile works and a hardening of the heart. The Orthodox on the other hand fill the rest of the vessel with the light of grace and let the light purify and sanctify the water of the heart-nous. Do you think this is an accurate representation?",OrthodoxChristianity

Aerial Toll Houses,theserviceofhishonor,1590617865,"So recently I was looking into Orthodoxy, and I came across ""Toll houses"". I see that after death, demons attempt to accuse you of sin and drag you to hell because of any unrepentant sin, and I've even seen that some icons depict God holding scales, to see if our Good outweighs our Bad. Is this not kind of like works salvation? Since you have to do works (Good deeds and repentance) to enter heaven? Another thing is that this seems to defeat the purpose of Jesus' work on the cross, if a man who had the strongest faith but failed to repent of a particular sin before his death, could go to hell because of it.

I've heard these are ""allegorical"", but I'm not sure. Could someone help me understand this?",OrthodoxChristianity
What was the function of the money changers in the Temple?,thomas_basic,1590615473,Reading John’s gospel where Jesus confronts money changers. It says their kiosks are set up at (or maybe in) the Temple at Jerusalem. Where there Jews assembling there from outside Rome that needed to buy Roman currency to purchase votive offerings with? Or were they using Roman currency to buy silver or gold to pay for votive offerings? What was the system here? And why was Jesus offended by them?,OrthodoxChristianity
