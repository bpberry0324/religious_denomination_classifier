What is the proper way to do the Liturgy of the Hours?,markusmatthewhill,1626825422,"I had started doing it today but I think I messed it up. 

First off, I use an app for this and do not have the set of books. I use DivineOffice. This app has what I THINK is the more traditional schedule structure of morning, midmorning, midday, afternoon, evening, and night. 

To be honest, though, I don't understand the whole structural concept for the schedule at all. Does that aforementioned schedule deviate from the modern norm? I don't know. 

They weren't lying when they said the Liturgy of the Hours is a big undertaking hahaha. 

Regardless, here's my actual question: this morning, I went to start the Liturgy for the first time. However, I had to skip the morning prayers as it was past noon by the time I was able to. My understanding was that the Divine Office is only necessary if you're starting with the morning prayers, so I did not do it. 

I did, however, do the Invitatory. I think.

Is the invitatory solely ""Lord, open our lips and we shall praise your name""? Or is there more to it than that. If there is, then I did NOT do the Invitatory hahaha.",Catholicism

Friendly Reminder to Pray for (and be wary of) Protestants,nillin_wafer,1626818614,"Keeping what the Catechism says in paragraphs 817-822 in mind, I just wanted to remark that the emotional/practical “appeal” of Protestant (particularly Evangelical) churches is something many Catholics I know struggle with. I say this too as someone who grew up in that tradition before my call to convert. I know there is an authenticity and fervor to what many Protestants do. Sometimes the preaching in Prot. churches is rhetorically better than a typical homily during Mass. This, however, is not the determinant for truth, as good as it might “feel” to anyone.

I heard just earlier today that a Catholic family member of my (Protestant) family’s fellow Baptist congregants was visiting and attended service at said Baptist church. They remarked happily after the sermon that they had “never heard anything like it” to which many responded, thinking this person would forsake his Romish, works-based religion, “praise God!” No surprise I said a prayer for this person, that they persevere in faith and not fall for emotional parlor tricks. The Eucharist alone is reason enough to go sprinting back to Mass, in my opinion. To people who see the appeal in Evangelical rock concert services, I long to ask “what about Jesus!?”

Encourage one another to understand and learn what to expect when listening to these charismatic types. Not every word they say is false, but embracing their “faith alone, scripture alone” falsehoods wounds one’s sense of reason deeply, to the point that it is hard to discern what is true. I should know: I’ve been debating my family in the fullness of the charity I can muster about such things for years. 

Pray for and evangelize Protestants. Invite them to “come and see.” Embrace the unity and fullness of the Church as the Body of Christ and thereby put our Lord on display. Commercial non-denom mega churches might disappear (please Lord) in the next decade or so, but the “doctrinally sound” churches that cling to “core doctrines” in rebellion to the full teaching authority of Rome don’t appear to be losing steam, as they have persisted in their ways for the past 500 years.

What happens if the Church is overrun by heresy and has it happened in its history to an extreme extent?,themathlad,1626816908,"Hello, this is hypothetical and born out of possibly an irrational fear for the future of our Church.

If we had a Pope that outright embraced heresy and initiated massive reforms that allowed the blessing of same sex unions, made divorce essentially okay, maybe even allowed abortion(as a lot of bishops seem to want to happen right now), what would the faithful have to do? Would the seat of St. Peter indeed be vacant?
Also I know that a lot of clergy show support for such heretical ideas, is it rational to be afraid that the Church will actually embrace heresy in such a way?  If it does, would the validity of the Church be disproven, or would the faithful have to revolt and do something similar to the sedevacantists?

I don’t mean any of this to insult the current Pope, I’m just genuinely concerned with the direction I see much of the leadership of the Church going in places like Germany and the Jesuit order, and I want to know what to do if (worst case scenario) this disease spreads all the way to to the top and we end up with like 70%+ of our clergy preaching heresy.",Catholicism

Eastern Orthodox Christian wondering about Catholic atonement?,AllisModesty,1626811354,"I am an Eastern Orthodox Christian. Our view of atonement is that Christ died to “trample death with death”. Christ defeated sin by his sinlessness, death by his resurrection and offers us the opportunity to be free from sin and healed of our sinful nature in his incarnation. St. Athanasius wrote, “God became man so that man might become god”. St. Gregory the Theologian affirms, “What is not assumed cannot be healed”. 

Correct me if I am mistaken, but my understanding of western theology (specifically, Catholic theology) emphasizes the wrath of God and consequently paints a picture of an “angry God”.

For instance, the dominant view of the western view of atonement prior to the Anselm was that of a “ransom theory”. In essence, Adam and Eve sold humanity to the devil, and God purchased us back by the crucifixion acting as a sacrificial lamb of sorts, similar to the sacrificial lambs of first and second temple Judaism.

Anselm developed the idea that our sins were so depraved that God needed to exact his wrath on his son in order to pay the debt we owe to God because of our various legalistic transgressions against God. In short, we broke God’s cosmic rules, so Jesus paid them back to redeem us.

The two first theories emphasize God’s wrath. Only the Orthodox view seems to emphasize God’s love and his desire to save us rather than fulfilling some cosmic wrath.

Am I misunderstanding something? Please forgive me and correct any misconceptions about Rome’s understanding of atonement. It seems to be incredibly legalistic and paint God’s nature as revolving around wrath and anger rather than love and a desire to heal.",Catholicism

Not sure how to confront my non-practicing Catholic relatives in a charitable way,catholicgwustudent,1626808650,"Hello everyone,

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on a topic that has been on my mind for a while now. I work for my relatives’ catering company, which is only run on the weekends, since it’s meant to help supplement my parents’ income from what they do in their regular jobs. Unfortunately, that has taken away my ability to go to Mass and fulfill my Sunday obligation since my Bishop eliminated the dispensation. 

Unfortunately, my relatives are severely non-practicing Catholics and have gone to Mass in many years. My mother has been staunchly against going to Mass and Confession, for her own personal reasons. I go to Confession at least once a week, and Mass on the weekdays twice, maybe 3 times a week. 

I brought up the idea to my mother that maybe we should consider not working on Sunday, or at the very least work less. I was met with a very angry response, which ultimately came to my mother telling that “talking about religion is too hard and too complicated,” and she went to bed angry. I’ve tried being charitable to her about this and have been met with nothing but yelling and frustration from my mother. My father is largely indifferent and does not step into the conversation. That was about a year ago, before my grandfather’s passing, and now she fights with her siblings about his inheritance to his children. This often turns into yelling matches and no progress has been made. I feel this is all they talk about, and this had made her faith even more weak. Recently, she told my aunt that (paraphrasing here) “it doesn’t matter what religion you are, as long you’re good with God, you’re okay,” and I want to confront her about this, but in a charitable way that won’t get her angry and fuming at me.

Now, every time I go to Confession I fear I will have to explain my situation every single time to the priest and will be seen as unrepentant and therefore not able to receive absolution. I’m not sure how to confront this matter. I was wondering if anyone had advice.",Catholicism

I currently am trying to quit the habit of habitual masturbation.

I ask because I am currently on my 4th straight day of not masturbating, however I am worried that if I fall into temptation then I will not be able to receive the eucharist due to being in a state of mortal sin, or would it be venial under this context (of trying actively to quit, however slipping in once)?

"Media continuously misrepresents or exaggerates 'bad' things the Church does, while ignoring all the good and help to society that the Church does.",zogins,1626799899,"I was taken aback to read that a Catholic school was preventing its students to wear masks because 'masks cover the face and we should never cover our faces because they were made in the image of God.'

This sounds like pure made-up poppycock. In all my experience with the Catholic church, there were some times when I did not agree with certain positions or statements but I always found the church and its hierarchy to be mature, wise, practical, and reasonable. During the current pandemic, the Church in my country has gone beyond the measures imposed by the government and is taking extreme precautions. It stopped masses for months and now that masses have restarted, the precautions that are being taken are far better than those taken by any other organisation.

Last weekend I attended for a baptism and I was surprised to be told that the baby was 1 year old. All ceremonies had been stopped and even now baptisms are held in an empty church with just the immediate family members of the child. The priest does not touch the baby, the oil is applied by the mother; the water is blessed by laying on of hands and not by touching it. This is just a very brief list of all the precautions the Catholic Church is taking.

"Baptist considering conversion, but one thing in particular bothers me about Catholicism",Cole_B_Covington,1626799172,"I'm a guy in his mid twenties who grew up in an Independent Fundamentalist Baptist Church in the southern US. I've spent the past year and a half to two years learning about the doctrinal differences between the faith that I grew up with and Catholicism. I think that the Catholic position on major doctrinal differences such as the importance of tradition and the nature of salvation are logically sound , although I am not yet 100% convinced that they are correct (I'd be in RCIA if I were). 

That being said, I really struggle with the thought of converting to Catholicism because so much of the Catholic church these days seems apathetic. When I look at my friends who grew up in evangelical churches and my friends who ""were raised Catholic"", the former group largely seems to stay in the church, believe in the moral teachings of the church, don't drink/do drugs, don't have premarital sex, etc. It's a very different story for my Catholic friends. I know that this is my anecdotal experience, but I saw polling the other day that aligned with this almost perfectly (this is what inspired me to post this).

I also look at the actions of many priests (James Martin comes to mind) who actively thumb their noses at church doctrine but don't ever really get rebuked.  Meanwhile Pope Francis is focused on non-issues like banning the latin mass.

On an intellectual level I feel like Catholicism *might* be correct, but I just struggle on an emotional level to feel like this is the one true church when it feels like only a small minority of Catholics (including many clergy!) actually take their religion seriously. It feels like I would be leaving a very healthy church community for one that is not healthy

Religion and lack there of has a lot more to do with morality than most people realize.,MrMcGoofy03,1626799025,"I was discussing objective morality with some people and they were saying how it's ""wrong to force a certain belief on others"". At that moment I had an idea and was curious about where it would lead me, so I asked the people ""how do you know that statement is true?"" and they couldn't really answer it besides ""it just is"" and that's when it hit me, we all have things we take as 'moral truths' things that are true because they ""just are"" and we inherently feel their true. There is no such thing as 'not forcing your beliefs on others, even secularism promotes morals such as ""it's wrong to force your beliefs on others"".

remember either:

a.) God exists and objective moral truths are real whether we believe in God or not.

b.) God doesn't exist and there are no moral truths whether we believe in God or not, thus every morality is subjective and no one is more ""correct"" than the other.

Thus in order for a society to have any sort of morality or laws for people to follow we have to push **something** on people, **something** has to be made a moral truth in which society must base itself off. In secular society things like ""you can't force your beliefs on others"" are made and taught as moral truths, yet assuming an atheistic worldview there's nothing to base that claim on, thus it is not objectively true.

In order for a morality to be objectively true it would need something to be based off and to maintain it, we would call that thing God. By choosing to believe in God we accept that he has laid out to us certain moral truths such as ""murdering innocent people is wrong"", ""stealing is wrong"" etc...

By choosing not to believe in God then you're still going to have to come to some moral truths, some people choose frame works like utilitarianism to fill that gap and others make up their own. Then there are those who are of different religions and use different morals as well.

The point I'm trying to make is that there are no such things as ""morals without religion or lack of religion"", religion and lack there of dictates what we perceive to be moral. That's why we can't change someone's mind on ""is killing wrong"" unless they have a massive conversion in their hearts.

If God exists (which I think he does) the issue then becomes that moral truths exist but people choose not to recognize them. So we will push our moral view on society and create laws around them. While people of other moralities will try and do the same with their moral frame works. We can't logically disprove each other, instead we would have to prove our religious viewpoint to be correct first in order to 'logically' get people onto our side.

That's why for example when I debate people on topics like Euthanasia and Abortion and someone says ""why is killing innocent people objectively wrong"", it's not that I don't have an answer, it's that I don't have an answer that people who base their lives off a moral framework will like... that ""God gives life inherent value"" this is only true if God exists, which usually the interlocutor disagrees with and hence will accuse the other person of ""forcing their beliefs on others"" or states that ""you can't use religion in a debate about legislating law in a secular country"" but at the end of the day if God does exist then that's the only real proof that logically killing innocent people is **objectively** morally wrong. Otherwise if God doesn't exist then there is **no** objective truth for anything, we're both equally right and wrong at the same time. There would be no reason that killing innocent people is wrong besides a personal belief.

That is why I believe religion and lack there of shapes societies moralities and why very basic moral truths simply cannot be logically communicated to people who have arrived at different belief systems as objective morals come from God. Which even if we know to be true there are still people who assert that he does not exist and as such dismiss the notion of the existence of objective morals.",Catholicism

A Catholic introduction to Mormon temple ceremonies,infinityball,1626796723,"I recently [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/ontba9/are_catholics_allowed_to_attend_religious/h5vpkmw/) to another thread about Mormon temple ceremonies, and thought that my fellow Catholics might be interested in understanding Mormon theology and the ceremonies that occur in their temples.

I do this in a spirit of ecumenical understanding, not simply to satisfy curiosity. Mormons are famously secretive of what goes on in the temple; thus, I will not be sharing the most secretive elements of the ceremonies, which participants take a vow never to reveal.

However, it is helpful to understand the theology of other religions. So here it goes.

In Mormonism, [**temples**](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/photo-gallery?lang=eng) **are sacred places reserved for performing specific ceremonies** they call *ordinances*, similar (though with differences) to the Catholic idea of sacraments. In Mormonism each ordinance is tied to the idea of making individual covenants with God.

**Who can attend the temple?** Only adult Mormons who regularly attend church, assert belief in the church's teachings, pay 10% of their income to the church, and live according to a set of moral rules can enter. Every two years you must meet with your local bishop to be interviewed (you can see the questions [here](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/october-2019-general-conference-temple-recommend)). If you meet the standards you are issued a [temple recommend](http://www.mormonthink.com/img/temple-recommend.jpg), a piece of paper allowing you to enter. (Modern ones have a barcode tied to you.) Being a ""temple-recommend-holding"" member is an important mark of faithfulness in Mormonism.

**What goes on inside?** As I said above, they perform ceremonies they call ""ordinances"" in the temple. Mormons believe that in temples they can perform these ceremonies for themselves, but also for those who have already died (pending the acceptance of the ceremony by the dead person, who retains free will after death). So active Mormons will attend the temple many times throughout their life. A monthly or bimonthly cadence is common. Only the first time do you perform these ceremonies for yourself; every time after that, you are given the name of a dead person for whom you are acting in proxy.

**Ordinances vs Sacraments**. There is a distinct difference between the Mormon idea of ordinances and the Catholic idea of sacraments. In a Mormon ordinance, the ceremony is chiefly to instruct and be the vehicle of a ""covenant"" made between the individual and God. In Catholicism, the sacraments are ""efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us"" (CCC 1131). This explains why Catholic give sacraments in infants, but Mormons consider this incorrect. An infant cannot be instructed or make an individual covenant. But for Catholics, infants can receive grace and the gift of divine life.

Ordinances in Mormonism are objectively effective (e.g., baptisms does wash away all sin), but are only effective if the participant actively wills it (repentance is required for baptism). The real effect is in *the creation of the covenant*, which can be broken later and thus make it of no effect. As an example, I am an ex-Mormon and have resigned my membership. Therefore, in the eyes of the Mormon church, I am unbaptized, which means if I were to return to the Mormon church I would need to be baptized again.

**The ceremonies performed in the temple**:

**Baptisms for the Dead**: This is the exception to the ""adult"" rule above, they allow teenagers to do this. In the basement of each LDS temple there is a [baptismal font](https://assets.ldscdn.org/e1/e0/e1e0ade40897d948ea60bd1290e5bede2f71a2af/ogden_temple_font_baptistry.jpeg) where teenagers and adults go and are baptized by full immersion on behalf of those who have died. They are subsequently confirmed in the Mormon church for these persons also. Mormons intend to perform baptisms (and *all* the ceremonies listed below) for basically every person that has ever lived.

**Washing and Anointing**: Adults who go to the temple for their ""temple ordinances"" begin with a ceremonial washing and anointing. You sit in a chair, and a series of church Elders place hands on your head and symbolically wash and anoint your body. This is inspired by accounts in Exodus where Aaron and his sons are washed and anointed prior to their service in the temple. They used to actually put water and oil on various body parts, which required the attendee to be ... basically naked. When had mine, I wore a sort of toga open on both sides called a ""shield,"" and the Elders washing and anointing my ""loins"" got uncomfortably close. (It wasn't sexual in any way.) More recently they have changed the ceremony to be more ""symbolic"" in nature, so the Elders' hands never leave your head. A blessing is pronounced on each part of your body as you are symbolically washed and anointed. At the end of this ceremony you are ""clothed"" in the [religious undergarment](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/sacred-temple-clothing?lang=eng) that afterwards you are expected to consistently wear for the rest of your life.

**Endowment Ceremony**: After the washing and anointing, you are led to [a room with many chairs](https://d3ewd3ysu1dfsj.cloudfront.net/images/stories/large/54136.jpg?1568734250), and aisle down the middle. You participate in a ceremony with many other people where a film is shown. It's a narrative of the creation of the world, Adam/Eve, the fall, and redemption. The women sit on the left of the aisle, the men on the right. Each person is considered ""Adam and Eve"" themselves, and along with the Adam and Eve in the film you are taught secret handclasps, pass-phrases, and names which are required to enter the highest heaven and live with God. Mormons consider these secrets very sacred, so I won't go into details. If you read masonic literature, they are extremely similar, in some cases identical. You also put on ritual priestly robes during the ceremony. You make ""covenants"" to live moral lives, follow the church, obey leaders, etc. It lasts a little over an hour. At the end of the ceremony you are tested on your knowledge of the secret handclasps, pass-phrases, and names, and then enter the [""celestial room,""](https://www.ldsliving.com/23-Beautiful-Celestial-Rooms-Around-the-World-Photos/s/81162) which symbolizes being in God's presence.

**Eternal Marriage**: The final ceremony is marriage ""for eternity."" Mormons believe that God is an exalted human man married to an exalted human woman (plot twist! he may even be a polygamist) and thus Mormon men and women are married for eternity so they can live like God (who is also married) and continue to have an eternity of spirit children. This is where the idea of Mormons ""becoming gods"" comes from. This is done in [a room with an alter](https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/kyTrfFy1WbBTN3l5tLATNCoV7EU=/1024x650/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/PUBB4AP3MNGCNHSMWKBUQ6HW6E.JPG). (The surrounding chairs are for those coming as wedding guests.) A man and a women kneel on opposite ends of the alter, hold hands (using one of the secret handclasps learned in the Endowment ceremony), and a short marriage ceremony is performed. Each wears the ceremonial priestly robes worn during the endowment ceremony. Each party gives consent with a simple ""yes,"" and then are ""sealed"" for eternity. Couples already married can have their marriage ""sealed"" as well.

**Second Anointing**: This ceremony is so secret that even most active, temple-attending Mormons do not even know this ceremony exists. I'd only ever heard of it in whispers until after I left the Mormon faith and began doing research. For example, one of the [only references](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel/chapter-19?lang=eng) online in an official Mormon publication simply states: ""Do *not* attempt in any way to discuss or answer questions about the second anointing."" However, several recent ex-Mormons [have described](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/tom-phillips-and-the-second-anointing/) their second anointing. It is typically only given to senior church leadership and their spouses.

In the [second anointing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_anointing), a husband and wife both go to the temple secretly (usually when the temple is closed to the public) and are met there by a senior church leader, typically one of the church's 12 Apostles. He then washes the feet of each husband in attendance and anoints him a king and a priest to God. He then anoints the wife to be a queen and priestess to her husband. Then each couple retires to a room in private. The wife then ritually prepares her husband for death and resurrection, washes his feet, then lays her hands on his head and gives him a blessing.

The second anointing is a guarantee to the couple that they will be exalted in heaven. This is very speculative theology in Mormonism, there really isn't a clear answer as to what occurs if the couple commits serious sin after this. Presumably, they are still guaranteed ""exaltation"" in God's kingdom.

---

If you want to dig deeper, [this website](http://www.ldsendowment.org/) has accurate information on the ceremonies on their history. The ceremonies have changed many times over the years, including the past few years, to better match current sentiment and modern times. I hope I have been respectful in my descriptions. I'm an ex-Mormon myself and do not have ill-will toward Mormonism or the temple. I do, however, think the Mormon church should be open and honest about what occurs inside.

It is also instructive to understand Mormon theology around the temple. This area of Mormon theology is often hidden away from view, and many Mormons are often disinclined to discuss it. This is both because it is very sacred to them, and also because they fear others will mock something they hold very dear. So I hope you are respectful in the comments.

Does God really punish the world according to Catholic theology?,cp4h,1626796156,"I love the Fatima apparition but the mentioning of God's chastisement of the world communicated by the Holy Virgin to the three sheppards and to Sister Lucia later on in particular made me slightly uncomfortable .... in the Old Testament perception of God's punishment seems common, but in the Gospel it seems Jesus portraits a loving Father that is different than what is described in the Old Testament.

Sola Gratia - The role of grace in our salvation,domesticenginerd_,1626795703,"Hey r/Catholicism!

Some background before I share an article and also ask some questions…

Nudged by prayer, scripture, and life experiences, I have been thinking a lot about grace lately. I have also been thinking about the role it plays in the lives we are given and in our salvation.

I understand that “sola fide” one of of the key parts of Luther’s concerns with the Catholic Church’s teachings.

Even if I see things a little differently than Luther did, I get where he’s coming from — we do not earn our salvation. It is an unmerited gift of God.

Even our faith, our fiats, our strengths, our blessings, and our good works are due to the grace of God. (As I reflect on my life-to-date, I am humbled by the ways that God has pursued me and has allowed me to serve Him on earth.)

All this to say, I have been really thinking about God’s unmerited grace and when I do, it gives me deep gratitude.

I believe that our viewpoint of how grace works is one of the linchpins that will help as we bridge misunderstandings with others. As we deepen our understanding and appreciation for God’s grace, I believe it can also empower us to more effectively navigate the world and serve others as disciplines of Christ. I believe it can also motivate us to continue to serve diligently as workers in the vineyard.

Interestingly enough, I found an article from 2015 that covers the Church’s stance on how grace, faith, and works and how they fit together. Here it is: https://mcn.aod.org/2015/12/grace-faith-and-works-how-to-untangle-the-catholic-teaching/

What does it mean that God loves everyone?,New_General_6287,1626794581,"When I was little primary school or so I finally grasped the exact details of my heart disease. I think I was 8, when it kinda dawned on me ""I was supposed to die. God made me in a way that I was supposed to die."" If not for an innovative heart surgery when I was less than 2 months old I would have died. I wondered back then if the doctors did something bad by saving me, after all God made me in a way where i was supposed to die. I wondered if it was a sin for me alive. I remember when we went to church I would kneel down in a way that would make my knees hurt a lot because I thought God wanted me to suffer. It was weird.  


Over time my views fluctuated. Maybe the miracle is that I was saved and I was meant for something great? I developed a superiority complex thinking my suffering made me special. Eventually when I met the love of my life I thought ""it was all for this moment"". I felt like a weight was lifted of my shoulder as all the suffering suddenly made, sense but she left too and with her left the purpose of my suffering and any point my life had.

When my life started going to shit a few months ago I got 2 response ""read Job"" and ""it'll eventually get better"". It never got better, it just kept getting worse and it keepts getting worse. I read the story of Job a lot I've really come to hate that story.

What was that story? God made a bet with no reward on either end. A bet with only pride on the line with the devil, to turn the life of a man who did nothing wrong into a living hell. The moral of the story is supposed to be that he preserved in loving God and was rewarded, but what about his family? His children and wife all died, most of them died having resented God and they ended up in hell. They wouldn't have if God did not let them be used as tools in the bet, and then at the end they were all replaced, as if human beings just can be replaced like that.

It's such a fucked up story. maybe it's just fucked up to me because I see myself more in the side characters of Job's wife and children than in Job.",Catholicism

"What, in practical day application, does a priests' ability to ""retain sins"" look like? Also a question on the proof that this power transferred through Apostolic Succession.",TexanLoneStar,1626788342,"Correct me if I am wrong but it seems like the only time a priest retains sins during the Sacrament of Confession is if the penitent is unrepentant.

However, that doesn't really sound like the priest is retaining anything, but the penitent making it unable to be retained in the first place.

The power to forgive sins is obviously manifested through absolution, but in today's practice of confession what does retainment of sin look like?

Also I was wondering if there's any apologetical verses of Scripture, patristics, other writings, anything that defends the idea that the power to bind and loose sins passes down from the 11 disciples to their successors.

Many Protestants will deny that the Holy Spirit has the ability to forgive sins through priests entirely, but usually with enough reasoning they come to accept that this power was given to the 11 disciples after Easter. They argue, however, that this was solely given to them alone. Any sort of arguments against this? Of all things to defend in Catholic Christianity I honestly find this one of the harder ones because a lot of Protestant Christians operate on Sola Scriptura, thus they will not be convinced of patristic writing, even if the writing is temporally within a few decades of the events of the Bible.",Catholicism

I love this prayer because its words tell us not to just ask but also to accept God's will.,zogins,1626784310,"I live in Malta - a very small Catholic, European Union nation. Next to the mainland is a tiny island called Gozo (population less than 40,000). The people on this island are even more Catholic than us on the mainland.

There is a beautiful basilica dedicated to the Madonna Ta'Pinu. You can read about how this basilica came to be built on a small remote island in the link. Popes have visited it, as the painting, or what it represents, is considered miraculous. 

Many people, even atheists, have had deep mystical experiences after visiting this basilica. The back of the basilica is surrounded by ex voto paintings and hundreds of ex-voto memorials left by people who claim some miraculous intervention by the Madonna at this site.

I, and many people I know, are moved very deeply when we visit this shrine. This is the prayer we recite:

 *O Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, who recommended your servant  Carmela Grima to recite “Three Hail Mary’s” in honor of the three days  your body remained in the sepulchre, look pitifully at the upset world  and deliver humanity from the threatening spiritual and social  calamities.

"I am against murder. ANY TYPE of murder. I am ecstatic that finally, our beloved Pope Francis has spoken against capital punishment.",zogins,1626782831,"I am from a European country, where, as far as I can see the police and judicial systems are different from those in the USA.

We abolished capital punishment almost a century ago and abortion is illegal. Unfortunately, a very few left-leaning people are becoming very vociferous in their demand for a form of 'soft abortion' where it is only allowed if the pregnancy is putting the mother's health at risk or in the case of rape or severe problems with the foetus.

Most of us Catholics are adamant that abortion will introduce a culture of death and instead of vying for abortion we support adoption, fostering and the utmost respect for all humans.

Our culture is different from that in the USA. Our police do not normally carry guns or any type of weapon when they are working. As a result of this gun crime in my country is extremely low and when it occurs, the criminal uses a sawn off bird hunting shotgun which cannot even kill a human except at very close range.

At most our police use pepper spray (this is not standard issue and they have to sign for it when they think they need it). Recently tasers have been introduced. These are not standard issue but are kept locked up in each police station. If a call comes in where it is suspected that violence will be involved, the police ask for a taser. If they fire the taser, the taser itself will record for how long they pressed the button and a camera will record what they do.

The motto of our police force is DOMINE DIRIGE NOS  (God guides us). I would like it to remain this way.",Catholicism

"Why continue to use labels like ""novus ordo"", ""NO"", ""TLM"", etc?",StrivingEvermore,1626775282,"Without a doubt, Pope Benedict XVI is a deep-thinker. A very deep thinker. When he crafted *Summorum Pontificum* it's clear he was sensitive to how people would react to it -- particularly when it came to the implementation of the Tridentine Mass.

In that light he gave us the monikers Ordinary Form of the Mass (OF Mass) to describe the Mass of Pope Paul VI and the Extraordinary Form of the Mass (EF Mass) to describe the Tridentine Mass. I remember thinking how wonderful that was.

It was also clear that he encouraged the use of these ""neutral/non-offensive"" labels, thought he did not make their use mandatory (not that it would likely have helped things.) 

**Whether they're accurate or not, whether you believe they are inherently offensive or not**, labels like ""novus ordo"", ""NO"", ""TLM"", etc. have become offensive to many. Including to me, in part because most users didn't seem to be able to find the grace to follow Benedict's lead.

While I don't personally agree with Francis' current behavior and I believe that  *Traditionis Custodes* will one day be quietly swept aside during a coming pontificate, I do think that continued aggressive use of labels like ""novus ordo"", ""NO"", ""TLM"", etc., at the very least helped to provide cover for Francis' recent activity.

So I honestly ask the question. Why not stick to the Benedictine monikers of Ordinary Form of the Mass (OF Mass) to describe the Mass of Paul VI and the Extraordinary Form of the Mass (EF Mass) to describe the Tridentine Mass? 

Why continue to use labels that offend others -- a great many others **even if they are accurate, or even if you feel they shouldn't offend anyone,** when Benedict XVI provided excellent options? Thanks.",Catholicism

"I'm an atheist and very seriously interested in Christianity, Catholic church and it's history. Anyone willing to talk to me and answer a few questions?",flourishersvk,1626771629,"Hey everyone. 

I'm really sorry if this isn't the right place to ask about these things. A brief introduction: I'm a 25 years old man working as a nurse. I do think a lot about things happening around me which is one of the reasons I'm here today. I say I'm an atheist but technically I was baptized as a kid in protestant church. Though I do believe that it's what you hold inside you that makes you Christian (or any other religion) which I don't posses. Yet still recently I became very interested in Christianity, Catholic church and it's history. I live in a very religious country and sadly I had negative experience trying to talk about these things with some people. Also I met some priests that were openly rude towards me or other people too. But still I do believe that when you have something as big as Catholic church you can't avoid having a few bad apples. 

If there's someone willing to have a longer conversation with me shoot me a PM. If not here's a few things I'm interested in:

1. Overall I'm looking for any good material (in any form) on history of Catholic church and it's basic structure. How it's organized, how it works etc. 

2. This is gonna be a bit controversial so I'm sorry. While many atheists don't care and respect what other people believe in. There's a common negativity towards Catholic church. I hear a lot of opinions like how the Vatican is so wealthy and won't help it's people while it keeps hoarding wealth. Why churches rely on gifts from poor people (at least here it works that way). And often also that religion slows down technical and medical advancement for the whole planet.  I'd just love to hear how you as a Catholic address these things and maybe if you point me to interviews or books where priests, bishops etc address these things. 

3. I'm a nurse I know how our bodies work and I don't see any space for a soul or anything like that. Now that's just me, there's much smarter people than me. People who know way more and understand the physics and chemistry behind life on earth and yet still believe in God. My question is. How do you, in these days when we can explain almost everything trough science, find your faith in God? In the past I did try to believe but this is where I always hit a brick wall. 

In the end I'd love to add one thing. Even if I don't believe in God I do have a big respect so far for many priests that are there to help people. I know many people turn to religion in time of need and Catholic churches over here are almost always open for those people. Which is something really beautiful and amazing.",Catholicism

It’s gotten to the point where 70% of my day is focused on past sins and whether or not they were mortal or veinal. And only 2% is focusing on how merciful, gracious, and loving God is. I want these to flip. I had a confession the other day (after 8 years of no confession) and I am 99.99% sure I confessed a sin that was very embarrassing. But my mind keeps wondering if I’m truly forgiven or if I even confessed it (like my mind is convincing me I didn’t confess it even though I did). I feel like this is causing me to lose my faith in God and his forgiveness. It’s starting to become no longer about repenting because of how bad I felt for hurting God, but more about repenting everything so I feel better and not anxious. This is truly taking a toll on me. I want to have faith again. But my anxiety and OCD is truly preventing this. Please, if you have any advice please let me know. Please pray for me as well. I want to have a relationship with God so bad but I feel like I’m preventing myself.",Catholicism

lost in religon and children (raising),Zenedar,1626759289,"I have always considered myself as as Catholic.

However during covid I have been estranged from my church, and have moved from several states (US) away.  Right before I married the love of my live (leap year 2020[form 3]).  

After coming back and moving in with her I no longer came to mass (Covid).  I am still a believer, however her family has been part of a very free will Baptist group out of the very deep south. 

We always have planned on marriage toward kids, and based on the advise of my mother (convert after marriage).  I am reluctant to force any religion on either party.  She is not baptized, however does not have any objection for a catholic baptism to occur.

However,  my biggest wish for us is to all get a long. She has already said that if I forced her to convert she would (forcing sounds bad).

That sounded like the best plan. (I was worried about her family).  Supporting sounded to be the best option.

This is only one of several issues we are facing in terms of child (I am named after my dad which both us hate the idea of a III of my name, maybe every other generation). 
We both work consistently are we are planning to try for a child this year.

Any advice to this would be great.  I had to rely on my favorite priest to help us secure a Form 3 wedding.

The hilarious part is we have moved from a heavily free-will Baptist community to a dominant catholic area.

On my list of things to do currently is to meet with my local priest to introduce myself (long to streamwatcher never met), and discuss solutions that would both suit us.  My main issue is not trying to step on any toes, since we both believe in our savior and follow roughly the same ideals.",Catholicism

[Politics Monday] On why despite becoming a Catholic I still vote Democrat and I don't feel particularly uncomfortable with it.,sneedsformerlychucks,1626751385," You don't have to read this if you don't want, but this is a perspective you rarely if ever read here so I thought I would share it. 

 Even if I generally agreed with all the policies of the Republican party, more than half of the party at this point has embraced a conspiratorial and borderline psychotic worldview in which a completely legitimate election was ""stolen"" from them and an unacceptably large portion have actively borrowed rhetoric and beliefs from the Qanon conspiracy theory. At least when I disagree with Democrats, and lately I disagree with them a lot, it's because I think their interpretation of the world is wrong, even really, deeply wrong, rather than because they're knowingly lying in an attempt to start a right-wing revolution and destroy the institutions that underpin our society, which if anything seems fundamentally un-conservative.

If I'm told, even on the basis of the great evil of abortion, that I still either have to vote for Republicans or vote for a third party that indirectly helps them win, I frankly don't know if I want to be a Catholic if that's the sacrifice I have to make. Others have made their own calculus that they can only vote for pro life candidates no matter how corrupt they are and that's their decision. But it seems unfair to state, unilaterally, that it is indefensible from a Catholic viewpoint to vote for Biden when the Pope has openly congratulated Biden, hesitates to criticize him despite his heretical policies, likes to criticize Trump at any given opportunity and has generally made it clear that if he were an American citizen and wanted to vote he would have voted for Biden. This is independent from the question of whether Biden is a good Catholic (the answer, of course, is no). 

If I were completely honest, I'd say if I genuinely saw each individual instance of abortion no matter the circumstance as both intellectually and emotionally as equivalent to a senseless drive-by massacre, as many people on this subreddit do, I'd be more inclined to vote Republican no matter what (I'd also probably want to bomb the next abortion clinic I see and hate every other woman I meet because I have to wonder whether they had an abortion). But from my standpoint I think I'm not required to. I have several philosophical and ethics-based reasons for thinking this, primarily based on intent. But I agree that life begins at conception and that abortion is fundamentally morally wrong and that is what my faith requires of me. 

On another note, I don't even think I'm especially theologically liberal.  I don't think this subreddit needs to welcome ""progressive Catholic"" opinions, e.g. pro-choice or pro-gay marriage. In fact, I'm happy it doesn't. You can go to r/Christianity if you want to read those things. But I feel like in the attempt to maintain orthodoxy, this subreddit has gone too far in the other direction and adopted a worldview that is very grossly unrepresentative of Catholicism in the real world. While it might be justifiable to be alienating to the average, poorly catechized lay person, I would go farther and say that even to the average person in the clergy a lot of this content is alienating. Furthermore, it tends to conflate liberal political opinions with liberal theological opinions. I have tried to argue before that liberal democracy and freedom of speech are generally good things, and gotten criticism for that because it's un-Catholic not to be an integralist I guess? Can't say I understand that. I don't think outside of this subreddit those would be considered heretical opinions, and in fact they are rather mainstream. But yeah, when I'm seeing that certain sociopolitical movements like feminism are routinely dismissed out of hand by calling them Marxist, when in fact there are many Catholic women who identify as feminists while adhering to church teaching and doctrine, I can't help but think that some people are not really hearing out anybody who deviates from political views considered traditionalist in good faith. (To be clear, I'm not saying that all forms of feminism are church-compatible because obviously, many are not. But feminism is a very broad category.)",Catholicism

"The case for Genetics, Evolution in Genesis 30:37?",Heartbeat1215,1626750765,"I’m Catholic so I take much of the Old Testament both literally and figuratively.  It seems the books have more truth and relevance this way.  So, rereading the Old Testament I was taken aback by Genesis 30:37.

Just throwing ideas out there, but if you see the book of Genesis as God’s plan, including Jesus Christ as the Messiah, then the section of Jacob taking an unwanted group of goats, lambs and sheep and nurturing them until they become greater than the former prized sheep is very symbolic of God’s Plan.

Keep in mind Jacob takes the “ugly” live stock that is black or spotted for his own, while still tending the pure white flock of his relative and master.  The ugly stock through proper tending becomes the more fruitful.  Well, this is how I’ve always seen religion as God through the Holy Spirit tending for those of us who would be considered unwanted.  

So, I thought I would point that out.  I can go further and elaborate with Essau and Edom but that’s it for now.


Genesis 30:37

37 Then Jacob [z]took fresh rods of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white that was [aa]in the rods. 38 He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the drinking troughs, that is, in the watering channels where the flocks came to drink; and they mated when they came to drink. 39 So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks delivered striped, speckled, and spotted offspring. 40 Then Jacob separated the lambs, and [ab]made the flocks face toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with Laban’s flock. 41 Moreover, whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the drinking troughs, so that they would mate by the rods; 42 but when the flock was sickly, he did not put them in; so the sickly were Laban’s, and the stronger were Jacob’s. 43 So the man [ac]became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.",Catholicism

The Gift of the Liturgical Reform,CheerfulErrand,1626749220,"Since everyone is debating the various forms of the Mass, I thought I'd share an analysis that many of you probably haven't seen, exploring what exactly changed *for the good* in the revised Mass. 

[The Gift of the Liturgical Reform](https://www.hprweb.com/2020/01/the-gift-of-the-liturgical-reform/)

Some quotes:

&gt;One of the most important changes mandated by Vatican II was the biblical enrichment of the Mass. Over the centuries the readings had become biblically impoverished. Prior to Vatican II, there were only two readings for each Sunday; most weekday Masses simply repeated the Sunday readings or used those of feasts, rituals, or votive Masses. On saints’ days, the same readings were used again and again, for instance, the parable of the ten virgins on feasts of virgins. There was no continuous reading of a biblical book from day to day or week to week. In all, only 16% of the New Testament appeared in the Mass, and *a mere 1% of the Old Testament*. The virtual absence of the Hebrew Scriptures easily lends itself to a view of Jesus and the Church detached from their Jewish roots. And the fact that all the readings are disconnected excerpts, jumping from passage to passage seemingly at random, makes it more difficult for people to grasp the overarching unity of God’s plan.  
&gt;  
&gt;The reformed liturgy, in contrast, provides the faithful with a rich banquet of the Word. The new three-year cycle for the Sunday lectionary and two-year cycle for the daily lectionary allow for a much broader selection of biblical passages. The faithful who attend daily Mass now hear 72% of the New Testament and 14% of the Old Testament, and even Sunday Mass alone offers more than three times as much Scripture as in the older missal (41% of the New Testament, 4% of the Old). Each Sunday Gospel is paired with a related Old Testament passage, which helps instill in the hearers the ancient understanding of the spiritual sense — the magnificent way all God’s words and deeds in the old covenant prefigure, prophesy, and prepare for the fullness of his plan in Christ.

\[. . .\]

&gt;For similar reasons, Vatican II called for greater use of the vernacular in the Mass. The fact that this practice was quickly adopted by bishops’ conferences around the world, with approval from Rome, is not a sign of infidelity to tradition but rather of an instinct of faith. In Christ, God has become one of us and made himself utterly accessible. He speaks to us in human words that we can understand, and we can in turn worship and pray to him in our own language. “The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart” (Rom 10:8). Nothing can take the place of a person’s mother tongue in enabling him or her to pray to God intimately, from the heart.

\[. . .\]

&gt;The pastoral effect of *ad orientem* is also not insignificant. The effect, even if unintended, is to distance the people from the central liturgical action. They cannot see the elements on the altar. The fulcrum of the Mass, the consecration, is invisible (and often inaudible) to the congregation, thereby losing much of its value as a sacramental *sign*. For many people, this inevitably contributes to the sense of being bystanders rather than active participants in the liturgy.  
&gt;  
&gt;The *versus populum* position is sometimes inaccurately described as facing “away from God.” Of course, this is not the case: God is everywhere, and to face any direction in prayer is to face him — all the more so when one is facing the body and blood of Christ, as both priest and congregation do when the Eucharist is on the altar between them.

Question about baptism,KateTheStraightedge,1626748883,"Hello all,

First I swear I am not a troll, I just want some much needed feedback for a question I have had for years

To start I am not Catholic, however my Mother and my Mother's family is. She often laments over the fact I was was never baptised, in part due to the fact my Father was not comfortable with baptising someone who could not consent to it. Once i was older I attended a Lutheran Church, but ultimately left  because I am not straight and the leaders of the church were less than kind to people like me (I never came out to them for that reason.) 

My mother truely and honestly believes that we will be seperated eternally because I was never baptised. I know it weighs in her. My mother is getting older and I don't want her to worry, however I am not sure what I can do. I love my mother and want her to have every comfort I can provide, but I do not share her beilefs. As hard as I try to understand the bible, and as many times as I have prayed for it to make sense, It doesn't. The only answer I have ever gotten is be a kind person who tries to do right by others and hope God sees I'm really trying.

On a few occations my mom has begged me to be baptised in the catholic church. She is angry that I am not baptised because I am longer Christian. While I have no objections to being baptised, am not sure what church would baptise me knowing I do not have the intent to be a practicing member of the faith, and do not believe in the bible. 
My friends have told me to just tell the church and say i want to be catholic so I can get baptised and my mom can stop worrying, but lying is wrong, and I won't lie, esspecially not to get  what my mom has discribed as a ticket to heaven.

I have a question about the morality of abortion in select circumstances.,kuhchunck,1626742916,"So slight back story... I am a cradle Catholic. We went to mass weekly and we're fairly active in the Church. About the time I was to be confirmed some events took place that caused my family to drift from the Church. I never got confirmed. I then went through my teenage rebellion which lasted through most of my twenties. I was a pretty radical liberal. I have since 180° right back around, returned to the Church with a family of my own and have now gravitated to some pretty traditional beliefs. I am still pretty ignorant about a lot of the doctrine but I am learning and trying to make up for over a decade lost. The rest of my family (other than one brother) are all Catholic to varying degrees.

On to the question. I still grapple with a lot of my old liberal views. On the topic of abortion, I know it is wrong and I know where the Church stands (obviously). I know in the instance of rape/incest, what the morally right thing to do is although I struggle with it. In the case of an unviable baby, I struggle with forcing (morally or legally) the mother to carry to term. I do know where the Church stands on the issue though, and I pray to God that I should never be in the position or be counsel to someone in those positions. 

Where I really struggle though is in the case of the mother's health. In cases where carrying to term would kill the mother. Cases like preeclampsia and others. I don't mean aborting a viable baby but when it is early enough that the baby wouldn't survive without the mother's womb but continuing to carry the baby could kill the mother. I believe the mother's life should be valued and we shouldn't doom both because we don't want to kill one. I have had the debate with other Catholics mostly back before I returned to the Church and it seemed to me the consensus was ALL abortion is evil. But in the case where we can save one life are we not obligated to save it? I feel it's a bit like the train dilemma. 

So what is the answer? I don't feel I could talk to my priest about it as it's not exactly a pressing issue for me, more just a question.",Catholicism

I'm still in this fight.,eeriewanderer,1626742355,"Alright guys I am deeply lost on the truth behind this matter. Apparently it's a sin to masterbate, I've been doing this ever since I was 12. I never watched porn up until I was in my late Sophomore year. Until then I was only masterbating 2 times a week, AND THAT WAS IT. Keep in mind I felt really guilty for doing this all the while. My parents are really devoted Catholics and so they've instilled the same exact values in me, if not more. Including a deep respect for recieving Communion with a pure conscience.  So my get-up got so bad I was going to Confessions very frequently, confessing I was beating off just so I could go and recieve Communion the following Sunday. And most Fathers literally had the same to little to no advice for me. I don't blame them. I would've thought the same thing. ""Oh this is very f**** awkward, I'm really gonna try and stop this time around."" But I never found a way, as the years passed, I began beating off on a daily basis. It's gotten so bad that I am jerking off More than a couple times a day whenever I get a chance (using porn of course). I admit I've sort of lost the value in doing this, but at the same time I find the sensation unbeatable. I feel enslaved, a stupid animal. My whole life I was always very reserved, even towards my own friends. I was terrible to even have a simple conversation with, I always felt uneasy around anybody, friends or family or simple classmates. I also had very mixed feelings and hung around the wrong crowd (friends). After high school I joined the military and since then Thank God I have finally broken through my shell and am a much more out going person; I've even met some incredible people along whom I am proud to call friends. But I have also stopped going to church entirely. I've even debated contradicting ideas towards the church. The very last time I confessed this ""sin"" me watching porn, beating off was not too long ago. And I was really trying to make an effort to start going to Mass on a weekly basis again, but this last Father, I could tell in the tone of his voice, he only told me a 10 Hail Mary penance but I could only assume he was thinking, ""well wow this nasty SOB. He really has took audacity today ."" Since then I've vowed to never confess this again because on a personal level, yeah this is getting pretty retarded and embarrassing. I tried to go to Mass the next day but I had no confidence in going anymore because I knew I was bound to fall back into the same habits again. I'm done playing this cycle, it's getting in the way of how I want to rebuild my life again. The only thing that makes me keep my bridge with the Lord is faith alone. But I fear this will dwindle as well. What am I supposed to do? Abstaining from long to short periods at a time didn't work. The smallest thoughts, inclination, picture (you name it) well get me going at any place public or private. I've grown really used it, without fear, without a sense of morality on the matter. I want to treat it like it's not a sin at this point. That it's just part of our physical nature. I've had my shots at getting a girlfriend during high school but could never keep one because of how mentally distraught I was. It's even harder to cope with it since in the military because it's mainly brothers and away from society. Have I been dwelling in my own puke this whole time and I should just man up and manifest myself. Like papa used to say. Or should I really not take this seriously? Ladies and gentlemen it's 2021, the world, America is increasingly decadent, even more looking for another fellow with the same background as myself. People literally fuck each other like dogs on the street. Everyone cheats, everyone divorces, every one always has sex with somebody. I want to curse this world, I want to give up, and live my life and die like a tree and not believe in the possibility of Eternal Life existing. I don't even plan on getting married anymore, I feel as if it would be easier that way. Please someone point me in the right direction, I am addicted to sex or/and pornography. I want this topic settled, I cannot defeat this sin, it's literally what caused my dowfall.

Speculative question.,Uninterrupted-Void,1626739769,"If I could assemble a machine, let's not call it a computer. Let's call it an ""artificial brain"", because although pop culture says brains are computers, they are not normal computers.

Here are the characteristics of the artificial brain.

1: It is not made of flesh or any living constituents, it is silicon.

2: however it is made, it is made to resemble a human brain in all the ways that ""count"", when it comes to rationality, sensation, etc. Whatever those are. Maybe it will have senses we don't. Maybe it will lack senses we have. But it will be designed the way ours are when it comes to the important stuff.

If a scientist tried doing this, would there be any real chance that God would endow it with a rational soul at the instant I turn on the electricity for the first time?

Is digital piracy immoral?,unclerudy,1626739697,"Is downloading a digital copy of something without paying for it considered immoral? Is it considered stealing? Normally stealing is taking something that is not yours, against the will of the owner, and depriving them of the object so they can no longer use or have it. That is definitely immoral, and the 10 commandments specifically states ""Thou shall not steal"".  However with digital piracy, nothing is deprived from the owner, and they still have access for use whenever wanted.  The original owner might have paid for it, and so the creator was compensated for their work.  If the person who does the digital piracy only did it for personal use, and didn't do it to profit off of the digital item, would that be considered stealing? You could argue that every digital copy of something that is pirated is a loss of income for the creator, so the pirate is stealing, but you could counter that argument that the pirate might have never purchased the digital product ever, so no money was lost and it is not stealing.

So is digital piracy stealing, and therefore immoral?",Catholicism

Today is her Post-Op day 1 and she has refused to drink or eat, has vomited three times, and seems to be in so much pain. I powdered up some Tramadol and rubbed it on her gums and it seemed to help her sleep a little while. I'm scared I made the wrong decision to make her have surgery. She was fine and her usual happy, friendly self until yesterday when she had the tumor removed. I'm scared I've hastened the end of her life by trying to get more time with her. I feel awful. She's the one dog I've had in my life that I have that unbreakable bond with, like The Starks and their Direwolves. In fact, I often refer to her as my direwolf.

Why isn’t everyone Christian?,NelehRellek_,1626734865,"Hi everyone. I converted to Catholicism a good two years ago but since then I’ve always had this one question and can never seem to find a plausible answer. So I know that In the Old Testament, the people of Israel were the chosen people and God only really communicated with them. I always felt this was strange, why would God prefer one group to another and only give instructions to the people of Israel in how to be holy. So this supposedly ended with the coming of Jesus but a similar thing ended up happening. For centuries only Europe and part of the Middle East was Christian while most of the world was pagan or a different religion. Why would God only introduce the faith to a certain group of people.

Adult Baptism,wanderlust_er,1626732977,"Hi!

I was born &amp; raised in a devoutly Catholic family. My grandma taught Sunday school, my mom &amp; all my aunts did as well, and it was expected I’d follow in that line, too.

I was baptized and did my 1st communion as a kid.


I paused being so unconsciously Catholic when I grew into my mid and late teens. I had many questions and found that some of  my beliefs had shifted away from the staunch Catholic views. Not surprisingly I also discovered and slowly began to embrace my lesbian sexuality. 




It took years, but I came back to the fait. On my own terms. I was able to reconcile what I grew up being taught were two incompatible worlds- being Catholic and being gay. I still loved the Lord and found my way back, realizing that He didn’t spout hate, some of his followers did.



I went back to church and enjoyed mass again. I went back in my early 20s out of my own desire to do my confirmation. I had also started dating and found it to be a beautiful thing that finally made sense. I also happened to meet another woman who loved the Lord. I was over the moon. There were others out there like me! I didn’t think I’d meet someone who loved the Lord and going to mass, but I did. For reasons, our time together ended, but it brightened the hole in me that I’d find a partner in Christ.



I’ve been with my current partner for 4.5 years. My partner is transgender, born female and identifies as male and loves his life as such. He was also raised Catholic, and like me left the faith he was raised in due to the homophobia. I told him early on in our relationship that I wanted to be with someone who believes in God and would participate in church activities with me, non-negotiable.



He has since opened up to our faith again and after a few years wants to participate more. He was never baptized, but wants to continue to learn more about the Lord and get baptized, do his communion, get confirmed, and other Catholic practices.



I’m excited for him and for us. I advised he get his legal name change and new birth certificate to reflect his identity before formally entering the church to avoid unnecessary complications.


I’d just like some support. Thank you.",Catholicism

In my opinion, the old line is much clearer for the praying Catholic. ""Consubstantial"" sticks out like a sore thumb. We have already anglicized so many words in our prayers, and for good reason:

* omnipotent -&gt; almighty
* the infernos -&gt; hell
* remission -&gt; forgiveness
* debts -&gt; trespasses
* through omission -&gt; in what I have failed to do

Cradle catholics tell horror stories about the lack of catechesis they receive growing up. The concept of mortification never came up in my RCIA class. I've heard dangerous advice in the confessional teaching religious indifferentism and I rarely hear a call to repentance in a homily.

On Christopher Hitchens,TheKingsPeace,1626723143,"I just bought Christopher Hitchens “ book of essays” the other day. 

He, as you all were aware was one of the “ four horse men” of the atheist movement.

He had been a columnist with vanity fair/ slate since the 80s but only really sky rocketed to fame in maybe the final 5 years of his life.

He spent those five final years arguing against Gods existence and gaining the applause of millions of immature and influence led millennials in the process.

I used to like him a lot but now he makes me sad. He just strikes me as a person of great intellect and wry wit who applied it to no great or meaningful cause in particular. 

He seemed almost suicidal in his health habits, being an impenitent smoker and consuming perhaps a quart  of hard liquor daily, before inevitably getting esophageal cancer.

I sense some wierd loneliness and sorrow from him, seeking about the preachers and priests he professes to despise to debate their beliefs with them. 

All before slowly waisting away from a painful and expensive ordeal probably fighting fears and doubts of the afterlife as the grim reaper strode ever closer. I’d like to think he prayed for gods forgiveness as he died but we see no evidence of that.

I'm not necessarily against everything the show does, like I think it's fine to do unpolitically correct humor or shock humor. But honestly, as a Catholic, I don't enjoy all the sex, violence, and vulgar humor in South Park and shows like it. Sex is so prevelent on TV today that I'm just used to skipping it, especially when it does little to nothing for the plot and doesn't happen a lot, but the harder thing to ignore or skip is all the gore and violence. 

Not only that but shows like South Park can also be quite blasphemous or sacreligous. Like if I remember correctly they had an episode where Jesus condoned drugs, which clearly goes against Church teaching and the Bible. And there was another episode where I'm pretty sure they violently killed clergy of the Catholic Church which in my personal opinion no Catholic should watch nor find funny.

Two days ago (17th) I was married to the love of my life and it was all perfect, the service and reception. However, hour before the end of the reception, she suffered a stroke. Luckily there were several doctors and nurses attending and so we were able to rush her to the hospital. She is much better now, with little lasting effects besides a slight lisp and her right side of her body being a little weaker. We have agreed that she'll be transfered to a new hospital for intense physical therapy at a place that excelled in Comprehensive stroke care. I feel beyond blessed that she is mostly unharmed, and that she should heal great.

This being said, the problem comes with her prescribed medication. The doctors mentioned that she will probably have to take an aspirin and Lipitor to help with her blood. Lipitor is suppose to be one of best medications for this, however pregnant women shouldn't take it. The doctor mentioned that when we wanted to get pregnant, we'd need to take to him about getting her off it. This much is fine. The problem is that at the moment we are both still virgins (do to the stroke, we could consumate on the wedding night). Given Catholic teaching on sex and being open to having kids I'm left conflicted.

Letter to a Friend,ChicagoCath89,1626711786,"Good article from The Lamp magazine:

https://www.thelampmagazine.com/2021/07/17/letter-to-a-friend/

“For my part I can’t help thinking that this would all be so much easier if we just knew less. The people who know less today have such an easy way out of this pain. For example, imagine if we did not know the traditional Mass at all, if we did not know these vigils and octaves and Ember Days, these mode-VII graduals and mode-II tracts, the prayers at the foot of the altar and the Last Gospel and the Leonine prayers. If we had never experienced this, or at least if we hadn’t lived it from the inside for all these years, we could write this off as just another political move—good or bad, depending on our priors, but nothing too personal. We would not know what was really at issue. It would not hurt like this.

Or imagine, at the other extreme, if we did not know the divine constitution of our ecclesiastical hierarchy. The nutjobs who think that the pope is not the pope have it easy too, as do those who think that Vatican II was fraudulent or a plot rather than a pastoral council. They get to console themselves that today changes nothing. If anything, they feel vindicated by it, and they’ll keep defying the Church and her prelates with reckless abandon just as they’ve been doing for years (or since they woke up and decided they wanted their own rad-trad grifter blogs the day before yesterday, depending). But they’re wrong, and we have the emotional misfortune of knowing it. The pope is in fact the pope, and his authority is from God. But this is not going to be easy.

You and I don’t have the convenient escape route of ignorance. We know too much: Prime and trattoria napkins and the Vidi Aquam and the Chartres Pilgrimage, Matthew 16:18 and Hebrews 13:17 and St. Denys’ eighth epistle and Pope Boniface’s Unam sanctam.

Were talking life changing.

I know that everything falls short of God's glory and that there is no expectation for us to sacrifice great things to show thanks. 

However, I reached out to the Catholic thread because Catholics seem to have a stronger relationship with the sacred and maintain rituals that symbolically represent things of importance. 

My question is then, are there ways to give thanks to God that may not translate to a literally greater offering of thanks but by going through some ritual or different mode of prayer beyond just kneeling in your quiet place would signify , the effort with which you went through to do, would be representative and more reflective of your great appreciation for the blessings before you? My apologies for the ultimate wordy question.

Politicians and Recreational Marijuana [Politics Monday],AggravatingBeat8,1626708246,"I've looked around online a fair bit trying to educate myself on the Catholic ethical view on marijuana use, and the prevailing trend seems to be that medicinal use is ok but recreational use is gravely wrong. I had been under the impression that it was wrong solely because it was illegal, because there's been a fair bit of effort at rehabilitating marijuana's public image as something closer to alcohol and tobacco than to ""hard drugs,"" nor has there been much--some but not much--in the way of Catholics speaking out against recreational marijuana.

I suppose my question is: if even moderate use of marijuana is wrong, can a Catholic politician still in good conscience support--even as a concession, as opposed personal support--the legalization of recreational marijuana? And if not, does this rise to the level of manifest grave sin in the same way that life issues do? To clarify: I'm not talking decriminalization or medical use.",Catholicism

Particular Judgment and Last Judgment,sonofdurinwastaken,1626707089,"The *Catechism* says in paragraph 1021:
&gt;Each man receives his eternal retribution in his immortal soul at the very moment of his death, in a particular judgment that refers his life to Christ: either entrance into the blessedness of heaven—through a purification or immediately—or immediate and everlasting damnation. 

Then in paragraph 1038, we read:
&gt;The resurrection of all the dead, of both the just and the unjust, will precede the Last Judgment. This will be the hour when all who are in the tombs will hear the Son of man’s voice and come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment. Then Christ will come in his glory and all the angels with him….Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he will place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left….And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. 


So here is my question: if everyone is judged at the moment of their death, who will be left in the tombs of the earth to receive the Last Judgment? Won’t everyone have had their judgment already? Can the Last Judgment overrule the Particular Judgment?",Catholicism
Worshipping and Emotional Highs,princessp15,1626705952,"One of the things I have experienced since I was young was ""emotional highs"" when I really get into worship. I have always thought of this as a good thing, and as if I can feel the Holy Spirit. Lots of times pastors will say they can ""feel the Holy Spirit"" in there, and I assume that is this feeling. 

But I read a comment on here the other day about the danger of this feeling. Worshipping God shouldn't be about chasing that emotional high, which is what I think a lot of folks do. I think they do it with good intentions, but the point should be praising God, whether we get that high or not. I feel like so many people associate true worship with that feeling and waver in church attendance because they don't get it every time they go. 

Sometimes when I do the Lord's work, I get this feeling and can't help but almost want to ""chase"" it. Our VBS has been this week and I do the worship songs with the kids. One kid in particular was non-verbal before the pandemic (last time I saw him) and came back to church a couple months ago able to speak and was so sweet and proud of himself (he started school and was put in speech classes). I find myself thinking and praying for him lately - and just praising God for him having found help. When I do things like that, I get that ""emotional high"" type feeling and try to keep praying/praising as long as possible (as long as I can think of intentional things to pray about, but I can tell when I'm coming down from the high). 

For another type of example, lots of times (maybe every time?) when I find myself intentionally choosing ""good"" over ""not good"" and do it intentionally for God, I get a good feeling. Not necessarily an emotional high, but sort of like a ""pat-on-the-back"" type thing. I have invited people to church before and been met with negative and upsetting responses - even though I think I'm doing the Lord's work, I don't get that good feeling. 

I'm sure all Christian's have these experiences. I would like to hear a Catholic's perspective on this, as I was raised Protestant. In my experience, revivals invoke these feelings. I know worship is NOT about how I feel, it's about praising God. When I go to Mass, I do feel like I'm worshipping, but I really don't feel that high (I cannot take part in the Eucharist yet). I definitely feel closer to God there, though, versus my Protestant church, and I do believe I'm worshipping with good intentions (as in I don't feel complacent). 

Am I thinking too hard into this? I have never heard anyone really talk about it... but I feel like it's very real.",Catholicism

Thoughts from an OF Parish Priest on the Motu Proprio,LongLivePippen,1626703807,"This past week, Pope Francis published a document all-but-banning the Traditional Latin Mass (TLM)...

Many priests and experts and holy people have written their analyses online. Most of these essays provide historical context and then take a predictable side. Some (who clearly don't attend the TLM) have added ""positive"" comments about how TLM people can find Sunday Masses with the reverence or music or liturgical style they crave... But that's exactly where the misunderstanding lies... 

The question here is not about taste or style. It's not even about reverence at Mass or which form of the Mass is objectively better in achieving some purpose. I love the Old Mass but I'm not a fan of the Latin language. I don't have any particular affection for this or that detail of the Old Mass. My love for it has zero to do with style. 

The real drama lies in a kind of de facto schizophrenia in the Catholic Church since the mid-20th century. Catholicism has a lot of what an outsider might call paradoxes at its center... Our God is 3 AND 1. Jesus is God AND Man. Our religion is supernatural AND very much worldly. Our religious worship is divine AND human. Our worldview is oriented toward eternity, but it's also localized here and now. That's one of the most fascinating things about the adventure of the Catholic Faith.

Beginning in the 1960s, though, there was a strong movement among the clergy to emphasize certain aspects of the Faith and to deemphasize others. Suddenly sermons and Catholic magazines stopped talking about God's divinity and focused almost entirely on Jesus' presence among us. Suddenly, ""you get out of Mass what you put into it!"" became a mantra among pastoral workshops and teachers. The duty that we have to offer worship was replaced by a near-idolatry of ""active participation."" The parish sign and bulletin changed overnight to refer to the parish not as a ""Church"" but as a ""loving community of Faith."" There are plenty of other examples. 

On the surface, that's just a shift in emphasis and it happens in any living, organic religion.  But as the emphasis shifted, the de-emphasized parts became more and more excluded to the point that anyone who mentioned one's moral duty was considered out of touch or out of date. The phase ""pre-Vatican-II"" became an ordinary part of Church vocabulary. Much of this happened very, very quickly and there was a general enthusiasm for the change, at least among the clergy. It was the 60s! But this is where the schizophrenia comes in. Ordinary parts of the Catholic Faith were now being shadow-banned and the teachings of spiritual masters like Ignatius of Loyola or St. Jean Vianney were now being dismissed as faulty because they were ""pre-Vatican-II."" And just like with modern politics, no one was allowed to ask where the goalposts were and those goalposts could be moved at any moment just by invoking ""the Spirit of Vatican II.""

In 1996, I was a teenager reading a biography of St. Ignatius of Loyola at my parish's LifeTeen center. The pastor - a really great, personable priest, Fr. Vic - walked by and noticed my book. We chatted for a second and I said ""It would be awesome to go to Mass like St. Ignatius did, in Spanish!"" 😬 Fr. Vic said, ""it would have been in Latin, not Spanish."" So I asked hopefully, ""Oh! can you do that? Could you say a Mass for us in Latin like Ignatius would've heard?"" Fr. Vic's reaction was almost Satanic: ""I WOULD NEVER SAY MASS IN LATIN!"" and stormed off. Honestly, that moment remains seminal for me in my religious journey... What was the big deal about Latin? Why was this simple, earnest request so offensive? How could something which was sacred for St. Ignatius be un-sacred or evil for us?

By the mid-1980s, it was clear that there were big problems in the Church. Huge numbers of priests and nuns were abandoning their vocations. Seminaries and confessionals were empty. People were leaving the Church in droves. Older folks were horrified to see their adult children walk away from the Church without any concern for their salvation. Those who remained and the few who converted were living in a kind of religious minefield. Depending on your priest, your parish was either very devotional or very social-justice-y. You could hear a sermon one weekend that contradicted the sermon last weekend. The associate pastor might tell you to read what Pope John Paul had just written while the pastor would decry the Pope as anachronistic and tell you to read the magazines (and only the magazines) he put in the back of the Church. (A priest friend of mine was chewed out by his pastor for giving children a holy card and a penny catechism when they made the honor roll at the school.)

Traditional communities provided a continuity that the mainstream Church struggled to offer. In the mid-1990s, traditional Catholic communities came into their own and began to turn out relatively large numbers of seminarians and nuns. After Pope Benedict opened wide the doors to the Old Mass in 2007, these communities immediately began to flourish around the US and now provide a wildly disproportionate number of seminarians. 

These communities thrive because the whole experience of the liturgy, the sermons, and the complete picture of Catholicism is unified, coherent, and consistent - both intellectually and historically. Even today, many Catholic parishes function as a kind of cult of personality around the pastor. Even those priests who actively resist it end up defining the life of the parish by their own personalities. I honestly don't know why that doesn't happen in traditional communities. I suppose it could, given time... But, in my experience, traditional communities are defined far more by the lay members than by the clergy. My brother priests and I discuss often how to resist making the parish overly reliant on me as the pastor. It's a shockingly hard problem to solve. That internal schizophrenia remains as real today as ever. Catholics still move from one parish to the other trying to find a priest and a Mass which makes them feel close to the Lord. Catholic still shop around for a priest to challenge them or coddle them in the confessional. Priests and bishops publicly disagree about basic matters of morality and dogma online and from the pulpit... This particular drama is still playing out today.

Now, we have to be honest, there are many reasons that traditional communities have thrived in the US in the past fifteen years. Some of them have nothing to do with the Missal of 1962. But without question, the Mass of the Ages has been the primary factor. It's not about style or the Latin Language or being a 'radTrad' or about disunity... It's about the clarity and consistency of Faith and the way that everything just fits together. We also have to be honest and say that not all traditional communities or traditionally-minded people are alike.  There are toxic communities and toxic people. There are angry and bitter people. There are exclusionary communities. Religion isn't magic and faith can be misused and abused. But these 'radtrads' and 'sedevacantists' are the exception, not the rule. The rule is large, homeschooling families. The rule is pious, devotional people who take Mass and their lives of Faith beyond it seriously. They dress up. They're attentive. They're generous with their time and their funds. The traditional communities with which I've been affiliated are universally accepting, excited, young, and passionate. They have been incredibly life-giving to me as a layperson and, now, as a priest.

As such, I'm personally devastated by the Holy Father's decision.

Not because it directly affects me or my parish... I have a lovely Church and a wonderful community of people. There's not much interest in the TLM here that that's fine. In many ways, St. Edward is exceptional in the best possible way... Still, this news from the Holy Father is devastating. So many priests are texting and calling to share sad stories of having to tell people - especially converts, immigrants, and young people - that their Mass has been canceled. It's a hard and painful moment. I'm consoled by the words of Our Lady at Fatima and elsewhere in the 20th century, but this past Friday was a day of personal tragedy for me and for a lot of simple, Faithful Catholics. 

I hope these thoughts help to provide some further context to the situation. The broad love for the Traditional Latin Mass isn't about style or taste or mere preference. It's not about Latin or Gregorian Chant. It's not about a reverent celebration of the Mass. It's not about the unquestionable truth that Jesus is present in the Holy Eucharist at any valid Mass. It's not about Papal authority or Papal infallibility. It isn't about unity within the Church or fringe groups. For the hundreds of thousands this will affect directly and for the tens of millions it will affect indirectly, it's simply about the fact the Old Mass and the communities attracted to it offer a clarity and consistency that many Catholic parishes struggle to provide. Honestly, I expect all of us can relate to that struggle in our own lives.

I hope you'll join me in prayer that Pope Francis reconsiders and has mercy upon so many good Catholics who love the Church and who love the Traditional Mass.

Bad catholic logic?,SouthernAT,1626703019,"So I was reading/listening to a few things from Joe Heschmeyer about his defense of the papacy when he said “an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”.

Then I was listening to a talk from Trent Horn and he used the same line “an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”. So now I’m questioning whether or not my reasoning for disliking this is off. Is this a good argument? Isn’t it a fallacy to just say “can’t prove a negative” and leave it?

I'm trying to understand why our teaching about being absolved by a priest of all mortal sin prior to Eucharist isn't something taught in  the Eastern Orthodox Church. Both churches carry apostolic teachings, so is being absolved before the Eucharist not something the apostles taught?  

Did they change their belief after the Schism, or did we change our belief sometime throughout the past 2,000 years?

I am aware of the scriptures talking about not partaking of the  Eucharist in an unworthy manner but the E.O. must have a historic and good reason for not requiring absolution before Eucharist.

Usage of the Biretta in the Ordinary Form,porchsittingfanatic,1626672125,"To all my brothers and sisters in Christ, greetings.

When does a Protestant convert need to get a conditional baptism?,yaa32,1626670561,"I've read that part of the process for confirmation after RCIA is conditional baptism, unless you're converting from a denomination that uses the Trinitarian formula ""I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,"" in which case your baptism is considered valid. United Methodists (my denomination) are included in that.

But I've also read that the formula ""*we* baptize you..."" is invalid. I've been wondering for a while if the pastors at my church have been using it - I seemed to remember hearing it but hadn't been listening for it. Today there was a baptism during the service and the head pastor and an associate pastor both dipped their right hands in the holy water, placed them on the baby's head, and said, ""*we* baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.""

Nobody else notices this slight change, but I'm sure now that they've been doing baptisms like this the whole time, since there's normally at least one assistant pastor present who also participates in the baptism. Are all these baptisms considered invalid, should any of the children eventually convert to Catholicism? And if so, shouldn't converts even from denominations that use the approved formula get a conditional baptism, for cases like this?",Catholicism

Sign of Peace,Leodeterra,1626666636,"**Question:** The Church says [Bishops' Conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_conference) determine what are appropriate [*Sign of Peace*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_of_peace) gestures. Do any of y'all do anything besides handshake/kiss/hug for the Sign of Peace?

**Me:** Pre-covid I would kiss my family, and a handshake or sometimes do a 15° bow for anyone else.

**Background:**

A friend asked me if New Zealand Catholics can do the [Hongi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongi) as a Sign of Peace. So I researched what gestures are appropriate and found:

This [2017 Aleteia article](https://aleteia.org/2017/08/17/the-sign-of-peace-the-ancient-roots-of-the-greeting-we-make-at-mass/) states:

&gt;after the Second Vatican Council the Church took a new look at the ancient custom (Sign of Peace) and decided to restore the original action of the faithful, entrusting each conference of bishops with task of determining **the cultural sign most appropriate.** 

[In 2014](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/30187/vatican-announces-desire-for-more-restrained-sign-of-peace-at-mass), the Congregation for Divine Worship said it would “offered four suggestions which are to form the 'nucleus' of catechesis on the sign of peace."" The second was:

&gt;2. Episcopal conferences should consider changing the way in which the exchange of peace is made, familiar and worldly gestures of greeting should be substituted with other, more appropriate gestures.

For the eager the other Congregation for Divine Worship suggestions were:

&gt;1. ""it is completely legitimate to affirm that it is **not necessary** to invite 'mechanistically' to exchange (the sign of) peace.”   
&gt;  
&gt;3. Several abuses of the rite are **to be stopped**:   
&gt;  
&gt;\-Introduction of a “song of peace,” which does not exist in the Roman rite  
&gt;  
&gt;\-The faithful moving from their place to exchange the sign  
&gt;  
&gt;\-The priest leaving the altar to exchange the sign with the faithful  
&gt;  
&gt;\-When, at occasions such as weddings or funerals, it becomes an occasion for congratulations or condolences.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. Episcopal conferences prepare liturgical catechesis on the significance of the rite of peace, and its correct observation.

How Do I Stop Being Nervous About Talking To Certain Saints?,pursuingholiness,1626664772,"There are saints I want to ask intercession from and have more of a relationship with, but I feel too nervous to ask for their prayer :(

Like St. Dominic and Blessed Alan De La Roche are *amazing*. I think they're so cool, and the thought that I can just talk to them and ask them to pray for me is like 🤯. I feel that I would probably faint if they acknowledged me in heaven. Same for St. Maximilian Kolbe and other saints.

Really, I only have a special devotion/relationship to some saints(St. Padre Pio, St. Gemma Galgani, St. Jude, St. Joseph, etc.) because they kept stalking me for so long, and sending me all kinds of timely advice from their writings. 
Basically, I'm a really shy person and have social phobia (even with prayer). When I first became a Christian and I realized I could talk to Jesus after admiring Him so much in the Bible, I got really excited and nervously rehearsed and wrote what I should say to Him. Which was frustrating because I felt that everything I wrote was lame, but then I realized that Jesus is God and knows everything, and that He could see and hear what I was doing; so I got really embarrassed and just talked to Him and told Him how awesome I thought He was.

It's not that way with the saints, though. I want to make a good first impression, but I don't think I'm interesting enough that St. Dominic or St. Francis would want to be my friend. I kind of prefer that a saint keeps popping up in my life and showing interest in me first, then I start to feel comfortable asking their intercession (which is how my patron, St. Jude and I became such good friends. He's such a faithful intercessor, and always there for me 💚).

Am I alone in this? :( 

I feel my question is kind of stupid and embarrassing. I just want to stop being shy. I say the rosary confraternity prayer almost everyday, and the end of it is ""St. Dominic, you who received so much grace and strength from the rosary, pray for us."" It makes me feel sad because I want to talk to him, but feel like I can't.",Catholicism

An easily digestible binderish thing on questions/ topics the average catholic is likely to be asked by a non Christian.

I personally could use something like this even though I already have many books on apologetics. It's not to be exhaustive on each topic as some topics are heavy but at least an answer to perhaps prompt each party to do more research. 

If you could let me know some questions you've been asked  about the faith and/or topics that have come up.. for topics that the average catholic should know in order to better defend the faith.  Your help is incredibly appreciated.

"What do you (a recent young convert) need to feel comfortable, welcomed, and encouraged in your process of faith? A question from a cradle-catholic.",Level_Shift_7516,1626650023,"(This is a very long post with a lot of context information that I deem relevant but maybe not vital. If you don't have a lot of time to read, jump to the questions at the end. Thanks!)

I happen to be the leader of the young adult group in my parish. I was born in a catholic family and never really stopped going to mass. Of course, I've had (and have) faith crisis, but I never considered leaving the Church. That is to say: I've decided to be a Catholic like everyone else, but I never went through a process of conversion from Non-Catholic to Catholic. My parish is constituted mainly by people like me.

During the last couple of years, we've increasingly seen a happy phenomenon: many converts join the parish and want to be part of our group. Everyone has benefited from it.  I can say that my faith has grown and become richer by the influence of the newcomers. I have been inspired by their stories of conversion, challenged by their questions, (re)inflamed in faith by their surrender. Some of them have become not only fellow Catholics but true friends. I will have the honor of being the godfather of one of them in his confirmation.

Our new members have some things in common. Almost all of them are young men who have struggled for one thing or another in life and that, at some graceful moment, found Catholicism. Some of them are re-encountering the faith of their parents, but most come from radical atheistic mindsets and are recovering from mundane (not to say sinful) ways of life. Also, most of them have been highly positively influenced by catholic resources online like this forum. I personally never entered here before one of them mention it. As a result, many of them are very well informed about basic theology, some apologetics, Church History, and liturgy. It's surprising, and it's always an invitation to humility when one of them explains with eloquence some theological nuance even before getting the sacraments. I bless the Holy Spirit for his work.

However, I sometimes feel that we fail to make them feel welcomed, answer their questions correctly, and be with them during their process. We've had a couple of deeply painful desertions. In addition, during the last couple of months, some tensions have arisen between the ""new"" and the ""old"" members of the group. As the leader, I feel responsible for this. I feel that I need to do my best to make them feel at home and to contribute to their process. So, on the one hand, I don't want to discourage them, but on the other, I do see some things that worry me. 

At times, the positive orthodoxy that they have received on the Internet turns into rigidity. Their love for the Church tends to be expressed with intolerance to other religions. And I fear that they spend too much time discussing exciting and maybe relevant topics, but overly dry for most Catholics. For example, I don't think that debating the legitimacy of specific battles over others during the First Crusade is more faith-enriching than the testimony of a contemporary saint. And, to be honest, I stop understanding when their zeal for what they understand of the magisterium leads them to flirt with anti-democratic and even white-supremacist ideas. 

I try to listen to them and take their radical phases as nothing else than parts of their exploration. I do my best to correct them with my limited knowledge and with the help of the Cathechism, but other ""old"" members of the group are less patient and prefer to leave. I've gone to the Parish priest, but in my part of the world, our vocations are low, and he is very busy attending the growing number of faithful (God bless for his effort and, seriously, pray for vocations). 

I have been following this subreddit now for a time, and I have noticed that here you guys (and girls) share a lot of good content. I thank God for that. I am always happy to read posts about people going to mass for the first time, overcoming fear of confession, or seeking strength in the battle against temptations. I pray for all of you and praise God for your conversions. I have also noticed that many of you have similar backgrounds to those of our new-parish members. So I feel confident enough to ask you the following questions: 

1. What do you expect when you arrive at a parish group as new church members?
2. What positive experiences or attitudes in others have encouraged you? What should ""old"" members of the parish keep doing or promoting?
3. What negative experiences or attitudes in others have discouraged you? What should so-called ""cradle-Catholics"" should understand about your process or avoid asking or do?
4. In the absence of a priest, and when the Cathechism is vague, which sources do you trust to answer your questions and doubts?

Any other comment (and prayer) is always welcomed!

I sometimes like to hear Sunday mass in different churches because I find that I like to meet different priests. There are some common factors in all masses said in my country. Before you go in, a man sprays disinfectant on your hands, takes your temperature with a non contact digital thermometer, and makes sure you are wearing a mask. Seats are also placed 2 metres apart. 

The priest disinfects his hands with alcohol before he consecrates the host and for communion, we stay in our places, the priest goes round, and puts the Body of Christ in our hands.

Today there was a baptism and the priest's words really moved me. He said that in my country 50% of all priests are over 75 years old. He admitted that priests like all humans make mistakes. He suggested that if we feel that a priest has made a mistake we go and find him quietly in the sacristy and tell him where we think he erred. He said that he welcomed any such feedback.

He continued that adults should be careful when talking about priests in front of children. ""With the declining number of Catholic priests, do you want to be responsible for choking the seed of vocation to the priesthood in the heart of a boy?"" he said.",Catholicism

Did I commit the sin of Usury?,AMECP,1626639489,"I have separate cases of what could possibly be usury. 

1. I bought my friend a 5 dollar game in return that he pays me back later when he can. He did pay me back but gave me 10 dollars and told me to keep it.  I said I didn’t want 10, I just wanted the 5, he said that he’s not gonna give me no money unless he gives me the 10, so I took his 10, maybe he was being charitable but I felt as if I committed usury in this case 

2. When the government shutdown was happening my dad was at risk of losing his job for long periods of time, so he asked me for money in return for me buying his car. Granted I didn’t low ball him and I bought the car that it was valued for, would this be usury?

I heard there is an argument that you can charge interest if the money being loaned would’ve been used for something else that would be making money but nothing outrageous.",Catholicism
Questions from a potential convert,consideringcatholic,1626639464,"I’m a Protestant with some questions about Catholicism as I am considering converting.

1. The dogma of papal infallibility wasn’t pronounced until Vatican I which began in 1868 and I guess the declaration of papal infallibility was released until 1870. However, the declaration that said the immaculate conception was dogma was released in 1854. The declaration of the dogma of the assumption of Mary wasn’t until 1950 so long after Vatican I. But how could the IC have been declared infallible if the right of the Pope to make infallible ex cathedral statements hadn’t been recognized until after the dogma of the IC had been proclaimed?


2. Here in the US there’s a lot of talk about denying Catholic politicians, most prominently Joe Biden and probably Speaker Nancy Pelosi,  communion for their views on the legality of abortion, even if they’re personally opposed to abortion. If that were to happen and Biden and Pelosi were denied communion at mass would that mean that they are in a state of excommunication or would they not technically be excommunicated and instead be in some sort of mixed or neutral zone where they can’t take communion but are not excommunicated?


3. Who has the right to declare a person excommunicated even if it’s not actually done a lot in modern times? Obviously the Pope can, but if you’re a random lay person who’s going around saying abortion is fine or talking about how they unrepentantly commit lots of adultery or something can the local Bishop, at least theoretically, excommunicate you? Could the local priest excommunicate you? I’m thinking of how in 1054 the Patriarch of Constantinople “excommunicated” the Pope, clearly he thought he had the right to even if he didn’t which indicates to me that excommunication clearly wasn’t something only the Pope could do, at least historically.


4. Do local priests have a right to unilaterally deny someone communion in the communion line during mass? Or is that something that is up to the local Bishop and the priest is required to just follow their local bishop’s directions? I’m thinking of a time during the 2020 presidential primaries when Biden was campaigning in South Carolina and I think a priest at a church he visited during mass denied him communion because of his position on the legality of abortion. But from what I read that was the policy of the local Bishop there that priests couldn’t give communion to politicians who supported legal abortion. If that wasn’t the direction of the local Bishop could the priest have denied Biden communion anyways just because Biden had widely known views on the legality of abortion or does an individual priest not have the right to make those kinds of decisions?


5. As a Protestant there’s a lot of things that I have grown up doing that aren’t all that important but that Catholics do differently. For example, I have always called Eucharist communion and I’ve always said the Lord’s Prayer a way that’s slightly different from the way Catholics say it (like saying debt and debtors instead of trespasses and those who trespass against us). If I went through with converting would I be required to change the way I do things like that? I imagine the communion name thing isn’t a big deal but could I continue saying the Lord’s Prayer the same way when I say it privately by myself? What about when at mass? I’ve gone to a few masses now and I always kind of follow along with everything but when we get to the Lord’s Prayer I will still say it the same way as always and finish a couple seconds earlier than everyone else and then be quite until the priest finishes the doxology (which really through me off the first couple masses I went to). Would I have to say it the same way in mass? I imagine that it’s essentially the same situation as a different dialect or language and I wonder if, say, a Spanish speaker who visited an English mass but didn’t speak English wouldn’t be allowed to say the Lord’s Prayer with everyone else but do so in Spanish. Or would I still have to change it because it’s kind of like the official translation of the Catholic Church for English?",Catholicism

Mass interrupted this morning,cinnamon_sugar,1626637923,"Something very strange happened this morning during mass.

Shortly after the procession into the church, a lady wearing sunglasses and a head covering slowly walked down the aisle and sat down in the very front pew. I immediately got a weird feeling as she walked by me.

During the early moments of mass she was holding her phone up to take pictures of the altar and choir areas.

While the deacon was giving the homily the lady was constantly shaking her head, as if she were disapproving...until at one point he mentioned Cain and Abel. That's when she nodded in approval and said something to the families sitting behind her.

Once the Eucharistic prayers started, she turned her back to the altar and faced the rest of the pews as we were all kneeling. Then once we stood up, she began walking down the aisle between the pews holding up an old book. At once, the ushers started walking to meet her. Once the ushers got close to her she walked backwards to her spot. After the ushers left, she started again down the aisle holding the book again - and again walked backwards to her spot once the ushers got close. This time the ushers sat down directly behind her.

At this point it was pretty clear she was trying to make a scene, and our priest seemed aware of what was happening. Once we began saying the Our Father, the lady ran up to stand in front of the altar and began shouting/reading from her book. Immediately our priest rushed towards her and forced the book closed. Several ushers then led her outside the church.

We restarted the Our Father and carried on with mass as normal.

Has anyone here ever experienced something similar? It was honestly a pretty creepy and frightening thing for us. The fact that she wouldn't face the Eucharist and was carrying an old looking book makes me think there was something satanic involved.",Catholicism

A sign from God?,solivagant-shadow,1626636672,"Now usually I am skeptical of “signs” because I know they are rare and I fear misinterpreting something arbitrary as a sign from God. However I have a story to tell about asking God for guidance as I discern which college to go to.

I was at a camp at a catholic college in adoration, praying to God to help guide me and to give me a sign if I should go to the college I was currently visiting. Later that day, the participants of the program had an activity which we were driven to in large vans, and on the way back is when I think God possibly delivered a sign.

I sat in the very back of the van next to a girl I haven’t yet spoken to. I started talking to her and asked if she was seriously considering the college. She was, and surprisingly her other top choice was also my other top choice. I told her how I was torn and that I have been praying in adoration for guidance. Interestingly, she told me something from a book she was reading called “trustful surrender to divine providence” or something. It was a quote from a saint and was along the lines of that if you’re in a state of grace and pray regularly, your decisions will align with God’s will. I don’t know if this is entirely accurate because I don’t remember exactly how she said this though.

I thought God could have been working through her to reassure me in a way I was on the right track. It didn’t outright say “go to this college” it was more like God guiding me and letting me know the heard me. Still not sure if this was a coincidence or not but during my conversation with her a instantly thought “what if this is a sign?”",Catholicism

""For most of us, for almost all of us, truth can be attained, if at all, only in silence. It is in silence that the human spirit touches the divine.""


""As we live our precarious lives on the brink of the void, constantly coming closer to a state of nonbeing, we are all too often aware of our fragitlity.""

""We need a moral philosophy which can speak significantly of Freud and Marx and out of which aesthetic and political views can be generated. We need a moral philosophy in which the concept of love, so rarely mentioned now, can once again be made central.""

""We need to return from the self-centred concept of sincerity to the other-centred concept of truth. We are not isolated free choosers, monarchs of all we survey, but benighted creatures sunk in a reality whose nature we are constantly and overwhelmingly tempted to deform by fantasy. Our current picture of freedom encourages a dream-like facility; whereas what we require is a renewed sense of the difficulty and complexity of the moral life and the opacity of persons. We need more concepts in terms of which to picture the substance of our being; it is through an enriching and deepening of concepts that moral progress takes place. Simone Weil said that morality was a matter of attention not of will. We need a new vocabulary of attention.""

"Coming back to God, balancing mental health and work",chronicallyearly,1626626435,"Hi friends!

I am 24 and on a journey of returning to God.

I grew up Catholic and went to an all girls Catholic high school. At my high school it was “cool” to be a non-believer and those who had faith were often mocked by the girls who did not believe. In my home life, a few family members were outspoken about being atheists. Needless to say, I became influenced and stopped engaging with my faith. 

In 2019 someone I know died from suicide. She was Mennonite and very outspoken about her faith. Her passion for Jesus inspired me and her passing reminded me that life is too short to not be faithful. 

I also recently met another Christian who has reminded me how much joy faith can bring. 

I have been dedicated to reading my Bible, and I’ve purchased Bible studies to help me gain a deeper understanding. Praying has helped to bring me a sense of peace (I am struggling with major depression). I start each day with a prayer and some gratitude. It really has helped. 

Currently I am struggling. I am a new nurse and I was blessed with my dream job (a .7 permanent on my favourite unit). I started in January. However, since the fall my mental health has deteriorated significantly. I have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a teen but it’s never been this bad. I have missed work due to my poor mental health, and I am on a medical leave of absence. I am clearly not managing my job well. It’s too much for me right now. I applied for a .5 term position which would be less demanding and I would be able to return to my permanent position in a year. Unfortunately I didn’t get the job. I am struggling with deciding whether I should continue to try to tough it out with my dream job and hope that I get better, or if I should do what’s best for me right now and seek out a less demanding position (which might mean that I lose my dream job). I am scared. 

I truly believe that God has never led me wrong, He brings the people I need the most and the opportunities I’m ready for at the right time. 

Please pray for me that I might find the right decision in regards to balancing my mental health and my job. 

Please pray for me on my journey to return to God. I don’t know what I need to do to continue moving closer to God, but I know that I need to continue moving closer to God. I am doing my best.

It seems morally problematic that God intends (and uses) evil as a component part (even if it is a privation) of the fabric of creation. How is this addressed in Patristics?,LegitCatholic,1626624428,"Aquinas [actually implicates God as author of evil](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article2), making the distinction between him as author by *penalty (poena)* rather than by *fault (culpa)*. For Aquinas, God uses the evil that humans make for the greater good of creation. But this seems to be problematic, as one might claim that God creates man as a kind of ""proxy"" to make evil so as to *use* evil for the final product that is creation. 

For visual thinkers: 

* 1. Imagine the created order as a tapestry. Each life, material and spiritual component adding up to the whole that we call creation. 
* 2. The threads that are woven into it are created things, and are good *as such*. 
* 3. We call evil [a privation](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm)  
* 4. Death, suffering, pain (the cross itself) are *essential parts* of creation. The final tapestry is filled with these *gaps* or *privations* (negative space) that we call evil. 
* 5. God not only *uses* evil, but has *intended* it from the start so as to complete his final tapestry. 

Please God, let there be some scholars or m.div's or whatever on this sub who have looked into this via patristics who may have a different perspective (I'm thinking Greek patristics esp. Gregory of Nyssa? Origen?)  Personally, I can't shake the thought that God's ""final tapestry"" ends up looking rather abhorrent if evil has been intended as the *secret sauce* to His masterwork of creation all along.

Do monarchs have any ecclesiastical or sacerdotal power in Catholicism?,TheoreticallyHitler,1626615282,"In many traditional societies, including ancient Judaism, but also Hinduism, Rome, Greece, and those in Meso-America, the king or emperor was a pontifex (bridge-builder) between Heaven and Earth. See, for example, King David's role, often performing the sacrifices in the Temple similar to the High Priest. Likewise, in ancient Rome, the Emperor was also the High Priest.

Obviously in Catholicism, the Pope is our pontifex maximus, and he one true one at that. But do properly anointed monarchs hold any power and authority in our Tradition? Are there examples of kings who were also priests or bishops?

I know that some (by no means all) amongst our Orthodox brethren hold the belief that the Emperor is the true ""head"" of the Church over the bishops. I understand this is not the Catholic view.

But I am interested in any readings or resources on this matter the subreddit can recommend. My interest is not so much in the political dimension, but in the spiritual role a king might play in the life of his people within the Catholic Tradition. Thanks in advance.",Catholicism
"I was a strong atheist all my life. I realized I'm not anymore. I am no believer either, but the feelings are so deep that have no accurate words for them. Please read me.",Altair1208,1626614414,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello Catholics,

I wrote multiple times in this sub already, as a catholic art, architecture, chants and history enthusiast, which I have been for years. And you have been so helpful to me. But all those times, what I was an atheist. An extremely strong one: one who thought religion was a mere tale - a stunning, remarkable tale nonetheless, full of art and wonders, born from people's egos full of their fear of death. See the universe, the darkness of it, its immensity - who cares what little ants like we are do, we ourselves can't communicate much with bacteria, right. But knowing it's all vain yet going for it anyways had a sense of tragedy that was profoundly beautiful to me. Sending messages across the universe for other inhabitants to find, building cathedrals, creating artificial hearts for people to not die, all of this, be it religion or science, felt kind of the same to me: the pure, man-made result of a natural fear of death, biggest horror of men's life, and a way to cope, to seek this eternity and perfection and longing for beauty we strive for, product of our evolved, extremely developed brains, capable of conceiving the ""self"" and refusing to let it go. I never believed in souls, just plain death, death as unnoticeable as an ant death, and I thought religion was a way, before science, to comfort people the same way science comforts them now, telling them we'll find cures, cryopreserve people, make them live forever.

I turns out I might have been wrong and I just now fully realized that, partly because of you all. I hung onto it for a long time, but ""atheist"" feels like something that doesn't describe me anymore. It sounds like a philosophy, just a philosophy, or a religion per se, and saying it's above other religions is so profoundly arrogant. Math and physics were never advanced or good enough to be able to say anything about god or his nonexistence anyways. Rationality has nothing to do with it all. I am so sorry. On behalf of all atheists, I am so deeply sorry.

You know, I don't even remember how it happened, but I somehow got hooked on martyrs stories, and I had a thing for St. Sebastian from the beginning on (about 2 years ago). I'd call it instant devotion, even if not getting why, even if being back then a full atheist. What I got from his exceptionally beautiful story and iconography was a sense of absolute I never had a grasp of before. You know, that overwhelming, otherworldly, unspeakable, terrible beauty that aches to the core like a bruised bone. He's portraying a sense of absolute that I can't find any accurate wording for. I mean, regarding St. Sebastian, there is a beauty in how he's often depicted that is unbearably perfect. He does make sense through death and death highlights the whole perfection of it all and he glows through it as other martyrs do, like if death, which was always an enemy to me, wasn't to him, he's above it, they are all above it. It's like you know, they have their halos in iconography, but those halos are there for real, when you see them you can feel the warmth. That unspeakable sense of beauty, those feelings, I've never experienced them out of the religious topic.

All alone, I've come to admit there is a possibility this otherworldly feeling comes from somewhere else, you know. Maybe our physical bodies, in fact, are not as advanced enough to pour such longing for eternity in our brain, what's good and what's ""the truth"" differs amongst people but they all seek it for all their lives, maybe I was wrong all along, maybe that extreme beauty that I've been feeling is too otherworldly for it to be just there like animal brains are. You know, I am from Europe and I even scheduled a trip just so that I could see Rome and St. Sebastian's relics in front of which I cried to because it was like a big reflection on our human world and the tragedies of our lives, and I even wear a medal of him that never leaves me, all of it is so strange for the ""rational"" me that I was, but I believe if everyone felt what I felt at some moments, they would get it also, souls and worlds outside our world are not that impossible, you can't put accurate words on it, I'm not saying it's there for real, I say you can put all the math of the world in it, It won't so far explain how I felt, never, and saying the opposite is profound arrogance. 

For the first time in my life, I have been getting it. From my very guts. I get what it's like to have a religious feeling. You might be disappointed as I'm far away from believing in a god that could listen to us, that would care about so little things like homosexuality, or whose son was there, sent out from the sky, and saved mankind. I'm not saying it's dumb, it absolutely is not and I think most of the story is beautiful, I love masses and Gregorian chants but again it's that feeling of beauty that draws me in, when it comes to the words put in it, the story, I'm not able to conceive that's what happened at all, but does that matter. This said, I was an atheist and now I get it all, the kneeling, the profound longing for depth and greatness -  I get it so much that I've had conversion in my mind for a few week, even thought I am not believing in the bible story. That's how far it goes, even if, of course, I'd never join without embracing it all, that's just how much the beauty is appealing to me, but I just wish I’d felt more and more of this perfection I've discovered in martyrs iconography and Gregorian chants and I don't know, it just makes sense.

Well since I am want to get closer to God and used to have doubts in the cathloic church, but ever since getting on this subreddit most of my doubts have been, listed and some things in history that not even history classes or highschool has taught me like in the french revolution there wasn't any mention about cathloic peasents being attacked or how the revolution was backed by masons or how the masons in mexico during the christerio revolution tried to outlaw the cathloic church and were willing to kill and wipe the mexicans to do so not once had I ever heard in public schools not even in college currently not even a zip or mention about it, which is why I am asking how is this book, because I am interested to know why the world is in the state that it is or the ideologies and the lies behind them, but before I read it and get it is this book good?",Catholicism

Also, I was glad that my priest had an awesome homily talking about the importance of confession and prayer and it was just so wonderful. I know there is kind of a somber mood here with Pope Francis and his recent directive, but It was just great to be back at a good mass and to see that my priest is solidly orthodox (even if he likes bad music) and as a plus, has decided that before every mass, he's open for confession, which is amazing and the way to go in my opinion since people might actually start attending.

Going through a crisis of faith,SpicyLizardWizard,1626544697,"Hey Catholics, It's your *local Lutheran*®

As I've been reading up on the historicity of the Bible for the past few days, I've been going through a crisis of faith that I cannot seem to resolve. I come to this subreddit because 1) Catholicism is Based, and 2) This seems to be one of the few Christian subs with genuine discourse/dialogue.

Reading the history of Jewish Monotheism/Monolatrism, I'm having to wrestle with the academic claim that ""El"" (where we get the Hebrew ""Elohim"" \[the primary lexical reference for ""God""\]) was originally a Canaanite creation deity, and that the Israelites merely assimilated and formed their culture around him. Furthermore, many of these academic sources claim that ""Yahweh"" (often translated as ""The LORD"") was initially a pagan warrior/storm deity, that he was ***initially distinct from*** ""El""/""Elohim"", but that the two gods merged into one later on in the Israelites' history.

Many sources also claim that the Israelites (originating from Canaanite populations) started off worshipping several gods, who mutated into the ""God of Israel"". Moreover, the claim that the Jews were initially Canaanite groups (and had no connection to Egypt or an Exodus) is very worrying for obvious reasons. The historicity and the dates proposed within the Bible also seem to be discounted as false or later additions, such as the United Monarchy of Israel and Judah, the magnitude of David's reign, etc.

If anyone could clarify these above points, I would be very grateful. Please note that this post is made in good faith *(alone)*, and that I desperately want to resolve these points. 

Note: Many of the above claims were mentioned in the wikipedia articles for [Yahweh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh#Late_Bronze_Age_origins_(1550%E2%80%931150_BCE)), [Elohim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim), and [El](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity)).

I recently watched a video that talked about how impure thoughts can be a mortal sin. 

I have known this for a while but hearing it presented clearly was a bit shocking to me and honestly extremely terrifying. 

From what I have read, for someone to have full consent they will know that they have chosen to think the thought despite it being mortally sinful. 

You would essentially have to say I know this is wrong and continue to think it without any resistance. As a result, you would know for sure that you committed a mortal sin. 

Is this correct? I have suffered from scruples in the past so, knowing that you can lose the sanctifying grace in your soul with a single thought is a disturbing concept and has been inducing a lot of anxiety.

Also, the thought that God could send you to hell for a single thought honestly doesn't sit right with me. I can't comprehend how someone who died on the cross would send us to hell for one mistake that we didn't even carry out in the physical world.

Text: ‘Traditionis Custodes’,Zestyclose_Dinner105,1626541243," Here is the Vatican’s official English translation of “‘Traditionis Custodes’ on the Use of the Roman Liturgy Prior to the Reform of 1970,” an apostolic letter issued by Pope Francis “motu proprio” July 16:

Guardians of the tradition, the bishops in communion with the bishop of Rome constitute the visible principle and foundation of the unity of their particular churches.1 Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, through the proclamation of the Gospel and by means of the celebration of the Eucharist, they govern the particular churches entrusted to them.2

In order to promote the concord and unity of the church, with paternal solicitude toward those who in any region adhere to liturgical forms antecedent to the reform willed by the Vatican Council II, my venerable predecessors, St. John Paul II and Benedict XVI, granted and regulated the faculty to use the Roman Missal edited by John XXIII in 1962.3 In this way they intended “to facilitate the ecclesial communion of those Catholics who feel attached to some earlier liturgical forms” and not to others.4

In line with the initiative of my venerable predecessor Benedict XVI to invite the bishops to assess the application of the motu proprio “Summorum Pontificum” three years after its publication, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith carried out a detailed consultation of the bishops in 2020. The results have been carefully considered in the light of experience that has matured during these years.

At this time, having considered the wishes expressed by the episcopate and3 having heard the opinion of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, I now desire, with this apostolic letter, to press on ever more in the constant search for ecclesial communion. Therefore, I have considered it appropriate to establish the following:

Art. 1. The liturgical books promulgated by St. Paul VI and St. John Paul II, in conformity with the decrees of Vatican Council II, are the unique expression of the “lex orandi” of the Roman Rite.

Art. 2. It belongs to the diocesan bishop, as moderator, promoter and guardian of the whole liturgical life of the particular church entrusted to him,5 to regulate the liturgical celebrations of his diocese.6 Therefore, it is his exclusive competence to authorize the use of the 1962 Roman Missal in his diocese, according to the guidelines of the Apostolic See.

Art. 3. The bishop of the diocese in which until now there exist one or more groups that celebrate according to the Missal antecedent to the reform of 1970:

§ 1. is to determine that these groups do not deny the validity and the legitimacy of the liturgical reform, dictated by Vatican Council II and the magisterium of the supreme pontiffs;

§ 2. is to designate one or more locations where the faithful adherents of these groups may gather for the eucharistic celebration (not however in the parochial churches and without the erection of new personal parishes);

§ 3. to establish at the designated locations the days on which eucharistic celebrations are permitted using the Roman Missal promulgated by Saint John XXIII in 1962.7 In these celebrations the readings are proclaimed in the vernacular language, using translations of the sacred Scripture approved for liturgical use by the respective episcopal conferences;

§ 4. to appoint a priest who, as delegate of the bishop, is entrusted with these celebrations and with the pastoral care of these groups of the faithful. This priest should be suited for this responsibility, skilled in the use of the “Missale Romanum” antecedent to the reform of 1970, possess a knowledge of the Latin language sufficient for a thorough comprehension of the rubrics and liturgical texts, and be animated by a lively pastoral charity and by a sense of ecclesial communion. This priest should have at heart not only the correct celebration of the liturgy, but also the pastoral and spiritual care of the faithful;

§ 5. to proceed suitably to verify that the parishes canonically erected for the benefit of these faithful are effective for their spiritual growth, and to determine whether or not to retain them;

§ 6. to take care not to authorize the establishment of new groups.

Art. 4. Priests ordained after the publication of the present motu proprio, who wish to celebrate using the “Missale Romanum” of 1962, should submit a formal request to the diocesan bishop who shall consult the Apostolic See before granting this authorization.

Art. 5. Priests who already celebrate according to the “Missale Romanum” of 1962 should request from the diocesan bishop the authorization to continue to enjoy this faculty.

Art. 6. Institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life erected by the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, fall under the competence of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies for Apostolic Life.

Art. 7. The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, for matters of their particular competence, exercise the authority of the Holy See with respect to the observance of these provisions.

Art. 8. Previous norms, instructions, permissions and customs that do not conform to the provisions of the present motu proprio are abrogated.

Everything that I have declared in this apostolic letter in the form of motu proprio, I order to be observed in all its parts, anything else to the contrary notwithstanding, even if worthy of particular mention, and I establish that it be promulgated by way of publication in “L’Osservatore Romano,” entering immediately in force and, subsequently, that it be published in the official Commentary of the Holy See, Acta Apostolicae Sedis.

Given at Rome, at St. John Lateran, on July 16, 2021, the liturgical memorial of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, in the ninth year of our pontificate.

Why no synodality allowed to inform how Bishops implement the new rules? This Motu Propio is more heavy handed than the slap on the wrist he gave the German Bishops for trying to change doctrines. So - folks who want to practice the faith seriously, who represent some of the most vital, growing, healthy parts of the Church are to be disenfranchised, but people who want to redefine human personhood, chuck sacred scripture in the garbage, and celebrate polyamory, sodomy, reproductive ""freedom"", and make God in their own image...they get a mild reprimand with no actual consequences.

This Sunday’s first reading is ridiculously appropriate after the Pope again outlawed the Mass of all times,JeanDeny314,1626533884,"Jeremiah, 23, 1-4: ""Woe to the shepherds
 who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!”declares the Lord. 2 Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: “Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done,” declares the Lord. 3 “I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number. 4 I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,"" declares the Lord.""

First reading of this Sunday’s mass in Paul VI Missal.

I have nothing against Paul VI mass, I almost exclusively attend it. Pope Francis’ decision is a disgusting tyrannical act taken in spite of the fact (who am I kidding *because of the fact*) that the TLM was extremely popular with the youth and would have naturally peacefully replaced Paul VI mass.

And this Sunday’s is an incredibly appropriate commentary on this situation.",Catholicism
Sin of adultery/masturbation is just too difficult to overcome that I’d rather give up,GamingCatholic,1626533748,"Hello all,

I struggle with masturbation quite a bit. Not a week goes by in which I do not do it.
Before I came back to the Faith I did it daily really, but now it’s reduced to maybe once every 1-2 weeks.
Adultery has followed the same trend.

However, the Catholic Faith requires none of this at all.
I just can’t fully give it up, as after a while it gives me a lot of anxiety and nature takes over.
I don’t feel ashamed of doing it, as I know that without the Faith I would do it more…

Yet, it makes me sad that I can’t follow all of the catholic requirements.
It’s that bad that I even just give up everything that has to do with the faith.
Why would I continue with it as I can’t be perfect?

I’ve never been to confession before in my life and that’s why I’m also skipping mass or skipping the eucharist.
I don’t want to have to confess the same thing over and over to a Priest as I know I will not improve…

God works in mysterious ways,Dependent-Summer2043,1626531667,"Long post, but worth the read.

I experienced a legit miracle, and I wanted to share my story. God has been putting me through purgation the past 6 months in an extraordinary way. I was heavily involved in the new age movement for 15 years or so, I was a cradle Catholic who always suffered from anxiety and depression, I've suffered from demonic dreams and experiences since I was a kid (nightmares of demons, doors would shake, etc). I always doubted myseld and had a low self esteem.

I suffered from alcoholism, and was slowly going crazy. I listened to ""spirit guides"" and did tarot. I was big into evps and caught the devil on evp disguised as a spirt helping me (along with other demons but I cannot explain the voice of the devil, you literally feel it in your soul). My life fell apart, I started a job that was terrible for me and my mental health, my car broke down multiple times and i was pouring all of my money into it, then I got a letter about the license i had just gotten back was suspended due to a warrant block (i was on probation for a dui, lied on the first drug and alcohol assessment and didnt change my address because i let my anxiety get to me, they had lost the assessment i lied on 3 years ago). I was going nuts.

I cried out to God saying ""please, I dont understand, please, i just want to be happy"". I prayed for the first time in years because I realized the demonic was everywhere, and i heard this voice in a clock saying ""i can hear you praying"", which was terrifying. Ensue diabolic obsession (it was present but they were fighting back and made themselves known).

I went back to church. I started praying deliverance prayers and also developed a regular prayer life, ive started going to confession regularly, and i attended mass at least 2 times a week most weeks. 6 months of hearing voices, the same that accused me my whole life. So many sleepless nights, and I was forced to confront the fears that held me back for my whole life. I always played the martyr, and realized ive been hiding behind pride my whole life (along with feelings of guilt, shame, low self esteem). I lived in my imagination, and i had to learn how to think logically and get out of my head more and take control back.

God did not release me from the obsession but gave me the grace to get through it instead. I got forced to take a real look at myself, learn how to be more humble, and correct my thinking (as well as the other experience making me start the therapy i avoided).

I feel like a new person. I have this sense of peace i havent felt before, even in the chaos. Im shifting out of unnecessary ""im sorry's"" and instead learning to be grateful. I learned some of my weaknesses and how to combat them. I learned when doubt sets in to rely on God and just how loving God really is. I realized more than I can even post in this.

In this whole experience, the old me (the one based on lies that entered my core belief system at a young age) is dying, and a new me is emerging in the brokenness. I think thats what the Bible means when the Bible says God hates the proud and will strike them down and when theyre humbled build them up and save them.

Pride is just hiding behind lies, a mask, we all do it, and were not living in the absolute truth (st thomas aquinas said if the means are bad and the end is good, the action is sinful... Which i started using and it made me realize ive been helping people coming from a place of fear, a place of self centeredness trying to justify the belief im a good person externally because i dont believe it myself, but i want to be. And to be good, you have to do things for the good of it, out of love, not out of fear).

God answers your prayers, He's listening and with you in the dark places, leading you out of the darkness into the light. We dont see it sometimes because we're all blinded by lies from pride. He is fully in the light, and we can only live in the shadow of the light in this life due to original sin. All of the bad things are out of genuine love for us.

Whatever you're going through, don't give up, turn to God, He knows what He's doing and He's right there with you, leading you out of the darkness (like when Jesus said he's the good shepard) and closer to the light. And the Catholic church truly is the church he founded because I've felt and seen it and the teachings helped me through this dark time. Ive witnessed the power of confession as well as communion first hand and the power of the Rosary.

I hope to use my story in its entirety (which is too long to post here) to help lead people back to Jesus from the New Age movements and false movements because I've been in the same darkness.

Pope Infallibility,forevergeeks,1626530988,"Hi everyone, 

Pope Infallibility is one the things I have always have issues with, and now with the news of Pope Francis eliminating the tridentine rite mass, and seeing the reaction from many faithful in this forum, I want to put this topic for discussion and try to understand the assumption of the pope is infallible a little bit more 

What does Infallibility means? And if the Pope is indeed fallible, can we assume that some of the dogmas of the church are wrong because they have been created or reinforced by decree of the Pope? 

I do see the need to have a central authority in the church, so I'm not questioning the need to have a Pope, but I see the Pope as a referee who settles things when they are out of control and restores order when things get too chaotic, but infallible implies more than that too me, Infallibility is an attribute that is fitting only to a divine being.",Catholicism

I am very disheartened and irritated and I feel that I am a complete coward and loser because articles and forum threads say that each one has to be outward of his/her Catholic faith.,rock_bite002,1626525708,"I am not looking for advice here. Do not give me any bible verses, catechism lines, anecdotal stories, nor encouragement because they do not help for me. I do not have anyone else to talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

In general, I am asocial. I prefer to be alone most of the time. I hate socializing and interacting with others. I prefer my own company rather than surround with other people. I am a very private person. I rarely feel lonely, but when I did, those feelings don't last long. I do not care about spending time with other people and I do not have any plans in changing that. Having to deal with other people stresses me out. It's not worth it for me. I am not interested in it.

This applies to me whether I'm religious or not. My religious background has no influence on my personality and psychology.

Anyway, I like being alone. But this Catholicism only discourages me because of this command to be outward of my faith and evangelize others.

I ran onto a recent thread here (unfortunately I can't find it anymore, maybe deleted?) that talked about if it is a sin to not be outward of his Catholic faith. He was asked by his coworker about him and his girlfriend not living together and just responded that that is what they want instead of that is what the Catholic Church teaches. And the responses there were saying that he should be outward and converse about it.

In that same thread, one commenter linked to a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzJzmsajuaI) of Fr. Mike Schmitz on shyness being an excuse. I did not watch it and do not want to because I feel very irritated to watch it for now. I'm not going to make further comments about it because, again, I did not watch it.

There is this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/2jugmv/is_it_a_sin_to_hide_your_catholic_faith/) here if it is a sin to hide one's faith. And the top comment there is a bible verse referencing denying Christ.

There was a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgQqVRQ80mA) (at 4:31 timestamp) of the TFP Student Action in YouTube. In that part, I personally don't blame them, but watching that part makes me feel cringe not because of them, but because it reminds me of those Catholic articles and forum threads saying that we need to be outward of our faith.

There is this [one](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/no-the-truth-is-not-like-a-lion) article written by Trent Horn in Catholic Answers. There is that line at the beginning that as an apologist, the line  “Preach the gospel, use words if necessary” is irritating for him.

There are other articles talking about why Catholics do not evangelize and saying that such excuses are not good.

&amp;#x200B;

All this makes me feel like a complete failure to my part. I feel like God will not welcome me because I denied Him for not being outward of my faith. I really do not like dealing with people. I am a private person. I prefer my own company. I am not ashamed of my faith, but I do not want to talk about it with others. I just want to live my faith life on my own without dealing with other people. But reading all these bible verses and articles telling Catholics to be outward and evangelize and not be afraid of the consequences only irritate me more.

I have had bad experiences of talking about my faith and theology. I do not know anything apologetics, but I feel forced to learn about it simply because I read that it is bad to not defend the faith.

They say that the world hates Christians and we should be joyful of ourselves. So what? You want me to risk my own life just for that? I'm going to lose my sanity because I'll become a target for a lot of people. I can't defend and answer questions. But I feel irritated and depressed because I have to be outward, defend, and answer questions no matter how much I do not want to. It stresses me that it is not worth it for me.

I keep comparing myself to popular martyrs like Jesus's apostles. I feel like a loser because they risked death while I do not. I keep having mixed complicated feelings of calm of not showing my faith and being a coward for not showing it.

I'm writing this post because I'm angry at this idea that elders seem to have in my direct community that Catholicism is strictly the sad/bitter person's religion.

I understand that there's moments when you can't smile or laugh too hard, like during Lent and Consecration and Confession, etc. Etc. Everything has its time and place.

What point does admiring beauty turn into lusting,Greedy-Ad-2944,1626504423,"
I’m Farley new to the Catholic faith again and am still trying to understand what looking with lust is. I’ve read the Catholic answers articles and read that it’s when you look at a women and imagine you having sex with them, but then other people say it’s when you look at a girl and you fee sexual desire the first look and if you look again it’s lusting even if you don’t imagine anything in your mind.

For example, would looking at a girls body be sinful I.e checking a girl out, and how many glances would u have to take for it to count as lusting(mortal sin), And let’s say you like the persons personality and they’re body as a whole so you like to look at their body for a extended period of time (admiring beauty), but you feel a sexual desire but try to ignore it, would that be sinful?

My church plays contemporary Christian music made by idiotic evangelical protestant bands. I absolutely hate it. I feel like those songs have no reverence and make the mass feel like some type of revival party. It is absolutely disgusting to me and I wish hymns and chants were played. This other reason is also related to the music: I feel like the Ordinary Form is just basically a way for other musicians to play. For example, our priest let some band play the music and as a result we had an electric guitar, tambourines, and a few other instruments playing again, that horrible contemporary music. The environment and ambience of the Ordinary Form also feels like it has a lack of reverence. I can't find what I see in the Extraordinary Form in the Ordinary Form.

And second, I can't control this honestly, but the churches where the Ordinary Form in my area are hosted are so dull. No decorations, just a crucifix on the altar and a small table and we're done. When I see those Extraordinary Form churches, they have such beautiful designs and decorations with altars and it is treated with so much respect.

Penal vs penal-moral laws,Onedirection32,1626500380,"So in general, Catholics are called to obey just laws, but there’s a concept in moral theology where some laws issued by the state  are merely “penal” (ie. one can go against the laws, but must be willing to pay the fine or jail time if they’re caught). I believe the idea is that one is still being obedient to the law in this case as they are willing to pay the fine if caught, which the law says they are obliged to do. This is opposed to “penal-moral laws” which are laws issued by the state that are also based on Natural Law/morality, which would make it a sin to break such laws even if one is not caught.

How valid is the existence of purely penal laws? And how can one evaluate which  laws are penal vs which laws are penal-moral? 

Take, for example, speeding a few miles/kilometres (under 5) over the speed limit, drinking underage (not to excess), et cetera. There might even be a good reason to go against the law - for example, it could be dangerous to drive at or below the speed limit in a situation where the cars around you are speeding, or it could put you in the danger of road rage.

I am asking this question cause I am into the whole abortion debate I am pro choice extremely but one thing pro life and people who are against abortion would say is that it's wrong to kill an innocent person. that got me thinking who exactly would be innocent and I came down to three type of people. the one I wanna talk about is the third one, those who don't commit sin. so that is what I wanna ask you 
   1. side note if you saw abortion and saw that I was pro choice and is already trigger by that and is gonna respond to me with hate and not even gonna be open minded about this plz just leave 

so with all of that out of the way i'll tell you what I been thinking 

so I been thinking about who would be consider innocent and one of the type of people that would follow under this are those who commit no sin, but that got me thinking if a criminal was to die they would most likely go to hell that would be  understandable but what about the people who are or would be sinner under the eyes of the lord but technically done nothing wrong, would they be doomed to hell?

here is where Ill give some example and I wanna note 2 thing 

1. for the sake of this argument or example I would be lumping all crime together. so what I mean is that most people would say that a theft should not deserve the same punishment as a murder  but to keep it all simple I would be lumping all crime together so murder, stealing,  pollution it's all the same for this argument
2. I would be using myself and you the person reading this in the examples I give.

ok so to start off the example i'll tell you which of the 7 sin probably best represent me. the sin are wrath, envy, greed, sloth, lust, gluttony and pride. out of these 7 sin I say lust probably represent me the most so that is what i'll be using.

would I be consider less innocent or less good as a person if I was to live a lustful lifestyle not hurting anyone then compare to a murder that repent for his action ?

1. so If I was live a life where I am sleeping with 10 different women ever month so around 120 different women a year until I either die or I just get physically incompatible of living that life style would I be seen as less redeemable then 
2. you a person who murder somewhere between 2-10 people and try to redeemed and atone for their sin ?

would you have a better chance of getting into heaven or at least be seen as a better person in gods eyes if you repent for your murder even though me a lustful person never hurt people just slept around a lot but refuse to repent? even if I actively try to be good to people and help other would my lustful life style negate all the good and i'll still be damned to hell just because I refuse to apologize or give up my way of living? I this senerio at worst I just never hurt anyone at best I actively try to help people but because I wanna sleep around with different women and not reform to a different life style dose that mean someone who actively went out of their way and hurt people is more worthy of heaven or is a better person because they at least tried to repent?

&amp;#x200B;

if that is the case those that mean I would have a better chance of getting into heaven if I was to actively become a serial killer, spend my 20s and 30s killing people and once I hit 40 I stop killing and devote the rest of my life to god repenting for my action until the day I died ? 

&amp;#x200B;

this is what is I am pondering and if that is the case then that mean in the eyes of the lord a sinner who committed no crime but refuse to repent is just as guilty as a criminal which mean they both would be dammed to hell and if that is the case then I can only imagine at most 10% of the population would be truly innocent.

&amp;#x200B;

if you made it this far I wanna thank you I know this was a lot but it's really been on my mind I imagine i am probably way off and a lot of you are probably laughing right now cause you thought it was funny but like I mention I am not a religious person and I haven't read the bible so I would be ignorant of so I look forward to reading your answer",Catholicism

Did I receive Holy Communion properly?,b22299,1626489379,"So I went to confession, and after I asked for Holy Communion. The Priest came out and gave it to me and I took it and then we talked about my penance and I left. It wasn’t a big penance, and I had absolution first. It wasn’t during mass. Not sure what happened. Was this appropriate? Also I’m worried I acted like a fool and almost blasphemed the name of God in my head a couple days ago because I was upset, at first I was angry but then the thoughts quickly got to the point of really blasphemous so I slammed the car breaks and everything flew off the seat.

***Second Appeal to the Vatican***  


***One of the axioms of contemporary publicity, religious as well as secular, is that modern man in general, and intellectuals in particular, have become intolerant of all forms of tradition and are anxious to suppress them and put something else in their place.***  


***But, like many other affirmations of our publicity machines, this axiom is false. Today, as in times gone by, educated people are in the vanguard where recognition of the value of tradition is concerned, and are the first to raise the alarm when it is threatened.***  


***If some senseless decree were to order the total or partial destruction of basilicas or cathedrals, then obviously it would be the educated – whatever their personal beliefs – who would rise up in horror to oppose such a possibility.***  


***Now the fact is that basilicas and cathedrals were built so as to celebrate a rite which, until a few months ago, constituted a living tradition. We are referring to the Roman Catholic Mass. Yet according to the latest information available in Rome, there is a plan to obliterate that Mass by the end of the current year.***  


***We are not at the moment considering the religious or spiritual experience of millions of individuals. The rite in question, in its magnificent Latin text, has also inspired a host of priceless achievements in the arts – not only mystical works but works by poets, philosophers, musicians, architects, painters, and sculptors in all countries and epochs. Thus it belongs to universal culture as well as to churchmen and formal Christians.***  


***In the materialistic and technocratic civilization that is increasingly threatening the life of mind and spirit in its original creative expression – the word – it seems particularly inhuman to deprive man of word-forms in one of their most grandiose manifestations.***  


***The signatories of this appeal, which is entirely ecumenical and non-political, have been drawn from every branch of modern culture in Europe and elsewhere. They wish to call to the attention of the Holy See the appalling responsibility it would incur in the history of the human spirit were it to refuse to allow the traditional Mass to survive, even though this survival took place side by side with other liturgical forms.***

Help Me Convert My Dad,iEatCuteDumplings,1626483627,"My dad is Catholic, but he’s a convert from some small southern church, he converted to get married, and has done almost nothing and changed very little beliefs for his Catholic faith since then. I have a list of some things about him below that leave me not knowing where to start to convert him and make him actually try and put effort into changing his life to love God, but he won’t because he thinks he’s fine. I know God wants me to convert and help him but I don’t know how because he never listens to anything I tell him that’s against his beliefs. Please just give me some advice on how to make him decide to truly and wholly believe, follow, and follow the Catholic faith and make him try to stop his sins which he doesn’t believe are bad.

He:

Loves God to small extent

Believes in his own way instead of any religion, getting inspiration from TikTok even sometimes, and it seems he’ too prideful to believe on the authority of the Church alone maybe.

Decides on his own what is sin and what is not, judging most people as sinners and himself as not sinning hardly at all

Is a Convert

Believes the purpose of going to mass is to receive communion even though he should not receive at all since he hasn’t been to confession in 20 years

Watches pornography (secretly but he doesn’t know it’s in his history), but tells me a lot of sexually impure things are fine because “it’s just a body”

Uses the Lord’s name in vain, but claims it’s not in vain to say Lord Have Mercy, Lord, and Oh My God all the time in anger whenever something bad happens (but condemns others for saying God D***)

Curses all the time but is strongly against the use of the f word, d word, and a few others.

Extremely prideful and judges everyone

Thinks that no one with more life to live (said this after watching a movie with me about the life and death of Thomas More, which he doesn’t believe), would give their life for God and said that he (my dad) would not do so himself

Doesn’t really believe in the Catholic doctrine but says frequently that priests interpret and preach on their own (as this is slightly true in some cases).

Doesn’t go to confession

Doesn’t really want me to be a priest (I’m a 15 year old boy)

Loves me very much to the point of overprotection (not allowed in street, etc)

Little empathy

Judges everyone

Stubborn, proud, thinks he is always right

Told me he was a Protestant Catholic hybrid when he was younger but that he wanted me to be fully Catholic.

Cares most about being successful in life

Only does what he sees as required by God like mass on Sunday (which he thinks is because he has to receive communion)

Lies in business

Never prays on his own except maybe when very bad things are happening like his sister nearly dying.

Some effort to come closer to God but extremely little and based on many false beliefs.

Molds his beliefs to what makes his actions not sinful and his spiritual life easy.





It is very difficult to help him because he doesn’t listen to most of what people say and has very great pride.
I know I complained a lot about him here; I tried not to but gave up, but everything written here is truly honest and true. He’s not a “bad” person, it’s just that these things are bad for his soul. I thank you in advance for any help you can give as this is more important than anything I’ve done in my life besides coming closer to God myself as this could make the difference in my father going to heaven or hell.

Thank you so much for helping me and I pray that this will work out.",Catholicism

The persecution of the Orthodox Church and Christians in the Soviet Union is a history that everyone should study because of lessons it involves.,Anglicanpolitics123,1626477062,"What happened to the Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union due to the Soviets anti religious campaigns is a historical lesson that everyone can learn from in the same way we learn from other atrocities like the African Slave trade, Holocaust or the Armenian genocide. What you see in this particular form of oppression is this.

**(i)It was genocide at many levels. Including the 30s.**

* It is estimated during the period of Joseph Stalin that up to 100,000 priests were executed, especially during the Second 5 year plan and up to 20 million Orthodox Christians were put to death. So this was definitely a genocidal campaign.
* Before in the Russian civil war you also had mass execution of priests and religious believers as well, though not to the same level but with very gruesome details. In 1918 for instance there was a case where priest who tried to stop the execution of a peasant was beaten and cut to pieces by a sword. A priest who was sentence to death in another instance was about to make the sign of the cross. So they chopped off his hand and then sentenced him to death by firing squad. In another instance in the diocese of Perm you had a priest who was arrested and the Cheka(Soviet secret police) cut out his cheeks and eye balls and then paraded him through the streets before burying him alive. In other instances they would drown priests and nuns in holes of ice in lakes during the winter or force them to take communion with melted lead so they would suffocate while taking the sacrament.

**(ii)It started in stages. All involving ""rational"" explanations for the public**

* First the Soviets said that they simply wanted to separate Church and State. Afterwards the Soviets said that they wanted to simply end what they say as the Church's ""privileges.
* The Soviets then when they were faced with a famine in the 20s during the Russian Civil War. What they said was that the Church was doing nothing for famine relief and that instead it was hoarding all this property and gold. That was of course false. The Orthodox Metropolitan of Petrograd Benjamin had a reputation of helping the poor and orphans. He reached an agreement when it came to the sale of property and certain supplies for famine relief with the Petrograd authorities but the Soviet authorities rejected the deal. They sought to seize all of the Church's property. When the priests resisted Lenin signed a decree that had 14,000 of them executed. Benjamin of Petrograd who ironically enough had a reputation for helping the poor. He put on a show trial and then executed by firing squad.

**(iii)It involved a systematic culture war**

* The Soviet Union's culture war against the Church took on many forms. One was the destruction and shutting down of Churches. The most famous being the Cathedral in Moscow in the 30s. Under Khruschev the Soviets initiated a new campaign to end Churches in 1959 with the number of Churches being reduced from 22,000 to 7,000.
* Accompanying this was a systematic campaign of demonisation in the public and education system. The communist party had what was called the ""League of militant Godless"" who's aim was to thoroughly demonise the Church in the public square through a propaganda campaign aimed to turn the populace against priests so they could be arrested and sent to the Gulags. Scholars have compared the demonisation program under Stalin in the 30s to Hitler's demonisation program against the Jews. They tried other methods such as in the 1970s under Brezhnev when the textbooks in schools and universities explicitly mentioned the need to promote ""scientific materialism"" and ""scientific atheism"" and the fact that the Church has to be condemned because it was the ""opiate of the masses"" that was an enemy of the progress they were making in society. One tactic was to accuse priests of either being spies working for the West, the Germans or the Japanese. Another was to accuse the priests of sexual indiscretions and use that as an excuse to send them to the Siberian Gulags.

**(iv)The Soviet authorities infiltrated the Church through Renovationists who sought to ""modernise"" the Church**

* There were a group of priests that were called the ""Red priests"". Another name is the ""Renovationists"". The Soviet authorities forced the Orthodox Church to put them into positions of authority. Some of them being secret Soviet agents themselves. What the ""red priests"" argued was that the Church was being ""reactionary"" with its traditional perspective on worship and social life which was at odds with the Communist movement. They said it must adapt to the times by adopting the communist ideology, modernise, and adopt the materialistic perspective on things.
* In reality the Soviets were using the renovationists as an attempt to launch an internal coup inside the Orthodox Church so they could take it over, with this happening when the Patriarch Tikhon was desposed and then placed under house arrest. Many also said that those who chose to adhere to the traditional Orthodox Christian beliefs were engaged in heresy because they refused to adopt the Soviet modernised doctrines. Eventually ironically enough some of the renovationists themselves were arrested and sent to the Gulag because the Soviets were just using them as a means to an end.
* During the second phase, especially in the 60s and 70s the Soviet Union again had effectively infiltrated the Orthodox Church through the KGB which tried to get the Church to abandon its traditional ""resistance"" to socialism and see socialism as the way to go.

**(v)The Soviets justified what they were doing in the name of ""justice"" and ""progress"".**

* They said that the Church was a reactionary institution that was involved in historic injustices in the past during Tsarist times. Because of this they were justified in doing whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted to ""correct"" those injustices. The destruction of Churches was justified because Churches historically had places of privilege in society. Seizing Church property was justified because it was to ""help the poor"".
* The irony of this is that, especially in the 30s, the people who most resisted these moves happened to be people who were apart of the classes considered to be historically oppressed. Peasants and women. They were the most likely to be opposed to these moves and resisted them especially during Stalin's First Five Year Plan. They denounced the Soviet authorities as being no different from the Anti Christ from their perspective. This was of course missed because many of the Communist authorities were typically a part of the Intelligensia. So even though they talked about the poor, some were out of touch with how the poor or peasants actually felt. Including their religious sensibilities. Others like Nikolai Bukharin were more in tool which is why he advised against a campaign of physical destruction of Churches",Catholicism

My fellow Calvinists, might as well have thought I did a cannonball into the lake of fire. It wasn't easy, and I felt alone for a long time. 
I faltered many times, first not seeking the Catholic Church, but seeking Eastern Orthodoxy, eventually realizing that they had their own set of beliefs that didn't seem to line up with history at all, and eventually found my way into the one true Church. 

 The one thing that kept my heart true other than the Holy Spirit of course, is the fact that I had the Catholic church's historicity to look to every time my heart faltered, I would have just stayed a Calvinist, because without the historicity of ALL of the Church's claims, there is no reason to be Catholic, because then those claims mean nothing if not provable, in other words, authenticity throughout history is what makes Catholicism have the ability to prove itself. You have the church fathers that supported doctrines that the church defined later, you had people writing about traditions that were there since the beginning, it's historicity is ironclad, we have a history that goes back to Jesus himself, that has laid the foundation of every single person that believes in Jesus today, whether Protestants like to believe this or not, it's true, It all came from the original one true church that Jesus himself founded the day he told Peter that he would build his church upon this rock, and gave him the keys, and gave him the authority to bind a loose. 

As a younger person in this world, I'm a millennial if you want to label me, authenticity is a cornerstone of what I choose to consume, believe in, and how I dictate whether something is false or not. Authenticity matters because in this modern world people my age, and I'm on the far end of it, I was born in '84, We are constantly trying to be sold something, told something, convinced, or pushed into a direction. So folks my age and younger are constantly watchful for people trying to scam us or lead us into a false sense of what is right and wrong.

Let me be absolutely clear, I am in no way saying that the new mass is trying to scam anybody, or lead me into a false sense of what is right and wrong, that is not what I'm saying, and that is not what I'm implying here. The church I go to has the new mass, and I have zero issue with attending it. 

All that being said, my actual thought on the subject was rather simple but I felt that I had to explain myself.
The reason that his decision is disappointing, it's because there are  ton of new converts into Catholicism that go to churches that have the traditional mass for a reason, and that reason is that that mass, feels more authentic to the message of being a sojourner here on the Earth, being that person that is set apart because they live for God, And when you go to a traditional mass it has a feeling of being old and has a certain antiquity to it, but something that's been done since Jesus was alive and that feeling of the atmosphere is really important to people my age. The modern Mass has a modern ring to it, which people in my generation tend to not favor. The church changed a lot to fit into a modern world, whether or not the actual doctrine changed or not, the language changed And it appears as something modern, and changed. 

That's my two cents about it, I'm not making any claims that my opinion matters, or that I I am right or not, just how a younger person feels. 
Here's a really good article that really expresses kind of the same thing maybe it'll be a easier read for you but I felt that it closely aligned with the way I thought. 
God bless you all and peace be with you.

"My experiences at the local ""TLM""",StrivingEvermore,1626465005,"The EF Mass was not allowed in my diocese until SP came along (the former bishop was problematic to say the least.) When it did, our fairly new bishop strategically arranged for the celebration of the EF Mass throughout the diocese. Without question, in my deanery, he chose the right, highly orthodox parish which had long been run by Franciscans.

There was great anticipation in the ""tooling-up"" for the EF, including the bishop allowing the tabernacle to be re-positioned back into the rear center of the sanctuary. The pastor also requested and received the gorgeous prayer cards and *Missale Romano* from his novitiate which he had attended some 40 years before.

In retrospect my bishop made one terrible error. Rather than have the pastor and the parochial vicar celebrate the EF (they were willing and able!), he assigned a retired prison chaplain with no ties to the parish. I suspect this was in effort to not overload the pastor and the parochial vicar who were already celebrating 2 Masses every Sunday.

The mood before the first Mass was AMAZING! The pastor of the parish was interviewed by the local news. People were joyous and interested!

The first Sunday was an experience to be remembered. First was the crowd. There were at least 500 in attendance (inside a church that holds 600.) A small but very visible minority seemed to be of a different breed. Severe-acting with scowls on their faces, sucking-up all the open ministries such as usher. Just where the hell did these people come from?

The pastor and his celebration of the (Low) Mass was unimpressive. One of his few announcements after the Mass was to tell all females to make sure their wore hats the following Sunday. Hmmm...

I attended the coffee social after the Mass. Discussions were dominated by the desire to create ""their own chapel."" (That, and their disdain for the ""novus ordo church."") This absolutely boggled my mind after a nice, supportive parish, had already given them a good Mass time and great support. This desire for division was heartbreaking.

I attended again about a month later. It was the middle of the summer. I was wearing a muted aloha shirt and nice/dressy Bermuda shorts. The usher tried to stop me from entering the Church. I ignored him. The congregation was down to maybe 150.

I went to one final Mass at the end of the summer. Perhaps 50 in attendance. Still a Low Mass -- they lacked the resources (e.g. organist) to celebrate a higher form. I later asked the pastor about this. He said he was willing to give them *carte blanche --* whatever they needed, but the priest had refused all offers of help. Instead their focus was on moving to a chapel at the local Catholic cemetery.

The self-described ""traditionalists"" had been given a prime chance here locally and they blew it! How I wish the pastor and PV has been placed in charged of celebrating the EF Mass here locally! How I wish they would have been able to bring the resources they had to bear (organist, singers, superb altar boys, etc.) How I wish they would have been able to mitigate the effects of the severe, sour-faced ""traditionalists.""

FWIW, I know so much, because I was monitoring the Mass for a local Eastern Catholic pastor who was concerned about the possible impact to his parish. He needn't have worried. Today the celebration of the EF Mass is on life support here locally.",Catholicism

But maybe God’s greater plan is for her not to get the vaccine and to die. Maybe God wants her to die.

Below is an answer to a question posted on the above website. I have ample experience within the traditional subset of the Catholic faith. I have many whom I minister to that proclaim there was rampant abuse, toxicity, and highly covered up scandals. These reports have prompted extensive questions into the issues within this group. Personally, I've been investigating the ""rad trads"" for years. I've been part of archdiocesan complaints and joined groups which encouraged serious inquiry into this issues within the traditional movement. 

I want to assure everyone, I love the TLM and I fully stand behind the teachings of the faith. However, many on reddit are unaware of the underlying issues (arguably of higher magnitude than the sexual abuse scandal). The toxicity has ripped apart families. It involves lay people and priests covering up blatant scandals. Further, I've known this was coming for quite some time. however hard it may be to believe for some, I can state will 100% confidence -- this is the biggest blessing the Catholic Church has EVER received. 

Please don't ask, I will not name any names or point any fingers. Those responsible will be held accountable and some will be made an example of. 

This is the time for unity!

**Do traditionalists defy papal authority?**

*from ""Traditionalists, Infallibility and the Pope"" by Rev. Anthony Cekada* 

Catholics new to the traditional movement sometimes fear they are defying papal authority. Are they? 

No. Unlike many traditionalist groups, we do not believe one can simultaneously hold that (a) The changes in the Church were bad and (b) The popes who promulgated the changes continued to possess authority from Christ. 

Both propositions cannot be true. The authority of the Church *cannot* give evil or error. 

But once you acknowledge the obvious - that the Vatican II changes *were* in fact harmful to souls - only one reasonable explanation remains: the men who promulgated these change, from Paul VI on down, either **lost** or **lacked** true authority to do so.",Catholicism

Real Cristero banner and what it means for us,RPBolfork,1626459019,"This banner was carried by cristero soldiers in the war throughout the region of Los Altos de Jalisco, it is unknown how many combats it saw. It has been kept by my family because it wasn't pretty enough to be in churches and the entire cristero revolution and it's advances and accomplishments were thrown away by a bishop in Mx City who had never been with the fighters and didn't knew what it was like, a great-great uncle of mine picked it up (illegally) from a pile of bodies and garbage that was to be burnt, the dark stains are made with blood of the martyrs who died defending it after the bishop of Mx City betrayed the army and turned in the commanders because the bishop of Guadalajara (the bishop of those who had taken up arms) refused to surrender and was even exiled in the US sneding support from there, some commanders and warlords were even executed by other cristero commanders who were ordered to capture their peers and send them to firing squad. Men died so this image wouldn't be defiled.

On this grim ""Traditionis custodes"" day, this is what Cristero armies stood for, the  One True Catholic Church, the one ourfore fathers and our people fought and were martyred for, the Truth, that is not pleasant for everyone and that does not belong to lobbies, it just Is, like an immovable stone wether people like it or not. They were betrayed by bishops who turned to dust all of the sacrifices of the martyrs and who didn't even know what the fight was for and how crude it had been, and still they did not leave the Church, because they knew she still was the one, it was just some people in charge who were scandalised by  Christians who took their faith to the last consequences, something worth killing and dying for.

Yet, I say this as someone who attends NO masses with tonnes of liturgical abuses and Liberation theology up to the neck in the homilies, no Tridentine Mass has been celebrated in the diocese of the Cristeros since CVII and bishop while he's a good person, don't really pay attention to us who want a single TLM mass a week. We, as the heirs of cristeros, have a responsibility to stay within the Church and continue to militate within Her, to the last consequences, because the Church will remain but these bishops and their petty attempts will not. This is just a minor setback compared to what Cristeros and the Church in México went through. Hold your positions, remember the men who died defending this banner yet after all was lost.

I myself have not regularly attended mass and have committed some sins that weigh heavily on my heart. I also feel cut off from God. I have been very anxious lately and really want to make some changes.

Should I call and ask to meet with a priest about all of this? Is that the right way to go about it.

Slowly losing my faith (and crying my eyes out),angpuppy,1626457886,"It's been very slow coming. I've felt like my faith has been being attacked for eleven years. 

There did come a point where I was stunned I still had faith. This was about five years ago. I felt like a fortress that had been bombed but now I was aware of this abyss below my foundation. I no longer had any idea what my faith stood on even though it remained standing.

Now I feel like the dust from that destruction is clearing away. As it clears away, all I'm seeing is a desire to not lose what I had. I don't want to stop believing. I don't want to let go of my habits of going to Mass and confession. I don't even know how to live my life another way. 

I can't answer why there's something rather than nothing. God, in some mysterious sense, must exist, and I still want to believe that the Word became flesh. I still feel that Christ's teachings are important. 

But there's something seriously wrong with the Catholic Church. 

I was raised not to be a Cafeteria Catholic. I was raised that you have to accept it all or you're just making up what you want to believe in and not what's been revealed. You don't get to pick and choose because if it's true, it's all true. So therefore if any bit of it is false, it's all false?

I don't know. Maybe that logic is flawed. Maybe I've been too judgmental of Cafeteria Catholics. Maybe Cafeteria Catholics are the ones with amazing faith.

I feel alone. I feel like people who haven't been here have no idea what this is really like and thus don't know what to say. But they want to save people, so they say stupid things that only hurts things more.

I also feel like if I can somehow persevere in faith through this, I'd be better at reaching fallen away Catholics because I actually *get* it. But where is my person like that? Where is my person to look up to? Where is the person who's supposed to inspire my faith?

I'll go to confession again this weekend and probably cry. I'll just admit that there are some sins I can't make sense of and I don't have enough faith to believe with certainty that they're sinful to motivate myself to stop. And I don't know if that will be enough, but the alternative for me to to feel like the whole Church is a farse. I'd rather believe the Church can be wrong than to lose all faith, but I don't know if I can do that either. I'm just lost and going through the motions. I don't want to let go.",Catholicism

This hatred I had towards Pope Francis,Bergogli-yolk,1626445353,"I kept seeing all these Mortu Propio news and I see everyone being sad, disappointed, or even angry. I even saw one Facebook page that changed their pfp to black because of the news.

And all this makes me wanna join in with this ""hate"" bandwagon, like being mad at him because he did this, to the point where I didn't include him in my prayers because I thought he has crossed the line.

This isn't the first time I felt like this. This happens everytime Pope Francis does something ""stupid"" (i.e Panchamama, the one where we thought he supports same-sex marriage in that one documentary when really it was just a misunderstanding, the James Martin letter, etc.). But this is the only time where I didn't include him in our rosary, and I felt negative feelings the whole time while praying.

But I had this talk with a friend who told me that I should still pray for him despite all this. And I did. The Church has been through rough times and it's still standing after all, it's not the end of the world. That's when I realized that I'm only mad because everyone else is mad and I'm afraid to stand out and thought it's foolish for me to like him despite all the ""stupid"" decisions he made.

What to do with a sign from God,josh901955,1626443637,"Hello my this happened two days ago. Me(18) and my dad(49) drinking as we are both off work. As it was getting late into the night we started discussing  the philosophy of God and Jesus. With me arguing for God and him arguing against. (Playing devil’s advocate). As we were getting into discussion we were talking about Jesus on the cross and I said 

“why would a man do everything he done if he was just a man” 
 
“well he thought he was the son of God”

“Was he not?”

“Well I can’t say that, you go to hell if you say that”

“Say it if you think Jesus wasn’t the Son of God ”

“No he wasn’t the son of God” after saying this my father said he felt an intense sensation of something  like a wind in his body or a ghost walking through him He then retracted his statement. Before and said 
“No Jesus was the son of God” he was truly shook up and scared,he told me what happened and I was was amazed. My dad couldn’t believe that he felt something like that but he thinks it had to be something beyond science,which is something you don’t hear a physicist say.He has never felt anything like that in his life.I said it could have been the Holy Spirit but I don’t know we both believe it was a sign from God not to doubt Jesus Christ as our lord.I was especially thankful Because I had previously prayed to God to send my Dad a sign and it feels like a prayer answered. He went to bed saying God is real. Now I know we were drinking but we have had a drink many times in our life’s and never anything like this it was nothing to do with the alcohol.

Advice for a life less ordinary,Howiethegirl,1626442921,"I am not 1000% sure this is the right place to post this, but here it goes.

I have some neurological issues that made it impossible for me to work full time up until a couple years ago (I found a treatment that worked). To say that God totally used this to my benefit and to the benefit of His Church is a total understatement. While it makes life more difficult, I am thankful for my issues and thankful for how it has shaped my life and ministry.

This past year, which was actually my first working a whole school year full time after having a full summer off (basically as good as it gets), I realized that in order to work full time, my ministry through my church as well as through my life (prayer, how I treat others etc.) were all falling and going by the wayside because I was just too tired and grouchy for anything but my job.

So I’ve decided to put my career second and go back to part time, renew my dedication to my Special needs ministry as well as my participation in other ministries at my church and participate in daily Mass (or as often as possible, but right now I haven’t been at all, so it is still better). I am 100% sure this is the right choice, even though I know it is counter to pretty much EVERYTHING our culture tells us to aim for. I feel that peaceful feeling that happens sometimes when it’s a Holy Spirit kind of decision, even though it is not a typical lifestyle and I don’t know what the future will hold.

My question/plea for advice is: I am fortunate enough that I have a roof over my head at a tiny cost, but are there any ideas on how to sustain this Christ-centered life financially?

Question about Anointing of the Sick,WinterBourne25,1626440558," 

My dad has gone through a lot the past 14 months since his brain cancer diagnosis, including covid, which is when we almost lost him. It's truly a miracle he didn't die. None of his doctors thought he would make it. They tried to get me to sign a DNR. I didn't sign it, and he survived. This all happened at the peak of his cancer treatment. It wasn't until after this crisis happened and my head was in a less reactionary mode that I realized that I never even thought of about his final sacrament. Keep in mind this was all during the height of Covid and we weren't even attending Mass in person. My mom and I were sitting at home constantly waiting for the phone to ring. We weren't even allowed to enter the hospital because of Covid. 

Fast forward to now and to make a long story short, I found out this week that his cancer is growing again. We are going to go back to chemo therapy, and then a stem cell transplant. It is a very rare an aggressive cancer. The treatments will also be very aggressive. I'm going there to help my parents (who are in their 70s and don't have other family nearby) through this again.

My questions: Should I reach out to their parish and ask about anointing of the sick? At what point should we have this done? I'd like to have a plan before I'm heavily into his treatment or before things turn for the worse, if they do. 

All prayers are appreciated. May God give me the strength and grace to get through this again.",Catholicism
Did the apostles believe Jesus would return in their lifetime?,ActiveHuckleberry9,1626440474,"Bart Ehrman claims the early clearly Christians believed it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Paul thought the end was coming in his lifetime. Nowhere is this more clear  than in 1 Thessalonians. Paul wrote to the Christians in Thessalonica  because some of them had become disturbed over the death of a number of  their fellow believers. When he converted these people, Paul had taught  them that the end of the age was imminent and that they were to enter  the kingdom when Jesus returned, but members of the congregation had  died before it happened.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paul  wrote to assure the survivors that even those who have died will be  brought into the kingdom. In fact, when Jesus returns in glory on the  clouds of heaven, ""the dead in Christ will rise first; then **we who are alive, who remain**, will be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air"" (4:17).

Answer on Quora 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;After the time of Paul, the first we hear of the return of Jesus is in Mark’s  Gospel. In Chapter 13, Jesus tells us that he would return on “clouds  of glory” within the lifetimes of some of those to whom he was speaking.  
&gt;  
&gt;It  was becoming embarrassingly apparent that the prophecy of Jesus’  imminent return had not been fulfilled. The Second Epistle of Paul to  the Thessalonians was written pseudepigraphically — as if by Paul — to  suggest that an earlier epistle (*1 Thessalonians*), claiming that Jesus would soon return, was a forgery and should be ignored (2 Thessalonians 2:2):  
&gt;  
&gt;That  ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor  by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at  hand. That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by  spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ  is at hand.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;It  seems that even towards the middle of the second century, this prophecy  was still causing embarrassment, with “scoffers” demanding to know the  answer (2 Peter 2:3–4):  
&gt;  
&gt;Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, And saying, **Where is the promise of his coming?** for since the fathers fell asleep, **all things continue as they were** from the beginning of the creation. 

&amp;#x200B;

These verses seems to say so.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; "" Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away before all these things take place.  31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. **(Mark 13:30-31)** 

 

&gt;"" Truly, I say to you,  there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see  the Son of man coming in his kingdom.” ” **(Matthew 16:28)** 

 

&gt;When they persecute  you in one town, flee to the next; for truly, I say to you, you will not  have gone through all the towns of Israel, before the Son of man comes. **(Matthew 10:23)**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Immediately after the tribulation of  those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its  light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the  heavens will be shaken;  30 then  will appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then all the  tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of man coming  on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory;  31 and  he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will  gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the  other.32 “From  the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and  puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.  33 So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates.  34 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all these things take place. **(Matthew 24:29-34)**

Morality Quandry: Mom wants to marry deadbeat boyfriend in order to switch to best health insurance for cancer treatment,OG_BenchLegs,1626438974,"My mom recently discovered that she has a tumor on her lung. We’re waiting for her to have a biopsy done so she can receive a formal diagnosis about what kind of lung/pulmonary cancer she has. One of the issues we’ve discussed is getting to a top lung cancer treatment center because her health insurance option is crap and wouldn’t cover her out-of-state medical expenses. She had a better insurance option a few years ago and switched over because she couldn’t find a doctor who was willing to continue prescribing her the proper anxiety medication. Where my mom works, there’s an annual option transfer open season, but that’s not until late Fall. Hypothetically, she could wait til then to change over, but with lung cancer, ""waiting"" can quickly become ""terminal"". Yesterday, she realized she has the potential to cite a “qualifying event” (which would allow her to pick an option transfer at the time of said “qualifying event”): marrying her boyfriend.

 This has set off all the alarms for me. Now, before I dive in, let me stress that I am aware that my mom’s decision is hers to make. I don’t feel I have a right to demand differently from her, but I also know from the way she approached the subject with me (she hasn’t mentioned anything to her boyfriend yet), she greatly values my outlook. Before I can share my outlook on this, I need to provide the background.

 My mom has consistently said she didn’t want to get married again, and especially not to him. My mom’s boyfriend and his son live with her, and she has consistently vented about how he and his son are a burden more than a help (her boyfriend does not have a real/full-time job, but does landscaping and tile delivery for his brother’s contracting business “as the seasons allow”, and at that, only when there’s an actual job needs done). It seems clear to me that there’s no real love in the relationship, and she has been saying for the last three to four years that she wants to break up with him and tell him to move out, but she never ripped the band-aid off. Never minding his spotty employment, I’ve never believed he was a good fit for her. He’s more or less a rambling dullard (he literally rambles for extended periods of time) and a recovering alcoholic who claims to have reformed from a life of street violence and spent many years in and out of the system. He has no education and no prospect for real, gainful employment, and he genuinely seems to have a low IQ. And he has a general outlook and approach to life that I can only describe as “white trash”. I suppose none of these are problems in themselves outright, but my mom is a hard-working, six-figure-earning professional woman with an exceptional IQ who has never had problems with the law, or drugs, or alcohol. To put it mildly, they’re not well-yoked.

 It's not just this way in terms of the secular aspects of life. My mom is finally rediscovering the Christian faith (Lutheran, but I’m working on being the best Catholic example I can be 😊), and I have been going over to pray together with her nightly. This guy claims to be Christian and that God was the one who healed him of his alcoholism, but to hear him speak about religion and faith, his outlook on all of it is deeply impaired, and he constantly sets a poor example in his words and deeds. And he certainly doesn’t pray with my mom, or pray together with us when I come over. I guess this is all circumstantial, but I wanted to paint a clear picture of the disparity between these two people to provide as much context as possible.

 Before returning to the faith, my mom was a pagan. This aspect of her life never personally had a negative affect on her, me, or our relationship, so I never judged her for it or thought twice about it. If my mom was still pagan, I might chalk this marriage idea up to “it is what it is”, but now that she’s Christian, I feel compelled to stress the significance of the institution of marriage.

 I love my mom with all my heart. I want her to survive her cancer. I want her to get the absolute best treatment she can receive as quickly as she can receive it. But more than this, I want her to come into the fullness of the faith with both eyes open, and I don’t want her to do anything that might become a spiritual stumbling block. Whenever her time comes, whether it be next year or in thirty years, I want to see her having lived a morally good life as best she could for the remainder of her life. Because I know that the catalyst and near-singular reason for her considering marrying this man is the benefit of the health insurance option transfer, I can’t help but see it as a bastardization of the institution of marriage, and one that would inevitably offend God, even if it was done merely in the courts and not in a Church. Even then, it feels like taking legal advantage of the good faith of the courts, which can’t be a great thing to do, ethically. I just don’t want her to do anything that will become a stumbling block for her.

Where I’m at right now is that if she does this, I do not think I can give her my sonly blessing. I will continue to do everything as we have done, I will not look at her differently or think less of her (I only ever want the absolute best for her), but I don’t think I can be present for the event itself or pretend I’d be okay with it.

"With God's Grace, Everything Gets Better!",PencilScratches,1626438419,"Hello, it's been a while since I last posted here. Three months ago I was at the lowest point of my life. In the midst of a pandemic I lost my job.  I didn't even bother seeking God and identified as Agnostic. Then previous mistakes came to haunt me too which caused me to be shunned by my community and lose the respect of friends and colleagues. From the experience ,I suffered from paranoia and anxiety. I was in constant fear that grad school might not accept me anymore after getting doxed. I was afraid to disappoint my parents if they find out what happened to me. I was afraid that I might never get a job ever again. It felt like the world was crashing down on me. I didn't even see myself as human. I was alone. 

Or so I thought I was. 

Despite that I've driven myself away from him for years, Jesus still welcomed me back after seeking him. He was my strength when I was weak. He was my courage when I was in a constant state of fear. To Him I surrendered everything and trusted Him. I prayed the rosary every night. I prayed for the intercession of Saints particularly of Saints Jude Thaddeus, Expedite, and Bakhita. I prayed with hope that things will be better eventually and all of these shall pass.

It did. 

Three months later, within one week, all of my prayers were answered. My parents are not disappointed of me. I got a new job in a Catholic School. I received an email that my profs are anticipating my return to grad school.  Now I'm writing this to bear witness that if you keep The Faith then God's grace will be bestowed upon you. More than my worldly prayers, God even gave me much more. He gave me the gift of peace. He Himself is a gift.

A portal to hell opened up just outside my neighbor's garage.,NotJoking777,1626436600,"One  day a couple of winters ago I was in the office of my home looking out  the window. It was getting dark outside and my neighbors had their light  on in the garage. There looked to be a black type of screen thing  hanging down right before the garage, which made that part of the garage  look darker. Well, I was looking at it and all of the sudden smoke  appeared, it was circling round and round, just like how your mouse  cursor will circle around when a webpage is loading. But this was of  smoke just circling around, I don't know where it came from.

I  got real scared because a lot of strange stuff had been happening to me  lately and I was like Oh no, here we go again. I closed my eyes for  like 10 seconds because I was scared to keep looking, I peeked my eyes  open for a few seconds and I saw a man with what appeared to be a  machine gun and boxes of ammo standing where the dark screen was. It was  in black and white. I think it was a person that was sent to hell after  doing a terrible shooting.

I  believe for some reason God gave me a vision of hell. I quickly closed  my eyes again and shut the mini-blinds to my window. The next time I  checked out the window nothing was there anymore. Do you think God sometimes gives us visions of heaven or hell? Have you had any unusual experience like this?",Catholicism

You were so numerous to answer to my previous question related to small communities in the past and possibilities to attend mass. I was absolutely flooded with quality explanations and kindness and thank you very much for that.

I do now have another case for my same work project, I guess for you it will be an easy one :-) if you don't mind, could you help me a bit again ?

Imagine are in the 1800s. There is a good sized village with a church with a parish and a priest, basic configuration, and yet, for some reasons linked to industrialization, the village becomes quickly a fairly big city, in like 50 years, and it's now the biggest city around for a while.

- can the authorities decide that the church is too small, and build a cathedral instead because now the place is central and requires a bishop ?

- if a super rich merchant wanted to give all his money to this specific parish, could the parish use the money to construct the said cathedral ? Independently from Rome ?

- If yes, would the priest be dismissed, and a bishop used to be a bishop would be hired, or could the priest become the bishop ? 

Guys once again thank you so much you have no idea how many time you allow me to spare with your precious help. Take care &lt;3

For example, when seeing nudity or people in swimsuit, you may have a desire to look and it gives you a good feeling, but you do not think of doing anything sexual with them in your mind. Is this good feeling sexual arousal? And is the desire to look out of appreciation of beauty? Or curiosity? Or sexual desire? Or maybe a mixture of them?

Post-conversion and I feel trapped,theotokosprayforus,1626419794,"I had an overnight conversion and my world literally turned upside down after a vision I had of Christ. 

Since then, I’ve been trying to navigate my life through such a radically different worldview. 

I was already married by the time I had my encounter with Christ. My husband is non-religious and my newfound faith caused a lot of issues in our marriage. We’ve mostly resolved the issues by just not talking about faith, politics and anything controversial. 

I also have anxiety and PTSD, which do flare up every now and then. 

I’m supposed to start my master’s program this fall. The thing is, I’ve been feeling so drawn to living a simple life with lots of kids and being a housewife. My husband doesn’t want this, as housewives are extremely rare where I live, and having lots of kids is considered strange. Plus, when we got married, I always wanted to work because having a double income household was just always the default. 

So I understand why he doesn’t want me to be a housewife. But he still wants me to get a high paying job with my masters, because he said it’s a big sacrifice for him to support me through school. 

I still struggle with anxiety, even at my current entry level office job. I seriously don’t want a high paying stressful job. 

I feel that I have no choice but to go through with the masters and get a high paying job. I feel so trapped. I guess this is just a rant, I know what the right thing to do is and that is to honour my responsibility as a wife and serve my family with joy and love from the Lord.

I had already chosen through my own free will to mortally sin, perhaps with the knowledge I already mortally sinned in the same way earlier this week. Still, I felt my conscience prick at me and I found myself arguing with God/my conscience. In the end, I stopped because an immense sense of guilt washed over me. I said an act of contrition and resolved to go to confession and placed the image back.

I am a wretched sinner, but God saw fit to keep me from falling even deeper. I know I am estranged from God, but Jesus was still there.",Catholicism

Struggling after my conversion,theotokosprayforus,1626414381,"

I struggle with anxiety and PTSD. Through lots and lots of therapy, I learned that a lot of my anxiety stems from my childhood. Let’s just say that I didn’t grow up in the healthiest household. 

I had a conversion experience over half a year ago and my life instantly changed overnight. I legit went from a suicidal, weekly panic attacks radical Marxist feminist to an occasional panic attacks Jesus freak after this one experience.

Something I’ve been really struggling with is trying to balance out the Lord’s will in my life and the responsibilities I already had prior to my conversion. 

I had my encounter with Christ about half a year after being married. My non-religious husband was quite confused by my overnight conversion. As you can imagine, my new relationship with Christ brought lots of…. new challenges we’ll call them.

Add on top of that, I was already accepted into my master’s program by the time of my conversion. 

The problem is that I am having so many second thoughts about my masters. I’ve been thinking about what’s actually important in life and I feel convicted by my cushy suburban middle class lifestyle. If I go through with my masters, I’ll be able to get a relatively high paying job after I graduate. 

I feel convicted to live a radical life for Christ. A lifestyle where I truly proclaim the gospel. This family I met at my parish has 6 kids and the mom is a housewife. I was so amazed by their lives, cause this is truly radical especially where I live. Being a housewife is unheard of in my city, let alone having 6 kids! 

But my husband doesn’t want me to ever be a housewife. I don’t blame him, because the norm where we live is to both be university educated and have a double income with a couple of kids, live in the suburbs in a nice house with two cars and go on yearly vacations. 

I still struggle with a lot of anxiety, and to be honest, the jobs that my masters offer are all high stress jobs. I’m not at all an ambitious person, and my own entry level job already makes me anxious, so the thought of an even higher position is super unappealing to me. I told this to my husband recently and he asked me why I’m going to do my masters then. He said that it’s a lot of sacrifice for him to support me through school, and if I don’t end up getting a job that requires a masters, then what was the point? My masters is starting this September and I already informed my current job, so if I don’t start my masters, I won’t have a job to do. 

I just feel lost right now, I don’t know what to do. I feel like I don’t have a choice, I need to get my masters and get a high paying job. I don’t feel like I can discuss much with my husband anymore, our priorities are just so different and religion is just a topic of contention between us.

I realized something today.,coffeeandicons,1626406649,"Hear me out, friends - I’ve been feeling a little low for the past while, and I was ruminating on why that is.

When I was an atheist, there was nothing that irked me more than when Catholics (and other Christians; of course, I lumped them all together) talked about being suppressed or generally mistreated by the world at large. I didn’t see Christians as a community of people of all origins, races, and countries. I saw them as privileged, blue-eyed white folks living in the Bible Belt of America. I saw them as whiny bigots. I am ashamed to admit it, but I am now on the other side of the fence and dealing with those same types of attitudes.

Coming to Catholicism, I was struck at how HATED the Church is. I would guess that probably 50% of my old friends and acquaintances do not even speak with me anymore. My own family (being very progressive on certain social issues), has repeatedly stated how much they oppose Catholicism. I stand firm in the teachings of the Church and that’s an issue with them, so I stopped bringing it up. And, more recently (due to what has happened in Canada), I have seen people openly talk about how much they want to see churches burned, both on social media and in person. A good friend of mine even spoke about wishing torment and death on Catholics because of the residential school situation. She didn’t seem to understand why I was appalled until I talked to her about it. The hatred is constant. 

It boggles my mind that secular culture can claim that Christians and Catholics alike do not face any persecution, while simultaneously encouraging the burning of 17 churches. While having it engrained in our culture that priests are predators. It drives me insane to be part of a culture that is obsessed with progressive values and equality, while it simultaneously excludes an entire group of people from that equation. 

The more I embrace the faith, the more I feel a deeper divide between me and the culture at large. Between me and my family. I know that we are to be in the world and not of it, but that doesn’t change how hard it can be. It almost feels like being on the edge of the cliff. To take the plunge, to completely immerse myself in the faith, means I can’t return to the safety of the shore. 

But I’m tired. Tired of feeling like I should hide my faith. Tired of feeling obligated to have society’s approval. Tired of feeling that I should censor myself for the sake of a culture that does not care for our ways. 

This season of life, if anything, has caused me to meditate upon Matthew‬ ‭10:34-39‬ in a new way. We are not guaranteed earthly peace in this life. And to follow Jesus is not the easy path. Even though these days are very difficult for us Catholics, there is a lot we can learn from it. We can take these hardships and make them our motivation to pursue Jesus.

I understand the whole “sex is for procreation not pleasure” thing, but I feel that I can love my adopted kids as much as any biological kids. And then even worse is the conversion therapy that is forced on kids, like you aren’t gonna change someone’s sexuality via outside forces unless you abuse them and cause scarring trauma. Their sexuality will develop naturally unless there is abuse.

Western traditions that pre-date eastern traditions?,Kam-Trax,1626399841,"Hello there,

I often come into contact with a lot of criticisms from eastern Christians (both orthodox and byzantine catholic) about how many eastern traditions pre date western traditions. Essentially, how Rome was the Innovator of a lot of ""novelties"" in its spiritual expression throughout the years. Examples usually given will be things like pouring for baptism instead of full submersion, communion of one kind, the way confession is administered, etc. Some of these critiques could be correctly labeled as ""innovations"", however, I was wondering what traditions the west has, that pre date certain eastern traditions. Obviously, no church is free of novelty- we all have devised different liturgical, and overall, spiritual traditions. So I'm not saying ""all novelty is bad"". As a byzantine catholic, I always hear a lot of things the west has done that many eastern brothers and sisters will call ""non apostolic"", however I wanted to hear from western brothers and sisters what the west does traditionally speaking, that is not just apostolic, but something the east doesn't do despite all its apostolic traditions.

Advice for telling others in my life about discernment.,integral_catholic,1626399645,"X-post from r/moderndaysaints

Hello r/Catholicism

I am discerning a possible vocation with the Legion of Christ, a religious order made up of priests.

(For background, I am also discerning a vocation with the Dominicans and Glenmary Home Missionaries)

If you know anything about the Legion, you know that there is much scandal surrounding the evil actions of their founder.  

Because of this, I am afraid and ashamed to tell anyone that I believe I might have a vocation with them.  My parents, my friends, even my confessor and other priests.  I don’t want them to look with judgement, refuse to help me discern, or worse, think I am a pedophile.

 Someone I know says it isnt always a sin if you kill a "" bad person"" and that it's ok to take justice on your own hands esp if no authority is going to seek justice.

I say killing for revenge is always a sin. Because vengeance belongs to God and even if we don't get justice in this world we should try  through the proper channels.

Question about asking a priest to a non-Catholic funeral service.,CateB9,1626390503,"I'll preface this and say no one has passed, I'm just trying to make plans for the inevitable future. 

My parents have recently made their afterlife plans. There is a nearby Veteran's Cemetery (my dad was in Vietnam) that they are set up with. It is nice because they handle everything, so when my parents do pass I have very little to do in terms of planning. However, recently my mother expressed a little disappointment that she will not have a traditional Catholic funeral because religious services are not part of the cemetery's services. 

It is possible to still have a priest come to the service she will have? Even if it just to bless the grave or her in the casket? Would I ask the priest at her church or from a nearby church? The cemetery is about a 30 minute drive in moderate traffic away from her church. 

I'm  also aware that there is an expectation of a monetary compensation for the priest's services, will the priest tell me exactly how much he expects or is it up to me to guess? What is typical for these situations?

Thank you all in advanced. I want to tell my mom about what the options are so that she can feel a little better about not having a traditional catholic funeral.",Catholicism

"Catholicism, its rituals and ""mental illness""",bebopdebs,1626388691,"Most people dont get it. To start Ill say that the catholic church is created the way it is to give you the best chance at fighting against any afflictions and darkness that may enter your life. Thats why everything has a purity aspect, so that when you reach for it you dont find a person with sin but instead a priest who is suppose to be christs reflection. Therefore whatever ritual you went through was purest in its form. Thats for starters. Second the congregation. The congregation is there so that in your battle against afflictions, in your darkest moments you can remember the strength and love of your congregation. The holding hands and the raising of them in unison in something you can reach to to pull yourself out of a dark situation. Be grateful to have them.  Heres the thing, just like a child needs to be given natural child birth to remember the trauma he went through with his mother to bond the two, breast feeding need also take place to strengthen the bond for the child to reach to. Many people who suffer from ""schizophrenia"" do not have a base to reach to. They cant just eat christ dying on the cross and their mannerisms remind me of a child with his eyes twirling around and fingers flickering. reaching for his mothers bottle. From anxiety to the worst forms of afflictions by monsters who have fed off of other people and sought to kill without killing, they have sent people to their death. They have eaten and fed off of people instead of eating christ. Instead of eating his death on the cross. They continue  eating and feeding off of others. With even minor rapes and abuses. Yes this is even what the school bully is doing. This is why the school shooter will be forgiven before the bully. They kill them physically and spiritually. The church is supposed to be the counter rituals for those afflictions. In the darkest reccesses of the world of mental illness there are people who will create the same sound hundreds of times a day, they will physically touch you in the same places, They will scream the same words they want you to hear them saying, they want to kill you at every turn. They feed. They look for reactions to land the killing blows, they make it so that when you feel afflicted or start going dark you cant reach for gods word because they have screamed it, you cant reach for a noise because they have repeated it, you cant reach for you body because they have abused it. You hear them screaming in the dark and cursing, being perverted and doing countless drugs and drinking. Looking for those to feed off of. They dont reach for christ to eat the drink of his death so instead they feed of the drink of the slow killing of the people around them. This is the world you live in. Survival of the fittest is no more than the lie of the devil. Whether your head is afflicted or your right or left, whether your feet or chest was afflicted, whether its hard to keep writing or walking because the darkness of afflictions comes in remember that christ walked in the darkness and died on the cross and rose again.",Catholicism

This is a reply to the age-old question: Why doesn't God intervene to stop suffering?,zogins,1626384201,"I was watching a wildlife documentary with my young son. A lion was chasing a zebra, which it finally caught. My son was a little distressed and he asked me why people did not intervene to stop the 'cruelty' instead of just filming.

I tried to explain that it would be impossible to stop all lions from attacking their prey. Which lions do we stop? What would those lions eat? Our interference would create chaos.

Very often we hear people say things like 'Why did God let that man die?"" The world is based on the rules of nature and evolution. God cannot constantly intervene as it would create chaos and an unpredictable world. What we see as 'cruel' may have consequences that we cannot understand. For example, predators lke lions, are actually beneficial to their prey populations because they weed out the weaker members of the group and push the prey species to 'improve'.

We see things that are hard to understand like starving children in Africa. Someone explained to me that such things are the consequences of sin. Let me make it clear that it is not God who makes these things happen. The governments of some countries use the funds which the country has to buy weapons and fight useless wars instead of feeding their people. Think about it: what would you expect God to do in the short term? With the help of our prayers, He may move the hearts of the politicians, Missionaries from many Catholic orders go to these places, risking everything, and tend to the needs of these people.

I am from a small country but since we were little children we were always encouraged to do little things to help other children. We collected anything from used stamps to cans of food. Every family is encouraged to remotely adopt a child. We pay a sum every month that goes directly to a Maltese priest running something like an orphanage, a school or a hospital.

Struggling with Suffering,epcot32,1626380089,"Hi everyone, I’d appreciate thoughts on a matter testing my faith. It concerns suffering - not mine, but my wife’s cousin’s.

This poor lady has experienced multiple miscarriages and tremendous trouble conceiving. She thankfully had one child about five years ago, and she recently became pregnant with another. However, during the second trimester, her ultrasounds began revealing issues that led her doctors to forecast a minuscule likelihood of safe birth and a high likelihood of permanent disabilities in the event of a safe birth. The doctors actually recommended an abortion, but fortunately she decided against that.

Throughout her ordeal, my wife and I prayed for a safe, healthy birth if it accorded with God’s will. We prayed daily at home and weekly at Mass. For a period of time, her conditions actually improved at a rate that surprised her doctors, granting us palpable hope. However, a couple weeks ago, she ended up miscarrying.

This brings me to my crisis of faith. Why would an all-good, all-loving, all-powerful God allow this poor woman to suffer so much pain and anguish? I’ve considered the possibility her ordeal brings about the “greater good” of reminding her and others to fully appreciate the children they *do* have. However, that only makes me wonder whether an all-powerful God couldn’t create that effect without allowing for so much pain in the process.

I grew up Catholic as a child and went to church pretty much every Sunday since I was a baby. My mother even remembers me belting out in song as a toddler at Mass.  I went to catechism and received my sacraments, in middle school I remember striving to consume less blasphemous content. By late highschool I became agnostic and then in college atheist with a brief stint in spirituality though it was more of an interest. I haven't gone to Mass in years. I still had an odd soft spot for Catholicism  though, I couldn't stand when people would spread misinformation about it. I also feel really drawn to Archangel Raphael and have said if I ever have a son that will be his name even when I said I was and atheist. 

My mother has been a devout Catholic her entire life, as her parents were devout Catholics as well. My dad was raised Catholic and says he was very devout as a child and used to go to confession every week, but growing up he never went to Mass with us and says he believes in God but doesn't agree with the church/organized religion.

Over the past years many people I knew passed away unexpectedly, but the one that got to me last month was the death of a family friend because it was so sudden. A week after she passed I began to have panic attacks from the moment I woke up to when I fell asleep. Fear of death penetrated my mind to my core and I lost all motivation. I told my mother and she told me to turn to God, and I scoffed at the thought in my mind. Still, out of desperation I did end up asking God to show himself to me if he was real but nothing happened. 

One night I was going to say goodnight to my mom and she was already asleep, the TV on still on and playing a clip of a nun speaking. She basically said that we rarely ask the Lord to strengthen our faith for the sake of treating other people better. It clicked to me that I was asking God to appear to me out of fear and selfishness, not to strive to be a better person. The day after that night I felt much better than I had since it started.  I know a lot of this is mostly mental illness as I have suffered from it at a very young age, but I am still in a lot of pain.

However, I would have expected the pope to immediately address the situation in Canada. Instead the Vatican is having Pope Francis visit Canada in December, five months from now.

Hell and the inability to repent.,Uninterrupted-Void,1626368484,"I heard that the reason the people in hell can be justly detained eternally. I understand that it's impossible to repent and want God instead without God's grace urging you to do so. But, is it also impossible for you to WANT to want God?

Let's say there is a person in hell and they are obstinate and love their sin, whatever it is.

What would happen if they cry out: ""God, I love this sin more than I love you, can you please change my mind so I love you more than my sin?""

Would God just stay quiet, saying: ""Times up buddy, NO.""

Or would God say: ""Ok, sure."" But for some reason either:

A: it would never get to this point, because in addition to the sinner not wanting to repent (1st order desire), they can't want to want to repent (2nd order desire).

2: They would be given the grace to repent, but after getting the grace they would get cold feet and say: ""you know what? I changed my mind thanks anyways I'd rather just hang out down here.""

I mourn the loss of the UK's great monasteries.,Watchful_Peregrine,1626367888,"Even as someone whos not a confirmed Catholic, its tears my heart to think of the overwhelming loss that followed Henry VIII's order to dissolve the monasteries. The schism that followed is bad enough, but for the communities to be destroyed, and the great buildings of Whitby, Glastonbury, Fountains, Rievalux, Battle, to be left either to ruin or their stone ransacked to build country houses is a greater spiritual loss that we can come to understand. 

I wonder how different the course of these past 500 years may have been had these places of spiritual education, growth, and influence been standing. Sure, not every community lasts forever, but just to sit amongst the ruins of these places is an experience, I can't imagine what it would have been like to witness them at their height.",Catholicism
20 Pope Francis quotes on key social and spiritual issues in Church and society,Anglicanpolitics123,1626366855,"**(1)** ""Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?""(Mark 4:40). Lord, your word this evening strikes us and regards us, all of us. In this world, that you love more than we do, we have gone ahead at breakneck speed, feeling powerful and able to do anything. Greedy for profit, we let ourselves get caught up in things, and lured away by haste. We did not stop at your reproach to us, we were not shaken awake by wars or injustice across the world, nor did we listen to the cry of the poor or of our ailing planet. We carried on regardless, thinking we would stay healthy in a world that was sick. Now that we are in a stormy sea, we implore you: ""Wake up, Lord!""\_Christ in the Storm(Urbi et Orbi 2020)

**(2)** ""Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?"". Faith begins when we realize we are in need of salvation. We are not self-sufficient; by ourselves we founder: we need the Lord, like ancient navigators needed the stars. Let us invite Jesus into the boats of our lives. Let us hand over our fear to him so that he can conquer them. Like the disciples, we will experience that with him on board there will be no shipwreck. Because this is God's strength: turning to the good everything that happens to us, even the bad things. He brings serenity into our storms, because with God life never dies""\_Christ in the Storm(Urbi et Orbi 2020)

**(3)** ""You have to go to the edges of existence if you want to see the world as it is. I've always thought that the world looks clearer from the periphery, but in these last seven years as Pope, it has really hit home. You have to make for the margins to find a new future. When God wanted to regenerate creation, he chose to go to the margins-to the place of sin and misery, of exclusion and suffering, of illness and solitude-because they were also the places full of possibility: 'where sin increased, grace abounded all the more'(Romans 5:20)""\_Let us Dream(The path to a better future)

**(4)**""Some respond to the suffering of a crisis with a shrug. They say 'God made the world that way, that's just how it is'. But such a response misinterprets God's creation as static, when it's a dynamic process. The world is always being made. Paul in his Letter to the Romans 8:22 says creation is groaning from birth pangs. God wants to bring forth the world with us, as partners, continually. He has invited us to join him from the very beginning, in peaceful times and in times of crisis-at all times. It's not like we've been handed this thing all wrapped up and sealed: 'Here, have the world'""\_Let us Dream(The path to a better future)

**(5)**""Look at us now: we put face masks to protect ourselves and others from a virus we can't see. But what about all those other unseen viruses we need to protect ourselves from? How will we deal with the hidden pandemics of this world, the pandemics of hunger and violence and climate change? If we are to come out of this crisis less selfish than we went in, we have to let ourselves be touched by other's pain""\_Let us Dream(The path to a better future)

**(6)**""The best way to dominate and gain control over people is to spread despair and discouragement, even under the guide of defending certain values. Today, in many countries, hyperbole, extremism and polarization have become political tools. Employing a strategy of ridicule, suspicion and relentless criticism, in a variety of ways one denies the right of others to exist or to have an opinion. Their share of the truth and their values are rejected and as a result, the life of society is impoverished and subjected to the hubris of the powerful""\_Fratelli Tutti(prg 15)

**(7)**""I sometimes wonder why....it took so long for the Church unequivocally to condemn slavery and various forms of violence. Today, with our developed spirituality and theology, we have no excuses. Still, there are those who appear to feel encouraged or at least permitted by their faith to support varieties of narrow and violent nationalism, xenophobia and contempt, and even the mistreatment of those who are different. Faith, and the humanism it inspires, must maintain a critical sense in the face of these tendencies, and prompt an immediate response whenever they rear their head""\_Fratelli Tutti(prg 86)

**(8)** ""Of those who have endured much unjust and cruel suffering, a sort of 'social forgiveness' must not be demanded. Reconciliation is a personal act, and no one can impose it upon an entire society, however great the need to foster it. In a strictly personal way, someone by a free and generous decision, can choose not to demand punishment(Mt 5:44-46) even if it is quite legitimately demanded by society and its justice system. However it is not possible to proclaim a 'blanket reconciliation' in an effort to bind wounds by decree or to cover injustices in a cloak of oblivion. Who can claim the right to forgive in the name of others? It is moving to see forgiveness shown by those who are able to leave behind the harm they suffered, but it is also humanly understandable in the case of those who cannot""\_Fratelli Tutti(prg 246)

**(9)** ""I prefer a Church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security. I do not want a Church concerned with being at the centre and then ends by being caught up in a web of obsessions and procedures..More than by fear of going astray, my hope is that we will be moved by the fear of remaining shut up within structures which give us a false sense of security, within rules which make us harsh judges, within habits which make us feel safe, while at our door people are starving and Jesus tire of saying to us 'Give them something to eat'""\_Evangelii Gaudium(prg 49)

**(10)** ""In some people we see an ostentatious preoccupation for liturgy, for doctrine and for the Church's prestige, but without any concern that the Gospel have a real impact on God's faithful people and the concrete needs of the present time. In this way, the life of the Church turns into a museum piece or something which is the property of a select few. In others, this spiritual worldliness lurks behind a fascination with social and political gain, or pride in their ability to manage practical affairs, or an obsession with programmes of self help and self realization. It can also translate into a concern to be seen, into a social life full of appearances, meetings, dinners, receptions.. It can also lead to a business mentality, caught up with management, statistics, plans and evaluations whose principal beneficiary is not God's people but the Church as an institution. They mark of Christ, incarnate, crucified, and risen is not present; closed and elite groups are formed...\_Evangeli Gaudium(prg 95)

**(11)** ""We have created new idols. The worship of the ancient golden calf(Ex 32:1-35) has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking a truly human purpose""\_Evangelii Gaudium(prg 55)

**(12)** ""It is true that 'the scourge of sexual abuse of minors is, and historically has been, a widespread phenomenon in all cultures and societies; especially within families and in various institutions; its extent has become known primarily 'thanks to changes in public opinion'. Even so, this problem, while it is universal and 'gravely affects our societies as a whole.....is in no way less monstrous when it takes place within the Church'. Indeed, 'in people's justice anger, the Church sees the reflection of the wrath of God, betrayed and insulted""\_Christus Vivit(prg 96)

**(13)** ""Although many young people are happy to see a Church that is humble yet confident in her gifts and capable of offering fair and fraternal criticism, others want a Church that listens more, that does more than simply condemn the world. They do not want to see a Church that is silent and afraid to speak, but neither one that is always battling obsessively over two or three issues. To be credible to young people, there are times when she needs to regain her humility and simply listen, recognizing that what others have to say can provide some light to help her better understand the Gospel. A Church always on the defensive, which loses her humility and stops listening to others, which leaves no room for questions, loses her youth and turns into a museum""\_Christus Vivit(prg 41)

**(14)** ""There are those who believe that many of today's problems have arisen because of feminine emancipation. This argument, however, is not valid: it is false, untrue, a form of male chauvinism. The equal dignity of men and women makes us rejoice to see old forms of discrimination disappear, and within families there is a growing reciprocity. If certain forms of feminism have arisen which we must consider inadequate, we must nonetheless see in the women's movement the working of the Spirit for a clear recognition of the dignity and rights of women""\_Amoris Laetitia(prg 54)

**(15)** ""The sexual exploitation of children is yet another scandalous and perverse reality in present-day society. Societies experiencing violence due to war, terrorism or the presence of organised crime are witnessing the deterioration of the family, above all in large cities where on their outskirts, the so-called phenomenon of 'street children' is on the rise. The sexual abuse of children is all the more scandalous when it occurs in places where they ought to be most safe, particularly in families, schools, communities and Christian institutions""\_Amoris Laetitia(prg 45)

**(16)** ""We need to feel outrage, as Moses did(Ex 11:8), as Jesus did(Mk 3:5) as God does in the face of injustice. It is not good for us to become inured to evil; it is not good when our social consciousness is dulled before 'an exploitation that is leaving destruction and even death throughout our region...jeopardizing the lives of millions of people and especially the habitat of peasants and indigenous peoples""\_Querida Amazonia(prg 15)

**(17)** The businesses, national or international, which harm the Amazon and fail to respect the right of the \[indigenous\] peoples to the land and its boundaries and to self-determination and prior consent should be called for what they are: *injustice and crime*: When certain businesses out for quick profit appropriate lands and end up privatizing even potable water, or when local authorities give free access to timber companies, mining or oil projects, and other businesses that raze the forests and pollute the environment, economic relationships are unduly altered and become and instrument of death.....we cannot allow globalization to become a 'new verse of colonialism'""\_Querida Amazonia(prg 14)

**(18)** ""The external deserts in the world are growing because the internal deserts have become so vast. For this reason, the ecological crisis is also a summons to a profound interior conversion. It must be said that some committed and prayerful Christians, with the excuse of realism and pragmatism, tend to ridicule expressions of concern for the environment. Others are passive; they choose not to change their habits and thus become inconsistent. So what they all need is an ""ecological conversion"" whereby the effects of their encounter with Jesus Christ become evident in their relationship with the world around them. Living our vocation to be protectors of God's handiwork is essential to a life of virtue; it is not an optional or secondary aspect of our Christian experience""\_Laudato Si(prg 217)

**(19)** ""Intergenerational solidarity is not optional but is rather a basic question of justice, since the world we have received also belongs to those who will follow us. The Portuguese bishops have called upon us to acknowledge this obligation of justice: 'The environment is part of a logic of receptivity. It is on loan to each generation, which must then hand it on to the next'. An integral ecology is marked by this broader vision""\_Laudato Si(prg 159)

**(20)** ""Without truth, love is incapable of establishing a firm bond; it cannot liberate our isolated ego or redeem it from the fleeting moment in order to create and bear fruit. It love needs truth, truth also needs love. Love and truth are inseparable. Without love, truth becomes cold, impersonal and oppressive for people's day to day lives. The truth we seek, the truth that gives meaning to our journey through life, enlightens us whenever we are touched by love. One who loves realizes that love is an experience of truth, that it opens our eyes to see reality in a new way, in union with the beloved""\_Lumen Fidei(prg 27)",Catholicism

Some questions regarding Catholic events and structure,KingOfBurrito,1626360745,"Hi everyone,
To preface, I am not a religious person but I do have an interest in learning and understanding other people and groups outside my own sphere.

I am currently writing a novel, in which some aspects of the story centre around a fictional St Luke the Evangelist Catholic church on the south coast of England (in a fictional town near Brighton). I have a couple of questions to help guide my understanding of Catholic aspects in a respectful manner.

Firstly, is the Assumption of Mary (August 15th) observed in England? If so, how? Is there a mass on that date?

Secondly, would someone please give a quick overview of church ""ranks""? I'm not sure of the specifics of what constitutes priests, bishops, etc. Specifically, what sort of ""ranks"" would likely be present in a small-town Catholic church, and how would they be addressed - is ""father"" the correct title for a priest?

And thirdly, is there any other useful information that I may inadvertently overlook?

"East, West, and the Pope",Kerghan1218,1626359786,"I saw a post over on Catholic memes about the filioquae, and there was a pretty good descriptor of the what and why in the comments section. One of the points mentioned, though, was the division over Papal authority.

That got me thinking, what exactly is the Church teaching regarding His Holiness's, well, holiness?

He is a man. Who is elected to a position by other men. The job in practicum has an administrative and political component, but I was always under the impression that there was some implicit Divinity to the title as well. Not all Popes are Saints, and I think an objective historical analysis would suggest that some were legitimately... less than great.  

Jesus was the true high priest, and even touching his garments in faith bestowed healing. I have seen images of people treating the Pope in a similar context at public gatherings. Yet he is a successor of Peter, not Jesus...

Is this a ""the Holy Spirit guides holy men through holy meditation to pick the best person for the job at the time"" kind of thing?  Or is the teaching that he literally has some sliver of Authority in a divine context?

I can see where one of those definitions would cause a pretty significant schism. The other one seems to me to be a theological triviality, though I know wars have been fought over less.

Has Anyone Felt Like This Before?,ClassicGalactic,1626329227,"I've been thinking about what It would be like to be sent to be Judged before God. The Throne, any Angels, seeing Jesus, Mary, or Angels like my guardian angels for the first time. And it terrifies me. And if Angels look like the biblically accurate ones that I've seen art of on the internet, then I don't even know how I would react...

I would feel so awkward, me, an underserving sinner who's just another Mortal Human, being in the presence of God himself. How would I even be sent to be judged?

Would my guardian Angel come and carry my soul to God? Do I just appear right after I die? What happens?

I dread the pains of Purgatory, even though I know that I need it to be purified. How long would I even be in there?

What would I say to my Guardian Angel? Would I even be allowed to talk to St. Michael, and all the other Angels? What do we even do in Heaven? How would I even talk to an Angel that has always been there with me, and probably even watched me use the restroom, while just sitting there saying nothing.

But the scariest part of it all, would be the Judgement...

I just hope I never hear the words: ""DEPART FROM ME, YE CURSED! INTO EVERLASTING FIRE, PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL, AND HIS ANGELS!""

It's crazy to think about, and I've been taught about the levels of Purgatory in Church school. Even though it's not Hell, it's still gloomy and scary.

Strong Imagination While Praying,ALC8915,1626318457,"Is this normal?

Lately I’ve been doing Divine Mercy Chaplet prayers around 3pm.

Originally I started this devotion for people in my life and for my own salvation.

Lately the thoughts of 9-11 come into my head while meditating this prayer.

I imagine being in the building with these people who suffered in the twin towers and praying over them.  There are some who are afraid and others who accept Christ.  I sing the prayer to them while chaos surrounds us.

Why are Catholics discussing Right-Wing politics under the guise of religion???,ForsakenWind,1626315675,"I have a feeling that outside of the internet, things are much less extreme, but I still think there is a bad political precedent being set in many Catholic communities, especially many of those that I see here on Reddit.

Take [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicMemes/comments/o0sjii/from_political_compass_memes_maybe_it_will_work/) post from r/CatholicMemes for example. I know that obviously this subreddit is not about the most serious discussion of Catholic morality and religion, but surely this post and its comments cross the line somewhere, right? Associating a saint with the ""Authright"" side of the political spectrum already seems like an attempt at validating one's own political opinions by association with the Church, and it is further reinforced by the comparison to the Right-Wing speaker Jordan B. Peterson.

The comments aren't very redeeming either. I could understand people talking about some common topics in Catholicism, like how children deserve to see their parents, and how women are inherently victimized by latchkey-culture, but they are *literally* arguing for a patriarchal, male owned society.

Ultimately, I don't agree or disagree with what they are saying. I'm not a woman, I don't really have a say in the discussion. However, the post I mentioned serves as an excellent example of the growing precedent of discussing politics and other polarizing topics in Catholic communities. Does anybody know why this became so widely accepted? It's incredibly confusing. I've been browsing this subreddit (and related subreddits) for around 2 years now, and all of this is news to me.

I hope I set the tone of this post well. I am not trying to argue about politics, I'm just concerned that political discussion within Catholic circles is bringing a bad / unwelcoming image to Catholicism.",Catholicism

Also, it was said since Jesus hadn't died and been resurrected yet, it couldn't have been his real body. Would an answer to that be that the Eucharistic is ""outside of time""?

Reconnecting with the church,cato888,1626294562,"It's been a while since I attended church, and that was with my family in the town I grew up in. Also, I've never been a deeply religious person. Now, after a few years in college (and not to mention multiple periods of belief and disbelief in God), I'm in a totally different town working on a graduate degree at a big state university in a sort of suburban area. Recently, someone I trust and respect recommended that I attend Sunday mass as a way of meeting people in my community and getting in touch with the religion and God. I'd like to give that a try. 

Unfortunately, I don't know anyone who would be interested in doing that with me, so I'm planning on going alone.

Are my feelings normal?,Amazing_Staff_5837,1626289805,"So most of my christian faith has revolved around calvinism and that's essentially that God chooses everything and every is predetermined. That car that just crashed? Getting abused by your spouse? Fell down stairs? Now of course these are silly examples but you get the point. The theology is that he is the author of everything? Early church being persecuted? planned. This didn't help that Jesus occasionally said threats in the gospel mostly about denying him or being secular and that always concerned me as an American that I am bit too secular. There are warnings in the Bible about habitual sin, you have stories like Anaias and Sapphira where it's implied God killed a couple due to sin.

Now I know this is cherry picking but basically I say this to say that Christianity has always felt like a rule book and legalistic. As someone who struggles with depression and OCD and other problems being told that God is a potential cause didn't make me feel better. I don't feel fatherly love like Christians tell me I should. Do I still believe? Yes because ultimately I believe the Bible is true but just an ugly truth. It's like I'm always waiting for the sky to fall down or for God to send lightning.

Supernatural abilities,Jazzlike-Business2,1626287775,"Hi everyone, hope you are doing well today. I have a question regarding the supernatural. In practically every saint's life, we read about miracles and supernatural abilities of the saint/mystic. For example, Padre Pio had the stigmata, could bi-locate, had the gift of reading souls (cardiognosis), healing, and prophecy. I can think of more saints, but two that come to mind almost immediately are St Thomas Aquinas (mystical experience &amp; knowledge) and St Francis of Assisi (levitation). My observation does not in any way attempt to diminish the significance of these saints' virtue and their outstanding moral character. 

My question is this: how come some people such as the saints mentioned above receive these gifts during their time on earth, and how come others, like ourselves do not? What is it that separates *us* from *them*? Is it a question of merit? And the second question: is it possible for a ""mortal"" to acquire these preternatural abilities? If so, how?

Question about secular music and art,junNyR,1626286568,"I went to confession yesterday with a firm purpose of changing my life, and I'm in doubt about some songs I've been listening.

I like to listen to a lot of metal genres, and in most of them (the ones that don't explicitly offend God or the Church like death/black metal) I don't see something inherently wrong.

There's an album by Angra called Temple of Shadows, that tells a story of a templar knight who is called for a crusade and ends up, due to inner conflicts and things that happened in his life (like the loss of his family), falling in heresy, doubting his devotions and the doctrine of the Church. So some songs express this dellusion and his thoughts about his life and his relationship with God and there's lines across the album like ""Lucifer is just a name, we are the only ones to blame"", ""God has no mind and no heart, has no body, has no soul and no resemblance of you"", ""face the truth, God is not love"", ""God's abandoned this world"", ""only love defies the resurrection"", and so on. There's some notions of pantheism and a lot of other things.

It might seem like a bad album for a catholic person to listen, BUT, it's just a story. It tells a story and I understand it only as a story. When it comes to lyrics, I don't identify with them but I understand them as the story of someone's life and their reflections and enjoy the story behind them. I mostly enjoy the musical part, the instrumental, the arrangements (which are BEAUTIFUL), so much that I've been training some songs on the guitar. It comes to the question of art appreciation for itself, but I'm really concerned about listening to it now, so I want to know what you think.

Noticed a strange trend in some far-left spaces,ard316,1626285558,"I spend time on apps like Tik Tok and Twitter looking at super left-leaning spaces just out of curiosity (which is a separate conversation if that's any good for me haha). Through looking, I have noticed that some on the far left have gone so far in that direction that they have actually come back towards Catholic values, specifically in regards to radical feminism. These are the kind of people who would scoff at the idea of their moral values lining up with the Church in any way but I can't help notice some of the similarities. A lot of these radical thinkers are proposing some ideas that are definitely missing out on some theology but are secular arguments that would still, in my opinion, support Catholic moral teaching. Let me know if you have noticed anything similar or if I'm reaching way too much. Unfortunately, I just noticed this phenomenon and haven't saved any of the posts but I'm sure if you look into these spaces you could find them as well.

I summarized a few of their arguments just as examples:

1. Anti-Contraceptives. These women are arguing that contraceptives, specifically hormonal birth control, has been extremely detrimental to women. The big point they make is obviously how hurtful this medication can be to the woman's body (weight gain, mood swings, migraines, blood clots, cancer, etc.). Almost every woman has a friend, or she herself has had a hormonal birth control horror story. So why is it, and the symptoms, so accepted in our culture? Hormonal birth control was packaged as a tool to empower women but has ended up hurting their bodies severely.
2. Anti-Hook-Up culture/ Saving sex for marriage. They claim that modern dating is horrific largely due to the fact there has been a shift in the current generation's ideas on sex. For example, they are much more open about friends with benefits situations, no strings attached Tinder hook-ups, etc. There is an idea propagated by many so-called feminist thinkers or even popular podcasts like Call her Daddy that sleeping with whoever you want is empowering for women and that you should take pride in having a high ""body count."" This is leaving a generation of women feeling empty and depressed. They are having horrible sex, opening themselves up to heartbreak, allowing men who don't care about them to make horrible comments on their bodies, and in the worst cases putting themselves in harm's way. If a woman saves sex for marriage, they are forcing the man to fully invest (emotionally, spiritually, and finically) before any sex is had which avoids a lot of these problems.
3. Anti-Porn. They argue that porn is extremely harmful to how people view sex. Very violent porn has been completely normalized which leads to situations where women feel pressured into acts that they do not feel comfortable with and the normalization of lack of consent. They also argue how the porn industry specifically targets vulnerable girls, a lot of who are low income or even underaged.
4. Traditional family dynamics. I concede this one is mostly in a joking tone a lot of the time, but there has been a noticeable shift of women saying that they would rather be homemakers than work in a traditional job full time. It's amazing to watch women who work 40+ hrs a week come home and have to on top of that cook, clean, care for children, and more. It has become very normalized in modern culture but it's insane to think about how much work that is.

I think it's interesting that we have gotten to a place in the culture where women are beginning to reject a lot of harmful things that were fed to them. The truth of the Church has a way of always coming through even in hostile spaces such as these.",Catholicism

My head is still spinning and I am not well enough to go to my priest, but I wonder if I did the right thing.

I am into history a lot and Catholicism has such a beautiful one in so many aspects.

For some reason related to a research work, I would need to get some information on a particular topic but I'm totally unable to find anything related to it online.

Imagine, it's 1800-1850 so easy transportation means aren't super accessible. You live in a very small and isolated community of a few villagers (on the top of the mountain to keep cows for example) that is about 20km away from any city, or village big enough to have its own parish.

How would you celebrate mass on Sundays since the priest of your parish does it in the city that's too far away for you to go back and forth just for mass ? 
Can you celebrate mass in a small church you improvise, or even in nature ? 
Can you just do it by yourself without a priest, or can you wait for him to come later (church might have horses back then while super poor communities don't) ?
How would people do ?

People need to stop assuming that any 'slippery slope' argument is inherently a fallacy.,MrMcGoofy03,1626274025,"I've heard this all the time whenever you try to explain to someone that by allowing something that it would naturally follow that something else would occur. People just say ""Waa.. wait... isn't that a fallacy?!""

**Not everything is** ***inherently*** **fallacious**. A 'slippery slope' argument only becomes fallacious when the conclusions are not logical.

For example if I say ""First the government makes jaywalking illegal, now they're going to make thought crimes a thing!"" that **would** be fallacious because logically it doesn't make sense that jaywalking being illegal would lead to some dystopian world. There is nothing to even remotely suggest that a cause an effect relationship exists.

But if you say something like ""First same-sex marriage becomes legal, then polygamy will become legal"" that's **not** fallacious because it is reasonable to assume that by degrading the marital union to ""only between people that love each other"" then how does polygamy fit outside of that definition?

You could also say something like ""First same-sex marriage becomes legal, then children will have these ideologies forced onto them"". Although the link doesn't seem as clear as last time, this isn't fallacious because we have evidence to show that this cause and effect relationship exists. Look at places like California, New York, Belgium, Scandinavia. We see a trend of an initial push for tolerance and then once they garner enough support the trend changes to 'people must not only tolerate this but accept it themselves'.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the bottom line is just a friendly reminder that there's nothing inherently wrong with using a 'slippery slope' argument **if you can justify it**. Because if the outcome is logically reasonable or we have evidence to believe that a relationship between the two exists than the argument can be more than justified!",Catholicism

"Could it be blasphemy to practice prayers in Latin via repetition, not for the sake of prayer, but for practice?",Rousseau__,1626273995,"Quite some while ago, I was verbally practicing my pronunciation of the Hail Mary in Latin while listening to another pray the Rosary in Latin. However, now that I think of it, this seems to be blasphemy for the following reason:

The old Catholic Encyclopedia states that blasphemy can be direct or indirect; direct in the sense of formal intention of the act, and indirect in the sense that, ""without such intention blasphemous words are used with advertence to their import."" This seems to mean that a person can blaspheme by blaspheming via one's object as opposed to their intention. 

In my case, it would seem that though it was my intention to pronounce the words correctly, the object of my act was to vainly repeat the words of the Haily Mary. I use the word 'vainly' because the words themselves of the prayer were not being used as to their proper end, namely, to communicate with and glorify God (or to ask intercession of the Saints of course). Therefore, it seems that this act is intrinsically sinful.

Do note that I'm highly scrupulous and I might be completely wrong - who knows - but I can't see how my line of argumentation is wrong, so I would appreciate it for someone to prove me wrong. Thank you.",Catholicism
"Serious question about faith, Satan, and deals with devil.",collider_scope,1626273937,"This is going to be a rather long post about something personal and serious regarding my faith and Satan. If the post gets too many upvotes I'm deleting it.

I don't know how to begin this post. I've been a Catholic from about the time I was born. I've gone through baptism, first communion, and confirmation. Ever since I was a kid I had an intense fear of Hell and the devil and the ways he would manipulate people. I wouldn't call it an obsession but I have been obsessed with morality and where the devil is hiding my entire life like a filter I viewed the entire world in.

After I turned 17 I met a girl and we hit it off tremendously well. She was the right type for me, Catholic, nice, and funny. She was perfect for me. Time passed and eventually we found out she became pregnant. I don't know how to describe what I felt but I knew I couldn't keep the child. I was a coward and selfish and completely devoid of any capability as a man to follow through on my responsibility and in the end we aborted.  By the end of the relationship, she had already pretty much mentally checked out. I spent the next five years in basically total mental and social isolation. I didn't go out, I didn't have friends, and I couldn't study. 

Fast forward to about the beginning of 2020. I'm in school and everything is going.. ok. I'm completing my courses but basically still unable to study, I got jobs I couldn't keep, I basically had a meandering boring existence, devoid of faith and meaning. For a long time I was an atheist and basically didn't believe. I gathered a lot of bad habits, and bad ways to justify my position. So much so, that I basically forgot how to be truthful. I spent a lot of my childhood being berated  my parents and family so much, and dealt with my parents crumbling relationship, being worried about my father's faith and his trajectory in the afterlife. I was so obsessed with being whoever I wanted to be that I didn't realize I was forming a gulf between myself and family by basically being a fake person among them and someone completely different when not. I had a viscous and poisonous ego that ruined a lot of my potential friendships and social networking abilities. I had become completely isolated and lost and I kept asking myself why. In the middle of my room, pacing around, ruminating on why my life was the way that it was. In basically February of last year, right before the pandemic I think I did something terrible. My entire life I have been terrified of making deals with Satan and why anyone in their right mind would do such a thing. One night I smoked a lot weed and was sitting in my backyard contemplating over and over again the people in my life that have slighted me even slightly, convinced they were the reason I had so much issues talking to grown men because they called me gay while I was a child and formed a perception of me to my family that I had no part in and basically they were the reason everyone saw me as a weakling and gay and unsuitable for normal life. In this moment I was convinced of all of these things and I snapped entirely and went to my kitchen and said something along the lines of ""I know what I'm doing"" got a knife and when back outside and made a pentagram after I did that I drew blood and did an upside down crucifix over it and asked Satan to attack my oldest cousin in her ""fat stomach"" and a couple of other people. I know it sounds uterrely insane and I can't even bring myself to have any actual thoughts about it besides disbelief of myself. While I was doing that I felt like saying utterly idiotic stupid shit like ""I renounce my baptism, first communion, and confirmation"" pardon my language but it was so fucking stupid idiotic and childish and in my heart I felt so much fucking anger and purpose and intent. As soon as I said yes I fucking stomped out the circle and felt like crying and an intense feeling of regret. I don't know how to describe the intense feeling of confusion and distraction and dread I was so regretful and mournful and so so so angry that I let my anger reach that point after being obsessed with morality and extremely fearful of the devil my entire life. My music taste and philosophy becoming increasingly nihilistic and almost satanic but I didn't commit to any of them I simply lived my life feeling empty and being a dillitant. My feelings in that moment were a snapping realization that I am a Catholic and I will always be a Catholic. I have since loved my faith and the beauty of what connects us and the lies I have been told by the enemy to take me down this path. I want to return to the faith and help troubled youth return to their faith. 

The person I targeted was having medical problems for some time before I did this stupid unspeakable thing and a few months after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the stomach. It became malignant and she spent a year battling it only to be taken in the beginning if this month. I'm in utter disbelief and toil about how to proceed. During this stupid thing I realized what I was doing and IMMEDIATELY stomped out the circle and renounced everything I just did and prayed intensely to God about how weak and ashamed I was. I ]have confessed all of this and I fulfilled my penance (although I did not take communion as I didn't confess before the funeral church service. But I prayed the rosary and I gave a eulogy (not at her funeral viewing but at her actual burial. I am not a Satanist and I did not do this to my cousin. I have been pious my entire life and I feel an unspeakable sense of guilt and humility and humiliation. Please I want to return to God's grace I've never contemplated doing anything like this in my entire life and I'm completely lost on how to proceed. I felt what must have been 10 minutes of complete weakness and failure but I am not evil or capable of hurting anyone. I just had so much anger and lack of faith. 

           Please provide some guidance or advice and how I should proceed is such a thing even possible and did I do something I can't change. My whole life I dreaded why that was even an option for people and why the fuck would anyone do that to themselves I constantly prayed to God asking him to protect me if in the future I became so weak that I committed such an act. I knew I was weak and asked God to please protect and forgive me if ever there came a time I could not do it myself. I am so scared and lost and I know what I must do with regards to my family and friends and how to keep my horrible ego in check when it flares. I'm confused and terrified. I am not a horrible person and I have lived my life basically avoiding people in the fear that I would commit sons almost involuntarily. I've been extremely fearful to the point of intense tears about where people go where they die and at this moment I can't bring myself and comfort please help me.",Catholicism

I know the obvious answer is pornography, but let me get a little weird here: is it sinful to watch pornography at all, or to “use” it?

I, as well as many of you I’m sure, enjoy media that contains many sinful or otherwise non-righteous elements. My question is that must we abstain from viewing this material purely because of the presence of those elements?

How are Catholics called to handle toxic family members?,aspiringmom17,1626270699,"Apologies for mobile. 

I am really struggling with how to handle a family issue as a Catholic, and it is weighing heavily on me. I have confessed my anger over it and letting it get in the way of me loving God and my family for over a year, but I am still struggling and could use advice.

For some background, I grew up in a very large and close extended family on my mom's side. We lived near each other and did everything together. My cousins were my best friends, and family events took up much of my social life. As we got older, our life paths diverged, but we still see each other frequently and talk nearly everyday. My therapist said they sound more like siblings than cousins due to how entwined we are in each others' lives. 

A couple years ago, I got engaged to my fiance and we set a date at a church that's very important to the family. When we announced it at a family party, my one cousin went ballistic. She is older than me, and she and her longtime boyfriend had been talking about getting engaged. She wanted to be the first one married in that church, and she felt like I should give up my date to her and her boyfriend so I didn't take that privilege. My dad told me this was insane, so I said no. My cousin was livid and tried to turn my entire family against me, harassing my sisters and yelling at my grandma to make me stop. Her mom and sisters sided with her and joined in on the abuse. My cousins refused to be in my wedding party because they ""didn't want to get involved.""

My siblings and mom told me to give in because my actions were ""destroying the family."" I was berated in private and in public for upsetting my cousin when I ""know what she's like."" My dad was the only one who thought caving was a bad idea. I decided not to cave, and my cousin won't speak to me to this day. The other cousins have calmed down a bit but kept their distance from the situation and have told me privately that I should have just given in. 

I ended up having a tiny wedding due to covid so none of them were there anyway. My cousin will now be the first one having a family wedding in that church. I told my mom I don't want to go and was again berated for destroying the family. 

This situation was really eye-opening for me. I realized my family had solved conflicts with emotional manipulation for a long time. I also realized my mom has been the most regular target of this abuse and is afraid of the family. Everyone values family unity, so the biggest bullies get their way and everyone else backs off. There also is some genuine mental illness in the family, and many of my family members were raised thinking this is how to handle conflicts. 

I would really like to go low-to-no-conflict with my extended family after all of this. I don't like the way I was treated, I don't feel loved, and I'm honestly afraid of being close again. 

However, I feel pressure to keep loving them by having them in my life. My mom is devout and says this is what it means to be long-suffering and be a part of a family. 

What do you all think we are called to do as Catholics when we have toxic family members? How do we follow the call to love one another as God loved us while also protecting ourselves? Or is the call to make ourselves vulnerable? Is this refusing to honor my mother and father?

Acting in doubt and committing mortal sin without knowing it,inlaws-arent-outlaws,1626247077,"I've heard that in general, doing something you think *might* be mortally sinful is still mortally sinful. For the scrupulous, though, there's an exception: they unreasonably think many harmless things might be sinful, so they're encouraged to act against their doubts.

I used to be quite scrupulous, and I've been following the guideline to act against my doubts. The scrupulosity has gotten a lot better. However, I'm afraid I've gotten too lax -- being doubtful about actions that may really be mortal sins. I'm no longer sure if I can follow that guideline. At some point, it becomes sinful for me to act in doubt, right? Certainly, those with a normal or lax conscience shouldn't act in doubt. But this has created a new source of scrupulosity for me: where's the line? How much doubt does it take to make doing something sinful?

The scrupulous are told that if they are not certain that they committed a mortal sin, then they didn't. The implication seems to be that for the non-scrupulous, it is possible to commit a mortal sin without knowing it -- by acting in doubt, for instance, and thinking that doing so is OK. That's a scary thought, but from what I've read online, that seems to be the Church's teaching -- acting with a doubtful conscience is sinful.

People's cruelty is stunning.,HardBipartisanTruths,1626245637,"My parents were non-practicing Catholic. I never really asked about it and they never said much about it. However, their morality was as close to Catholic morality as most people can get. I know this because I haven't hit a rule or Church policy yet that I disagree with across the whole spectrum, whether it's the environment, criminal justice, helping others, marriage, or what have you. Even things which cross the political spectrum, I increasingly find they raised me with the morality of the Church.

I went through an edgy militant atheist phase when I was like 15-17, so I've said a few things I cringe at now, but the things other people are saying now are insanely evil and insanely normalized.

Do you know how normal and accepted it is among young people to just casually say that you look forward to when the older generation dies so that social values change? I saw people today fantasizing about things (mostly regarding gay sex) they could tell their grandfather on his deathbed when he was ""too weak to change the will."" I've heard others say that their relatives' deaths can't come fast enough for the ""change"" it will bring.

This isn't normal. Most of these elderly people, even if they have beliefs you hate, they've never actually *done* anything to hurt others. Their insults are just words, and hoping someone dies for that is evil. 

#Lovewins, except how is it love to feel a sense of glee from hurting and tormenting others? 

Something is horribly sick and wrong with society that they don't see the inherent contradiction between identifying with love and then fantasizing about who they can torment and watch die.

I'm familiar with the ""paradox of intolerance."" That prescribes action, not emotion. It states that it's immoral to tolerate intolerance because it leads to greater intolerance. The thing is, tolerant legal systems do not require you to wish death or torture on dissenters. It is fully possible to believe in gay rights and legally oppose what you see as intolerance, and *not* fantasize about seeing people suffer.  The twisted fantasies people on the side of #Love have are their own internal sickness, not part of any civil rights movement.

The Catholic church gets the concept of believing something is wrong, and trying to enact change, but not hating people or mistreating them in the mean time.

The other side just seemingly does not get that. Fantasizing about death is part of the fun.",Catholicism

I mostly understand that since children have underdeveloped faculties of reason and discernment, they are unable to have the sufficient movement of the will and understanding in order to personally commit actual sin.

However, does that also mean that baptized children are unable to commit meritorious acts?

Are the prayers of children for the dead satisfactory, or do they benefit the Holy Souls by impetration alone?



Put differently... While children may and do at times commit what would otherwise be evil acts, such acts are not reckoned as moral evils because the object (and intention?) of the action pertains to reason. Since the morality of a human act depends upon object, intention, and circumstance [CCC 1750], and a morally good act requires all three to be good [CCC 1755], does that mean children cannot commit morally good actions, nor morally evil actions? All pre-age-of-reason acts are neutral? Is this the right understanding?",Catholicism
Is being rich a sin?,Catholic_Guy18,1626227600,"I got banned from r/Catholic_Solidarity because I said it was not a sin to be rich. I do not think it is a sin because 1. Being rich is relative and 2. There will always be differences in occupation and spending/saving habits. 

I think when talking about money and sin we should be talking about meeting charitable obligatIons and making sure the material and live of money does not compromise those values. 

When talking about the ultra wealthy, I think the problem is not that Billionaires are rich, but that the system which incentivizes ownership in companies and being beholden to investors with no direct contributions to the company.

I understand that if a man looks on a woman with lust then he has already committed adultery in his heart. So obviously looking lustfully at kids, including child abuse materials, and clearly actual assault are all grave sins. But what about intrusive, unwanted thoughts? Are those thoughts sins?

"OTD 451 Years ago, Pope St. Pius V issued the Apostolic Constitution Quo Primum, establishing the Liturgy used in Rome as the standard throughout the Church, this was known afterwards as the Tridentine Mass. Only Masses 200 years old or older could continue to be said in the Latin Church.",Jattack33,1626221955,"From the very first, upon Our elevation to the chief Apostleship, We gladly turned our mind and energies and directed all our thoughts to those matters which concerned the preservation of a pure liturgy, and We strove with God's help, by every means in our power, to accomplish this purpose. For, besides other decrees of the sacred Council of Trent, there were stipulations for Us to revise and re-edit the sacred books: the Catechism, the Missal and the Breviary. With the Catechism published for the instruction of the faithful, by God's help, and the Breviary thoroughly revised for the worthy praise of God, in order that the Missal and Breviary may be in perfect harmony, as fitting and proper - for its most becoming that there be in the Church only one appropriate manner of reciting the Psalms and only one rite for the celebration of Mass - We deemed it necessary to give our immediate attention to what still remained to be done, viz, the re-editing of the Missal as soon as possible.

Hence, We decided to entrust this work to learned men of our selection. They very carefully collated all their work with the ancient codices in Our Vatican Library and with reliable, preserved or emended codices from elsewhere. Besides this, these men consulted the works of ancient and approved authors concerning the same sacred rites; and thus they have restored the Missal itself to the original form and rite of the holy Fathers. When this work has been gone over numerous times and further emended, after serious study and reflection, We commanded that the finished product be printed and published as soon as possible, so that all might enjoy the fruits of this labor; and thus, priests would know which prayers to use and which rites and ceremonies they were required to observe from now on in the celebration of Masses.

Let all everywhere adopt and observe what has been handed down by the Holy Roman Church, the Mother and Teacher of the other churches, and let Masses not be sung or read according to any other formula than that of this Missal published by Us. This ordinance applies henceforth, now, and forever, throughout all the provinces of the Christian world, to all patriarchs, cathedral churches, collegiate and parish churches, be they secular or religious, both of men and of women - even of military orders - and of churches or chapels without a specific congregation in which conventual Masses are sung aloud in choir or read privately in accord with the rites and customs of the Roman Church. This Missal is to be used by all churches, even by those which in their authorization are made exempt, whether by Apostolic indult, custom, or privilege, or even if by oath or official confirmation of the Holy See, or have their rights and faculties guaranteed to them by any other manner whatsoever.

This new rite alone is to be used unless approval of the practice of saying Mass differently was given at the very time of the institution and confirmation of the church by Apostolic See at least 200 years ago, or unless there has prevailed a custom of a similar kind which has been continuously followed for a period of not less than 200 years, in which most cases We in no wise rescind their above-mentioned prerogative or custom. However, if this Missal, which we have seen fit to publish, be more agreeable to these latter, We grant them permission to celebrate Mass according to its rite, provided they have the consent of their bishop or prelate or of their whole Chapter, everything else to the contrary notwithstanding.

All other of the churches referred to above, however, are hereby denied the use of other missals, which are to be discontinued entirely and absolutely; whereas, by this present Constitution, which will be valid henceforth, now, and forever, We order and enjoin that nothing must be added to Our recently published Missal, nothing omitted from it, nor anything whatsoever be changed within it under the penalty of Our displeasure.

We specifically command each and every patriarch, administrator, and all other persons or whatever ecclesiastical dignity they may be, be they even cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, or possessed of any other rank or pre-eminence, and We order them in virtue of holy obedience to chant or to read the Mass according to the rite and manner and norm herewith laid down by Us and, hereafter, to discontinue and completely discard all other rubrics and rites of other missals, however ancient, which they have customarily followed; and they must not in celebrating Mass presume to introduce any ceremonies or recite any prayers other than those contained in this Missal.

Furthermore, by these presents \[this law\], in virtue of Our Apostolic authority, We grant and concede in perpetuity that, for the chanting or reading of the Mass in any church whatsoever, this Missal is hereafter to be followed absolutely, without any scruple of conscience or fear of incurring any penalty, judgment, or censure, and may freely and lawfully be used. Nor are superiors, administrators, canons, chaplains, and other secular priests, or religious, of whatever title designated, obliged to celebrate the Mass otherwise than as enjoined by Us. We likewise declare and ordain that no one whosoever is forced or coerced to alter this Missal, and that this present document cannot be revoked or modified, but remain always valid and retain its full force - notwithstanding the previous constitutions and decrees of the Holy See, as well as any general or special constitutions or edicts of provincial or synodal councils, and notwithstanding the practice and custom of the aforesaid churches, established by long and immemorial prescription - except, however, if more than two hundred years' standing.

It is Our will, therefore, and by the same authority, We decree that, after We publish this constitution and the edition of the Missal, the priests of the Roman Curia are, after thirty days, obliged to chant or read the Mass according to it; all others south of the Alps, after three months; and those beyond the Alps either within six months or whenever the Missal is available for sale. Wherefore, in order that the Missal be preserved incorrupt throughout the whole world and kept free of flaws and errors, the penalty for non-observance for printers, whether mediately or immediately subject to Our dominion, and that of the Holy Roman Church, will be the forfeiting of their books and a fine of one hundred gold ducats, payable ipso facto to the Apostolic Treasury. Further, as for those located in other parts of the world, the penalty is excommunication latae sententiae, and such other penalties as may in Our judgment be imposed; and We decree by this law that they must not dare or presume either to print or to publish or to sell, or in any way to accept books of this nature without Our approval and consent, or without the express consent of the Apostolic Commissaries of those places, who will be appointed by Us. Said printer must receive a standard Missal and agree faithfully with it and in no wise vary from the Roman Missal of the large type (secundum magnum impressionem).

Accordingly, since it would be difficult for this present pronouncement to be sent to all parts of the Christian world and simultaneously come to light everywhere, We direct that it be, as usual, posted and published at the doors of the Basilica of the Prince of the Apostles, also at the Apostolic Chancery, and on the street at Campo Flora; furthermore, We direct that printed copies of this same edict signed by a notary public and made official by an ecclesiastical dignitary possess the same indubitable validity everywhere and in every nation, as if Our manuscript were shown there. Therefore, no one whosoever is permitted to alter this notice of Our permission, statute, ordinance, command, precept, grant, indult, declaration, will, decree, and prohibition. Should know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul.

John the Baptist on the Chosen.,DependentShirt8089,1626219867,"I have been watching the Chosen and I was wondering what people think of their presentation of John the Baptist? I think this character and Our Holy Mother Mary are WAY out of line with the gospel truths.

Specifically John the Baptist is portrayed as a crazy man.  Which he kinda is in the Gospels, but he unequivocally knew who Christ was and his mission.  In the show he seems to question Christ too much and not have a grasp of his place.  John the Baptist was a convicted man.  In the show he says something along the lines of, “I will go to Herod and question him, and my followers will love it”.  That doesn’t sound like the greatest singularly man born of women to me.

I know it’s a show, but it’s great and I’m wondering what Catholics are thinking about it.  I think as it goes on we will like it less, as they gloss over John 6 and the Last Super.  I think Dallas Jenkins is a holy man with his heart in the correct place.  May Christ lead him to the fulfillment.  We need to pray for him.

Bad handling of disability related issues at parish...how to address this?,getlostandfound,1626219716,"I'm sorry if this post turns emotional, but I'm deeply hurt by what happened today at my parish.

My son was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago.   As is typical for people with ADHD, when he is focusing on some task or doing something he often doesn't process someone talking to him unless one gets close to his face and makes eye contact with him.   This happens at home, at school, etc.   At school his teachers have been more or less very good about accomodating his needs (although the Catholic school it is muich less accomodating than public school) and he has been leading a successful childhood.

We signed him up for a church-run summer camp at our parish.  Over the last few days the sister running his group has been complaining that he doesn't listen to her.  We asked him what it is about, and he has no recollection of anything specific.   

Today when she again complained about him not listening, we asked him in front of her to see if he was aware of a specific event.  Again he had no recollection.  So we asked her to tell us and him specifically what transpired.  She said he wasn't stopping his work when she told him to, or when he was at recess he was not coming in when she was shouting for all of them to stop playing.   During both, because he was actively involved in doing other things (playing or working on another assigned task), he didn't even realize she was talking to him.

When we mentioned to the sister that he has ADHD and he's not actively trying to be disobedient, she lectured him ""If you want to learn about Jesus you have to be good.""  I'm sorry, what?  He's not an angel, but this is a kid who prays the rosary every day of his own accord.  He has an actual disability.  Just as it would not be ok to chastise a blind person who doesn't make eye contact, or a deaf person who doesn't respond to your commands, it is not ok to chastise a kid with ADHD for not realizing you are speaking to him.   Why are so many Catholic institutions so bad at understanding/supporting mental illness and immediately associating it with ill will (this is based on several experiences between public and Catholic institutions)?  I don't want to pull him out of the camp, but I worry he will keep getting chastised for something that is out of his control.  How would you suggest we address this?",Catholicism

And yet whenever I see questions about the end times, people seem to shy away from answering questions and stress that we all meet inevitable ends and to not focus on on the end days but instead live a life of grace always being prepared

Technically correct but wouldn’t directing focus away from it technically be heretical since the end times generation needs to follow scripture and dogma? I guess my main thing is that many of us follow the authority structure of the church and I’m only speaking for myself - I know that priests are fallible but I do follow their teachings and guidance and take it to heart.

Is my fetish a sin?,RedditWillBURN,1626203581,"I'm sorry for asking, I'm kinda embarassed myself to be honest. But I really want to know  this answer (since I couldn't find it).

So, I am 16 years old and I was baptized 2 years ago. Before I converted to catholicism and recognized masturbation as a sin, I was doing it a lot.  I still struggle to leave this sin to this very day, however, I realized that I have the vocation to be a husband and a father. So, by the graces and the love of God, and because I want, for his glory, to be a good boyfriend, a good husband and a good father, I can see that God is distancing me from that sin.

However, I do have lots of fantasies and fetishes. And I know this is part of healthy sexuality unless it offends God in any way. So, I'd like to ask, is having a fetish for (please don't get me wrong here, read until the final word) anime nuns clothing a sin? I mean, it's way more revealing than real ones, and I think it has lots of more sexualized and very different from real ones. I don't consider it wrong because to me it is just so far from the real ones that I wouldn't even say it belongs to any sort of nun.

A Catholic Theory on Faith-based Natural Selection in the Coming Decades,Mr-Ziul,1626198740,"&gt; *“We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, his power, and the wonders he has done.”*   
&gt;  
&gt;Psalms 78:4

**Disclaimers:** 

* Trends discussed here are not supported by official numeric and data values.
* The lens, and thereby any possible bias that might be incorporated into this post, through which this article is being written is that of a North American teen Catholic.
* This post does not aim to attack or incite harassment towards the communities and ideologies mentioned. 
* I am not academically accredited in theology, philosophy, ethics, or Catholic studies.

**Background:**

During the past months of my online presence, I started to notice a pattern of sorts in relation to the demographics of Reddit and Tiktok. Through rabbit-hole exploration, I ended up discovering the existence of r/antinatalism and r/antiwork while simultaneously already being aware of r/prochoice and r/atheism. I may be typing the subreddit name, but all of it implies the existence of their respective philosophies in the real world.

**Now here’s the deal to think upon:**

1. The next generation in the normal timescale of society is dependent upon Gen X, Y, and Z (due to natural reproductive capabilities).
2. Gen X, Y, and Z seem to have increasing numbers (compared to past centuries) of atheism.
3. If the pattern follows through, and those Xs, Ys, and Zs are atheists attached to pro-choice, antiwork, and antinatalist ideas, then it can be expected that fewer children will be raisedw by them (assuming the few numbers they will have at all) and so those same ideas will not be passed down to the next generation. 
4. What results is a surplus of Catholics who value family (some even with plans for 10-member households!), life, and hard work, and are devoted to raising their children with God and God-centered values, viewpoints, ideas, and philosophies.

**Counterpoints:**

* This will not be exclusive to Catholics, since practically all current dominant religions value family and child-bearing. Thus, Catholicism will have children to rise as Catholics, but so does Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, etc.
* A child raised within a certain religion does not guarantee it will continue to practice and withhold it.
* Not all atheists are antinatalists, not all atheists are pro-choice; and so on and so forth with the discussed philosophies.
* A sort of ‘survivorship bias’ applies here, since the ‘sample size’ I used to write this is based on my own online presence and experience. The outside world is much more complex.

**Discussion:** I invite you to comment in order to continue the conversation. Point out your thoughts, opinions, any logical fallacy I might have fallen into, logistical errors, or any other decent talking point. Just be civil and respect the Catholic faith.",Catholicism

"Myth Busting: Protestant Churches, and thus their methods, are more effective at retaining young people.",Gerrigen,1626194821,"When people say this it tends to primarily be in reference to the MEGA CHURCH down the street or across town that has a subpar rock concert every week that is brimming with High Schoolers. Catholics see this and naturally juxtapose it with the image of their 10-15 high-schoolers that stick around after they get drivers licenses. 


The feeling of sadness is understandable, but it is unfounded. As someone who once was in ministry at a mega church allow me to explain this phenomenom.

First you cannot think of a large denominational church in the same way you think of another parish in your deanery. Whereas a disparate parish is essentially an extension of the same body a MEGA CHURCH is more of a parasite devouring an already sick host. 


Now some of you will read that line and accuse me of hyperbole, but trust me when I say I am being completely literal. There are somewhere around a handful of functional denominations (I love the 30k meme too, but for the purposes of this discussion I will only be referencing those with a sizeable following) and that handful 50 years ago would have had 5 or so Churches a piece across a region. Now they are down to one or two shrinking congregations as they were hit with the same post modernist decline that Catholics were and then received a knockout blow from the new players in town. 

Non-denominational Mega Churches.

They are designed specifically to consume the other Churches in a region, feasting off the division not only among the denominations themselves but also within the individual congregations. 

Calvinism vs Armenianism? Who cares, it isn't Salvation essential. Pre-tribulation or Amillennial? Dude eschatology is divisive. Eternal Security? Predestination? Reality of Hell? Original Sin? Total Depravity? Women Ministers? LGBT issues? Guys, salvation only, all of those are just personal conviction amigo.


The strategy is simple and insidious. Throw out everything that less than 80% of protestants agree on, and feast on the disenfranchised. Each of those issues were previously fought over tooth and nail, now Pentecostals and the SBC are the last real holdouts to the new Soteriology peddled by the Non-Denoms. 

So when you see 300 youth with arms raised engaging in an emotional fervor you cannot compare it to your youth group. instead you have to compare it to all the youth in your deanery, and then I think you will find a more favorable image. 

Second, they are loosing youth just as fast, if not faster, than we are. They just loose them a little later. 

We loose them in two main spots: 16 and 19. When they get their licenses or leave for college.

Mega Churches loose in two phases as well: 19 and 22. When they leave their programming bubbles of High School Ministry and College ministry. 

It is a consequence of the no substance approach. The Philosophy of Jesus, as I like to call it. Without the continual stream of ""Flash!!"" they simply fade away. 

Whereas with us, those 10-15 juniors and seniors at your parish are incredibly likely to continue in the faith, and those we loose at college are more likely to come back at marriage than their peers. Why?

Substance. True sacramental engagement with 2000 years of intellectual tradition. There is a reality. 


Obviously we need to make improvements, massive groundbreaking improvements, but please don't think for a second that the path forward is protestant-izing the Church. They put the bar on the ground and thus see a boom of attendance. 

As someone who was a minister there 9 out of ten baptisms were just Christians from another denomination or poorly catechized Catholics. 


Take my word for what it's worth (nothing), in the next 20 years we will see these massive temples to mammon  shutting their doors left and right. Just like what is currently happening to the Evangelicals, what happened to the Methodists and Lutherans, and what happened to the Episcopals and Anglicans.",Catholicism
"Honest question: I am misreading this passage from St. Athanasius' ""Against the Heathen""? Or does it not really serve its purpose of invalidating polytheism?",Malivamar,1626194079,"This is the passage in question:

\&gt; 

&gt;For we must not think there is more than one ruler and maker of Creation: but it belongs to correct and true religion to believe that its Artificer is one, while Creation herself clearly points to this. For the fact that there is one Universe only and not more is a conclusive proof that its Maker is one. For if there were a plurality of gods, there would necessarily be also more universes than one. For neither were it reasonable for more than one God to make a single universe, nor for the one universe to be made by more than one, because of the absurdities which would result from this.  
&gt;  
&gt;Firstly, if the one universe were made by a plurality of gods, that would mean weakness on the part of those who made it, because many contributed to a single result; which would be a strong proof of the imperfect creative skill of each. For if one were sufficient, the many would not supplement each other's deficiency. But to say that there is any deficiency in God is not only impious, but even beyond all sacrilege. For even among men one would not call a workman perfect if he were unable to finish his work, a single piece, by himself and without the aid of several others.  
&gt;  
&gt;But if, although each one was able to accomplish the whole, yet all worked at it in order to claim a share in the result, we have the laughable conclusion that each worked for reputation, lest he should be suspected of inability. But, once more, it is most grotesque to ascribe vainglory to gods.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, if each one were sufficient for the creation of the whole, what need of more than one, one being self-sufficient for the universe? Moreover it would be evidently impious and grotesque, to make the thing created one, while the creators were many and different, it being a maxim of science that what is one and complete is higher than things that are diverse.  
&gt;  
&gt;And this you must know, that if the universe had been made by a plurality of gods, its movements would be diverse and inconsistent. For having regard to each one of its makers, its movements would be correspondingly different. But such difference again, as was said before, would involve disarray and general disorder; for not even a ship will sail aright if she be steered by many, unless one pilot hold the tiller , nor will a lyre struck by many produce a tuneful sound, unless there be one artist who strikes it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Creation, then, being one, and the Universe one, and its order one, we must perceive that its King and Artificer also is one. For this is why the Artificer Himself made the whole universe one, lest by the coexistence of more than one a plurality of makers should be supposed; but that as the work is one, its Maker also may be believed to be One. Nor does it follow from the unity of the Maker that the Universe must be one, for God might have made others as well. But because the Universe that has been made is one, it is necessary to believe that its Maker also is one.

&amp;#x200B;

Now when he says ""And this you must know, that if the universe had been made by a plurality of gods, its movements would be diverse and inconsistent. ""

 What exactly about a plurality of creators makes it so that it would be inconsistent? If two watch makers work on two different watches does that mean that the watches will work differently to each other? And if the two watchmakers work on the same watch, would it work inconsistently? Why? Surely they, working towards the same ""product"" would keep its function internally consistent, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also in paragraph 1 he says: ""For the fact that there is one Universe only and not more is a conclusive proof that its Maker is one. For if there were a plurality of gods, there would necessarily be also more universes than one. For neither were it reasonable for more than one God to make a single universe, nor for the one universe to be made by more than one, because of the absurdities which would result from this.""

Maybe I'm just not getting it but whats inherently unreasonable about a single, all powerful God, making more than one universe? And likewise whats unreasonable about several gods making a single or even multiple universes? What are the absurdities here that he mentions? And if he points them out specifically elsewhere in his book, then could someone please quote them or write them yourself if you know what he means?

Not looking to cause trouble with this point, nor to change anyone else's mind, I'm just looking for answers on a topic I've been personally struggling with. All info is appreciated, thanks in advanced.",Catholicism
"Why aren't cockroaches generally associated with gluttony? If anything their behavior seems more inline with the Deadly Sin than frogs, flies, and even pigs are!",UralBolivar,1626193732,"Just saw a video where a female cockroach eats her baby child after its molted out of its shell and males are missing pieces of her wings because all the males eat each others wings.  Despite the fact they are locked up in a special container for scientific studies and thus have unlimited food and water in the study box.

n addition I also learned cockroaches eat each others legs on a google search and not even when the are out of food but simply because they like the flavor. If it gets even more disgusting, if you injure a roach and cause parts of its guts to fall out, there's a good chance it will eat out the freshly ripped parts  on the floor on the instant.


Heck the quickest way to get rid of a roach infestation  is to la poison around because the roach hat eats it will die in the main nest and then immediately other cockroaches  around will eat the fresh corpse and the get poisoned and die and more roaches will ea it and die and the cycle repeats until practically he whole colony dies!


So I'm very curious why cockroaches aren't associated with the deadly sin of gluttony? Esp since most of the time flies won't eat its dead corpses, frogs  won't do so unless as last resort, and even pigs  will mourn if it eats its recently dead friend (and will only do so when there is no other food source).


Where as roaches have no qualms about ambushing its best friend its been living with for months and eating its wings even though other food is around all simply because they feel in the mood for something different!

And we are not counting how roaches ea everything from wood to cardboard boxes and rotting food even fresh feces!


So why aren't cockroaches seen as one of the symbols of gluttony in traditional theology? I mean none of the mythological and fictional literature ever uses roaches as punishment where as frogs in our mouth is the punishment for gluttony in The Divine Comedy as an example. Nevermind writings by religious experts who often point out examples from the bible for flies and theologians pointing out demonology texts and pigs and so on!

If anything cockroaches should be seen as **THE ANIMAL**  that is the symbol of gluttony considering they have no remorse eating their children simply because they tire of the available food and have an urge to eat something new!!!!!",Catholicism

But I just thought it would be good to give these quotes out of a sense of Ecumenical Fraternity to help people look at these things from a proper context and perspective. Here are quotes from a random selection on these topics. 

""It is also blasphemous to make use of God's name to cover up criminal practises, to reduce peoples to servitude, to torture persons or put them to death. The misuse of God's name to commit crime can provoke others to repudiate religion. Blasphemy is contrary to the respect due to God and his holy name. IT is in itself a grave sin""\_Catechism of the Catholic Church(prg 2148)

""Rape is the forcible violation of the sexual intimacy of another person. It does injury to justice and charity. Rape deeply wounds the respect, freedom and physical and moral integrity to which every person has a right. It causes grave damage that can mark the victim for life. It is always an intrinsically evil act. Graver still is the rape of children committed by parents or those responsible for the education of children entrusted to them""\_Catechism of the Catholic Church(prg 2356)

""Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of those who cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized. It prompted our Lord to utter this curse: 'Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea'. Scandal is grave when given by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others. Jesus reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this account: he likens them to wolves in sheeps clothing""\_Catechism of the Catholic Church(prg 2285)

""Nevertheless, though much has thus been done for indigenous peoples, there is much more that still remains to be done. And, indeed, when we consider the crimes and outrages still committed against them, our heart is filled with horror, and we are moved to great compassion....... For what can be so cruel and so barbarous as to scourge \[human beings\] and brand them with hot iron, often for most trivial causes, often for a mere lust of cruelty; or, having suddenly overthrown them, to slay hundreds or thousands in one unceasing massacre; or to waste villages and districts and slaughter the inhabitants, so that some tribes, as we understand, have become extinct in these last few years?""\_Pope Pius X(Lacrimabili Statu)

"" we, mindful of the example of our aforesaid predecessor, condemn and declare guilty of grave crime whosoever, as he says, ""shall dare or presume to reduce the said \[indigenous people\] to slavery, to sell them, to buy them, to exchange or give them, to separate them from their wives and children, to deprive them of goods and chattels, to transport or send them to other places, or in any way whatsoever to rob them of freedom and hold them in slavery; or to give counsel, help, favor, and work on any pretext of color to them that do these things, or to preach or teach that it is lawful, or to co-operate therewith in any way whatever.""\_Pope Pius X(Lacrimabili Statu)

""“Whenever the truth has been suppressed by governments and their agencies or even by Christian communities, the wrongs done to the indigenous peoples need to be honestly acknowledged….The past cannot be undone, but honest recognition of past injustices can lead to measures and attitudes which will help to rectify the damaging effects for both the indigenous community and the wider society. The Church expresses deep regret and asks forgiveness where her children have been or still are party to these wrongs. Aware of the shameful injustices done to indigenous peoples....., the Synod Fathers apologized unreservedly for the part played in these by members of the Church, especially where children were forcibly separated from their families""\_Pope John Paul II(Ecclesia Oceania).

""Indigenous peoples....are not opposed to progress, yet theirs is a different notion of progress, often more humanistic than the modern culture.....Theirs is not a culture meant to benefit the powerful, those driven to create for themselves a kind of earthly paradise. Intolerance and lack of respect for indigenous popular cultures is a form of violence grounded in a cold and judgement way of viewing them""\_Pope Francis(Fratelli Tutti)

""It is true that ""the scourge of sexual abuse of minors is, and historically has been, a widespread phenomenon in all cultures and societies', especially within families and in various institutions; its extent has become known primarily thanks to changes in public opinion. Even so, this problem, while it is universal and 'gravely affects our society as a whole....is in no way less monstrous when it takes place within the Church'. Indeed, 'in people's justified anger, the Church sees the reflection of the wrath of God, betrayed and insulted""\_Pope Francis(Christus Vivit) 

""Abuse exists in various forms: the abuse of power, the abuse of conscience, sexual and financial abuse. Clearly the ways of exercising authority that make all this possible have to be eradicated and the irresponsibility and lack of transparency with which so many cases have been handled have to be challenged. The desire to dominate, lack of dialogue and transparency, forms of double life, spiritual emptiness, as well as psychological weaknesses, are all terrain on which corruption thrives""\_Pope Francis(Christus Vivit) 

""“If one member suffers, all suffer together with it” (*1 Cor* 12:26). These words of Saint Paul forcefully echo in my heart as I acknowledge once more the suffering endured by many minors due to sexual abuse, the abuse of power and the abuse of conscience perpetrated by a significant number of clerics and consecrated persons. Crimes that inflict deep wounds of pain and powerlessness, primarily among the victims, but also in their family members and in the larger community of believers and nonbelievers alike. Looking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient. Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated. The pain of the victims and their families is also our pain, and so it is urgent that we once more reaffirm our commitment to ensure the protection of minors and of vulnerable adults.""\_Pope Francis(Letter to the People of God, 2018) 

""Even though it can be said that most of these cases belong to the past, nonetheless as time goes on we have come to know the pain of many of the victims. We have realized that these wounds never disappear and that they require us forcefully to condemn these atrocities and join forces in uprooting this culture of death; these wounds never go away. The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced. But their outcry was more powerful than all the measures meant to silence it, or sought even to resolve it by decisions that increased its gravity by falling into complicity. The Lord heard that cry and once again showed us on which side he stands. Mary’s song is not mistaken and continues quietly to echo throughout history. For the Lord remembers the promise he made to our fathers: “he has scattered the proud in their conceit; he has cast down the mighty from their thrones and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty” (*Lk* 1:51-53). We feel shame when we realize that our style of life has denied, and continues to deny, the words we recite.""\_Pope Francis(Letter to the People of God, 2018)",Catholicism

I don't know if I'm losing faith or if I even had one,Altruistic-Ad2956,1626162519,"long text ahead, tldr below

I've always ignored this doubt but today there's this two people who came in to our house to share words from the bible so I thought I'll talk about it now. 

Before they started, my mom called my younger brother to sit down and listen with her, telling those visitors that he always reads the bible back then but not anymore bc he now spends too much time playing mobile games. After the discussion my mom was convincing my brother that it's the demon. That the demon was preventing him from reading the bible and everything. That sounded so wrong to me. I was wearing earphones the whole time so they won't talk to me or include me but I heard everything. I heard my mom ask the visitors if they got vaccinated and I didn't hear their answer that much, but instead I heard them say ""Did you know that God is always a step ahead? Before this pandemic happen, he already did this and that."" Seems to me like my mom and our relatives not wanting to be vaccinated has something to do with their belief. I'm convinced they believe that God can just end this pandemic because ""He got us"" then they won't ever get vaccinated. 

It's understandable to not want if it's because they're worried about their health but it's obviously not the case. They also asked my mom if she believes in hell and my mom said no, then they said something like ""Well, it exists as said in the bible"" My brother to my mom after they left was like ""You don't believe in hell?"" Like he's very sure it's real, probably one of the things he learned back then. 

Now let's talk about me. I was raised in a religious household and country in general. I always went to the church with my mom, prayed every night (this I always do until now), thank God for small things and apologize if I did something wrong, etc. My mom is also very emotional about things so I also became one and it was easy for her to convince me. 

Only in the middle of this pandemic, I kind of became more, idk, rational? I don't exactly know when, but I just started watching yt videos, ted talks, saw people mocking religion on social media, then I started watching western shows and realized, I really am so emotional and empathetic and it was annoying. I realized it's also my whole country that made me, our tv shows are more on dramas, emotional stuff. And at this point I don't know if I ever believed in God or it was just fear the whole time. If I'm being honest with myself, I only ""still"" pray because I'm afraid that something bad happen to me if I don't, also got me thinking, if God exists and knows everything, He must know that I'm only lying to myself. 

I want to believe that there is no higher or spiritual God out there, but then there's a lot of things in this world that are logically hard to explain. I think this is why I still pray. I mean, it makes me feel good that I have someone to talk to, give thanks, apologize to, and everything, but sometimes I just know I don't mean it and just recite the same stuff every night. Should I do something about this? Leave the religion and everything or just stay this way?

TLDR : I was raised in a religious household and country but I'm started to think I was just forced to believe what they believe because if I'm being honest to myself, religion, the bible, and everything, doesn't/ make sense or never made sense to me. I still pray every night because of the fear of something bad happening to me. I just hate that it affects people esp my family's mindset and their behavior sometimes and assume some patterns in their lives are related to their belief.",Catholicism

I was wondering if any catholic (more theological well read than I) has read this book. It is not a catholic book, the author describes it as a “scientific Christianity” text, and it has to do with interesting the sermon on the Mount thru this a different viewpoint that I am used to. 

I came across this book through Alcoholic Anonymous, where the big book (guide to the program) pulls heavily from it. 

I have some questions regarding the catholic views on certain items in the text, so I was hoping if a priest was familiar with either the book, the author, or the scientific Christianity (which I think is just his name for the ‘new age’ religious phenomenon at the start of the 20th century), I would appreciate some guidance.

Apparently the family member believes that back then ( as now) a lot of Catholic clergy and bishops were clandestinely gay or having affairs and because they were doing things that were wrong felt compelled to protect or look the other way regarding priests who did really wrong things.

This family member gave an example of an old friend who went to the seminary circa 1980. Apparently everyone at the seminary ( or nearly ) was gay with each other on the sly. The friend couldn’t take the dishonesty of what he saw and decided to leave.

Basically this family member said so few clergy back then actually lived a celibate life and the secrecy/ pretense of it helped permit the pedophile scandal to fester.

[Politics Monday] Is it wrong to disagree with “the Doctrine of Double Effect” when discussing ectopic pregnancy?,Dats_Russia,1626123332,"Disclaimer: I am NOT supporting abortion. Abortion is WRONG full stop. 

Definitions:

*ectopic pregnancy:* A pregnancy in which the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus. The fertilized egg can't survive outside the uterus. If left to grow, it may damage nearby organs and cause life-threatening loss of blood.

*Fallopian tube:* also known as uterine tubes, salpinges (singular salpinx), or oviducts, are tubes that stretch from the uterus to the ovaries, and are part of the female reproductive system. A fertilized egg passes through the Fallopian tubes from the ovaries of female mammals to the uterus.

*Methotrexate:* is a chemotherapy agent and immune-system suppressant. It is used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, and ectopic pregnancy and for medical abortions. It does NOT affect future fertility 


I don’t understand how the double effect preserves life when removal of women’s Fallopian tube can leave them infertile. Why is preventative proactive measures seen as equivalent to abortion? Like I have read the theology on the double effect and I get it but I don’t agree and I don’t understand why this policy can’t be changed and why it has to be like this. 

Like the science is clear, ectopic pregnancy is 100% fatal to fetuses and potentially life threatening to women. Current church policy has the side effect of leaving women potentially infertile because it requires removal of the Fallopian tube. Methotrexate and incision of the Fallopian tube are the current standards of care for ectopic pregnancies, which are life-threatening.",Catholicism

[Politics Monday] Critical Race Theory and Catholicism,personAAA,1626119052,"What the hell is Critical Race Theory (CRT)?

'“a way of looking at law’s role platforming, facilitating, producing,  and even insulating racial inequality in our country,” \[sic\] law  professor Kimberlé Crenshaw,""'

Ibram X. Kendi: [https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/opponents-critical-race-theory-are-arguing-themselves/619391/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/opponents-critical-race-theory-are-arguing-themselves/619391/)

&gt;In *How to Be an Antiracist*, I define racial equity as a state  “when two or more racial groups are standing on a relatively equal  footing.” I proposed that an example of racial equity would be “if there  were relatively equitable percentages” of racial groups “living in  owner-occupied homes in the forties, seventies, or, better, nineties.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Those who wish to conserve racial inequity want us to focus on  intent—which is hard to prove—rather than the outcome of inequity, which  is rather easy to prove.

Kendi opens his article stating critics of CRT cannot define it properly. Therefore, I took his quote and a few lines to expand on his viewpoint from the linked article.

Kendi spends a fair amount of time blasting away at Ross Douthat. The comparison between Kendi and Rush Limbaugh got to Kendi.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/03/opinion/antiracist-education-history.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/03/opinion/antiracist-education-history.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage)

Douthat's previous article on CRT. I think he does a find job laying out the politics of the debate around CRT. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/26/opinion/critical-race-theory-schools-history.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/26/opinion/critical-race-theory-schools-history.html)

&gt;The debate over this newspaper’s 1619 Project is a good example. The project became a locus for backlash because it did several things at once, offering a general (and widely praised) expansion of historical knowledge about slavery and race, but also elevating specific interpretations — in particular, the so-called new history of capitalism, a cotton-centric interpretation of American prosperity — that imply a deeper condemnation of this country.  
&gt;  
&gt;The backlash to 1619 and similar efforts has convinced progressives that the right is desperately clinging to myths of American innocence. But conservatives often see themselves as objecting to the most radical parts of progressive revisionism, not the entire project.

So, the debate in short around CRT with teaching history is the question of is America a fundamentally good nation or not. However, the debate does not end there. The question of using law and power to affect or correct imbalances remains.

Remember, Kendi likes the definition involving law. I do not think it is a stretch to say he would like to use the force of law to correct inequality in society. The most pressing gaps in society to him are the racial ones.

The boarder ideology of using law to correct inequality quickly becomes dangerous. Inequalities are differences between groups. Applying this ideology to correct differences between religious groups makes me want to scream.

Read this: [https://hedgehogreview.com/web-features/thr/posts/the-problem-with-western-religions-on-campus](https://hedgehogreview.com/web-features/thr/posts/the-problem-with-western-religions-on-campus)

&gt;I knew I had to quit my job in the Chaplain’s  Office at the small liberal arts school where I worked, but it took a  long time to bring myself to do it. The workplace had become so toxic  that it was affecting my well-being. I also knew that when I left my  position as the Coordinator of Catholic Life would not be refilled. I  wasn’t worried about myself. I would be fine. I was worried about the  students I left behind. What would become of their thriving community?  As I had discovered, the progressivism that has suffused the atmosphere  of elite schools like mine does not always welcome religious students.  Indeed, it makes it difficult for students to engage with religion in a  serious way.  
&gt;  
&gt;Like many other American colleges that were originally religious  institutions, the one I worked in had become entirely secularized.  Founded in the late 1800s by Congregationalists, the historical heirs of  the Puritans, it had long ago thrown out its hymnals and removed the  cross from its historic main building. In part because it still had a  gorgeous chapel in the center of its campus to contend with, the college  retained two full-time Interfaith Chaplains and a Chaplain’s Office.  But even secular institutions such as this one recognized that religion  remains a vital source of campus life, being, for many students, an  important part of the college experience.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Chaplain’s Office at this college received money every year from  many sources, including the school’s endowed fund for Roman Catholic  Studies. With a tiny bit of that money, the Chaplain to the College  hired me to work part time as the Coordinator of Catholic Life. There  was also a part-time Coordinator of Jewish Life and a dozen or so  volunteers from various faith traditions. Catholics were the  second-largest religious identity on campus after Jews, although the  majority of students at the college claimed no religious affiliation at  all.  
&gt;  
&gt;When I took the job, I didn’t see my presence on campus as a Catholic  campus minister as controversial or political. I am a liberal, a  feminist, and myself a product of an “elite university.” Both  culturally, and in terms of my expertise, I thought I would be a good  fit for a progressive institution committed to helping students explore  their various identities, whether in terms of gender, race, sexuality,  or even religion.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I was unaware of the massive ideological changes that had taken  place on college campuses in the decade since I had graduated. Arriving  as a chaplain at a progressive secular college with traditional views of  what a liberal arts education in the humanities was about, I thought it  meant exploring different ways of being, and weighing different  narratives by bringing them into conversation with one another. I saw  religion as another identity to be explored and therefore essential to a  student’s experience and self-definition. I also considered the study  of comparative religions and the presence of religion on campus as  elements of a true multiculturalism.  
&gt;  
&gt;The two heads of the chaplaincy program were both ordained Protestant  ministers, but they tended to focus on Eastern and New Age style  offerings, from qigong and zen meditation to queer spirituality, yoga,  and tarot card nights in the chapel. Although I was passionate about  pluralism and often attended the events of other groups, I believed, as a  Roman Catholic woman, that I had something distinctive and important to  contribute to our students’ explorations of the varieties of religious  life. Specifically, I saw myself and the other part-time Coordinator of  Jewish Life as resources for students who wanted to explore what was  curiously called “Western spirituality.” If students were interested in  learning to make candles for Advent or in reading Pope Francis’s  encyclical on climate change, they came to me. Students of many faiths  or no faith took part. We had many agnostics who loved ritual and  fellowship with others in the group. It was pleasant for the students to  be a part of a community that wasn’t dedicated to résumé building. We  prayed *Lectio Divina* and cooked dinner together. The Catholic  community was more like a family, a family that reflected the ethnic and  racial diversity of the global church.  
&gt;  
&gt;And for a while at least, it seemed as though we were filling a need  for students interested in religious community. At a typical Thursday  night supper there might be fifteen students and eight different native  languages at the table. In a school that was 65 percent white and  American, we had black, white, Latino, Asian, Indigenous, and mixed  students—students from China, Poland, Kenya, France, Slovakia, Austria,  the Philippines, Mexico and Bangladesh. We had first-generation college  students and students whose parents were in the top 1 percent. We  also had a diversity of perspectives and viewpoints. As one student  said of our community suppers, “This is the only place on campus where I  have conversations with people who think differently than me.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The liberalism we all grew up with relegated religion to the private  sphere. And though this was an overly restrictive way of thinking about  religion, at least it tolerated religious minorities unless they broke  laws or infringed on the rights of others. A small group of Catholic  students at a liberal arts school meeting for Mass on Sunday nights in  an otherwise unused chapel wasn’t a problem. Such kids might be  considered weird, but they weren’t hurting anybody. The same went for  gathering on Friday nights for Shabbat. Modern liberalism even tended to  celebrate such displays of religion as reflections of individual choice  and freedom of religion and expression.  
&gt;  
&gt;But liberalism’s commitment to that kind of pluralism has been eroded  by what the writer Wesley Yang calls  “the successor ideology.” Rooted  in the critical race theory of the Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo  school, this ideology is far less tolerant of Jewish kids gathering for  Shabbat or Catholic kids for Mass. Under the influence of this form of  ideological thinking, students were coming to view religious services or  religious observance as part of the structure of  “white supremacy.”  
&gt;  
&gt;When I first began to encounter this pernicious form of intolerant  group-think, I was a bit incredulous. A “spiritual but not religious”  student who sometimes came to Catholic community events wearing her “I  support Planned Parenthood” pin told me, “It’s taboo to explore Western  spirituality, especially in liberal circles. I’m careful who I tell  about it.” She was not alone. Other students asked me not to take photos  of Mass and post them on social media. They didn’t want to be “outed”  as Catholic. One Catholic student who lost her faith and then found it  again told me, “When I stopped being a Catholic I made so many friends.”  The notion that a person couldn’t engage with a religious tradition  without endorsing every one of its views (or claims) was new to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;I had never thought of religions as fitting neatly into ideological  boxes. Religions consist of poetry, metaphor, art, ritual, and emotion,  among other things. Religions can also include practices that are  psychologically sustaining, such as self-scrutiny, repentance,  absolution, and meditation. Such features of religious life are ignored  by proponents of the successor ideology, who are determined to see  certain religions solely in terms of how they supposedly support  structures of political, social, and economic power.  
&gt;  
&gt;The drive to eliminate whiteness, masculinity, and heteronormativity  on college campuses has made entire religious traditions suspect,  particularly those that are absurdly lumped together as part of   “Western spirituality”—despite the inconvenient fact that the majority  of the world’s one billion Catholics are neither white nor western, or  that Judaism includes Africans and Arabs and other non-European peoples.  
&gt;  
&gt;In his book *How to be An Antiracist*, which our college  followed in formulating its antiracist plan, Kendi explains that ideas  are either racist or antiracist, bad or good. For Kendi, the disease of  racism is not about individual bias or acts of discrimination but about  systems that allow for disparate outcomes among groups. One  goal of the antiracism project, then, is “leveling group differences.”  Most people hear this and think as I did: Yes, let’s get rid of unequal  funding for public schools, reform the criminal justice system, or  implement reparations for black Americans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most people certainly don’t think that leveling group difference  means tinkering with the religious demographics of an institution. But  college administrators made it clear to me that members of certain  religious groups were overrepresented on campus. This was why the  college wanted to get rid of chaplaincy programs. I suddenly realized  what was at stake in the move from the civil rights work of Dr. Martin  Luther King Jr., Barack Obama, or Thomas Chatterton Williams, for  example, to the antiracism of Ibram Kendi or Robin DiAngelo. **Telling me  that the “number one priority of the college is antiracism,” my  supervisor in Student Life explained:**    
&gt;  
&gt;**And because of the colleges’ commitment to antiracism and equity the  question finally becomes, Is chaplaincy sustainable? Our Jewish  community has the support of its alumni donor. How do we manage that?  And Roman Catholic students and others interested in Catholicism can  apply for grants from an endowed fund for Roman Catholic Studies. And in  order to be antiracist we have to have equal resources for Hindu  students, Muslim students, Buddhist students, or we need to** ***do away with*** **Spiritual Life groups all together.**  
&gt;  
&gt;My supervisor was echoing Ibram X. Kendi, who writes, “If  discrimination is creating equity then it is antiracist.” Inequity, in  this case, means any difference between ethnic groups that isn’t  reflected in the racial demographics of the United States. How does this  relate to religion? I didn’t think that it did. But here this  administrator decided that because Jews, being a tiny percentage of the  US population are overrepresented in higher education generally, and at  the college where I worked in particular, antiracism in this instance  required that the number of Jewish students be reduced. Moreover,  because there were 60 students at Shabbat and only a handful of Muslim  students on campus, the Jewish group *should not exist*.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the hermetically sealed world of campus progressivism, the fact  that all of this sounds more than a little anti-Semitic is mostly  ignored. So is the idea that religion may have something to offer that  wellness programs, for example, cannot. And that is precisely what the  administration planned to replace the chaplaincy program with: wellness  education aimed at stress management, substance abuse, and sexual  safety.  
&gt;  
&gt;Self-care is important, of course. But it’s not the same as communal  worship, as blessing and breaking bread with people who pray for the  repose of the soul of your *abuela* and call you to see if you’re  okay after her funeral. Replacing religion with wellness is like  replacing poetry and music with massages and journaling and working out.  They all have value, but they are not the same.  
&gt;  
&gt;But wellness is deemed a suitable substitute for religious practice  because progressive administrators find it more “manageable.” After all,  questions of equity, in practice, are often questions about the  allocation of resources. So budgets are shifted around and monies moved  away from programs that are “for” members of a religious group but open  to all comers and toward programs “about” a particular cultural  celebration—even if the latter tend to be paper thin. So, for example,  we were treated to a campus-wide celebration of Diwali with an Indian  food buffet, but no Hindu spirituality in sight. And there was a  celebration of *Día de los Muertos* that gave students the opportunity to decorate sugar skulls and to see *ofrendas* in the hallways of the campus art museum, but these *ofrendas* did  not feature any explicitly Christian or Catholic imagery. It’s the  Epcot of cultural encounter. Ultimately, the successor ideology benefits  academics and administrators who use it to protect themselves from any  possible criticism or censure for being insufficiently antiracist, but  it provides students with nothing more than an ersatz, feel-good  simulacrum of diversity and equity.   
&gt;  
&gt;The cost of entry into America’s elite spaces, the college degree,  should not mean leaving behind the traditions and “metanarratives” that  have sustained your ancestors—unless, of course, that’s what you have  freely chosen. Nor should it mean forsaking the ability to engage  critically with ideas that form a critical part of Western liberal  thought. But that is what is increasingly being required, to the  impoverishment of all students, religious or not. 

Bold my emphasis. The college in question is Colorado College. 

Clearly, there are fundamental disagreements on what the highest moral goods should be. Catholics can agree that the ills of society need fought.

Is this a sign from God?,Lil_big_rose,1626115509,"Hello from an alternate account...

How do you work through trauma alone? I have a lot spanning from the time before I was born until I left home and even after that until today. It's something that has dogged me my whole life and I can't seem to escape its clutches. I can't afford therapy and have no friends. (I'm the person nobody likes.) I can't talk to family since they're at the root of the trauma and they're still not willing to face the past. I scoured the internet and called a bunch of therapists to see if they'd be willing to do sliding scale or pro bono counseling but most never responded or they said they couldn't. The few who were open to ""sliding scale"" still had really high rates. They basically gave you a discount of $20 off which isn't much help at all. I can't afford their ""sliding scale"" fees. This is over many years of regularly looking and calling. I have an inability to trust therapists anyway. I used to talk to a priest I know but I always feel guilty about it because I can tell he doesn't like me and probably finds me very annoying. Also an encounter with him recently scared me so now I'm kind of afraid to talk to him. 

Before I would just pray because God was the only one I could talk to and it was the only way to deal with anything. Everyone always tells me that you need people who will support you before you can work on healing and that maybe this isn't the time to work on things. But if that's true then I'll be dead before I can work on anything. I've already lived a long life and I've gone my whole life without having anyone who was truly there for me so the logical conclusion (on paper at least) is that maybe God doesn't want to heal me. Even though it affects everything in my life so I can't actually live a functional life if I don't resolve anything. It seems like prayer and faith are my only options still but that still leaves healing on the backburner.

Feeling very lost in my faith - torn between Catholicism and Orthodoxy,studyseason,1626114257,"I am currently Roman Catholic, having grown up in an atheist household. I'm feeling very lost in my faith, and I'm just not sure where to turn to. 

I grew up mostly agnostic, with a secular (although this was in truth Protestant) schooling that made me want to form a relationship with God. For many years I kind of felt like I missed the boat, I hadn't been baptised and I didn't know how to join a Church or what that even meant. I was struggling with severe depression, and it was after an attempt on my own life that I pushed to pursue a Church. I looked into Orthodoxy at the time, but I was really confused and put off by the perceived Ethnic nature of the Church. I'm not Syrian, Russian, Greek or so forth, so I (rightly or wrongly) felt that the Church wasn't for me. That I would be intruding. And on a surface level it conflicted with my idea of God's Church being universal in the sense that anyone could convert to it. If it existed to serve particular groups then it seemed to go against that message. So I didn't look any further into Orthodoxy. I was just too conflicted and confused on the matter, I was also scared about intruding upon a community.

I felt pulled towards Catholicism. I knew people that were Catholic, and I had seen people living the Catholic faith. I had an experience through prayer and watching a Mass stream that seemed to pull me towards Catholicism. I began attending a Catholic Church, and I really did feel like it helped my depression a lot. Although that could be just because going to Church forced some level of self care, and meant that I was regularly getting out of the house (I attended Mass multiple times a week before university started). It was never really a theological argument that brought me to Catholicism. I did believe in the Eucharist, which was something that conflicted with Protestantism ever being an option. My time attending Protestant services at school really felt lacking. I just felt called towards it. That this was where God was taking me.

I ended up in an abusive relationship with someone that hated Christianity, and this really drove a wedge in between myself and the faith. I wrongly thought that I could pray for his conversion, but instead I ended up falling away. I'm now in a position where I want to come back to God. I left that relationship, and now I want to build myself up again. And this has meant looking towards theology as something beyond reading superficial stories of Catholic Saints. Which is where I am now, feeling conflicted.

I had for a long while struggled to reconcile Marian apparitions with Christianity. [This](http://orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/marian_apparitions.aspx) particular article really put into words what I've been struggling with in regards to them. To a large extent I felt that the argument that the Virgin Mary points us towards her Son makes a lot of sense, but I feel like in reality a lot of people stop at just worshipping her. Some people (including Saints) dedicate themselves solely towards praying towards her, which feels 'wrong'. In Marian apparitions she is seen as controlling a wrathful and angry Jesus. I don't take argument with holding her in high regard, I certainly don't believe in dismissing her entirely, and I do still believe in asking for intercessory prayer. But I can't wrap my head around only praying towards her, and this idea that Jesus is someone that needs to be held back by His mother. 

Another thing that I really struggle with is this notion that purgatory is akin to hellfire. Where those who are deigned to go to Heaven are in excruciating pains of Hell, and some have to come to Earth and ask for x amount of Masses to be said to them in order to reach Heaven. Hearing stories of Priests saying figures enveloped in Hellfire asked for a Mass to be said for them feels more like a horror movie than Christianity. I don't actually know anything about the Orthodox conception of purgatory, but I do know that I'm left feeling that this conception of Purgatory as Hellfire is wrong in some way. Although I do appreciate that I'm not particularly knowledgeable or skilled in theological matters - I'm very open to being wrong on this.

The Filioque clause is an obvious one, I'm currently reading '[Saint Photius the Great - The Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit](http://www.myriobiblos.gr/texts/english/photios_mystagogy.html)' which is raising a lot of arguments that I am inclined to agree with. But I haven't read much else on the matter. I've also read '[A Comparison: Francis of Assisi and St. Seraphim of Sarov](http://orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/francis_sarov.aspx)' and agree with some of the points put forth about the distinction in humility of Orthodox and Catholic Saints and criticism of Catholic Mysticism.

I still struggle with mental health issues, recently being diagnosed with OCD. I'm a chronic overthinker that also tries to cling to certainty, and I feel very overwhelmed because there's so much that I'm uncertain about. I can't just dismiss the things that I'm feeling inclined to agree with. Whether I'm wrong in need of correction to remain in line with Catholicism, or to move towards Orthodoxy. I do feel like I'm betraying God and the Saints and I don't want to do that. I feel guilty even writing this and having these thoughts. I'm just left feeling very lost and I'm not sure where to go from here.

Does anyone have any advice? Any recommendations of books or other resources to check out? Has anyone been in a similar situation? What made you stay? Or what made you convert from Orthodoxy to Catholicism? Or what made you convert to Catholicism over Orthodoxy?

I'm sorry if I've worded any of this in a dismissive matter. I am really trying to take this seriously, and I am trying to be as respectful as possible. I am just in a lot of distress right now, I don't know where to turn or what to do. I have prayed about this, but I do also believe that action needs to follow prayer and I need to do something to alleviate the distress I'm in.",Catholicism

I have been struggling however, at least since COVID began, with my personal spirituality and prayer life.",CumbiaConLaLuna,1626112955,"When I converted it was like a new springtime for me. I was learning the rosary, dedicating myself to Mary, making small and large pilgrimages, and so on. Mass was a refreshing joy, and the Eucharist seemed incredibly awe inspiring. 

I then moved to be closer to my girlfriend, now wife, and shortly afterwards things began to take a slide downwards. Old habits crept back into my life I had no intention of ever seeing again, my prayer life began loosing steam and my daily rosary became a rare event.

Since joining the church I have stopped watching porn entirely, and I can resist the urge to masturbate greatly, but still, sometimes I relapse, or relapse into other sins of a sexual nature. 

But the thing is, I'm still fully aware that they are grave sins. If I declare myself as having a habitual sin (and therefore not a mortal one, apparently), isnt that making a big assumption?

"[Politics Monday] Statement by 60 Democrats in response to Bishops deciding to write document on Eucharist is mostly copy of the statement made in 2006 with few modifications, one of which is removal of ""and the undesirability of abortion – we do not celebrate its practice""",feb914,1626108252,"Varia —

As most readers know, a group of 60 Catholic Congressional Democrats released a “Statement of Principles” last month, in response to the prospect of a document on Eucharistic coherence drafted by the U.S. bishops.

Observers have noted that the statement was released almost immediately after it was announced that the bishops had voted to draft their document, and they’ve asked how the group got their statement together and published so quickly.

While a variety of theories have been floated, one astute reader of The Pillar found the answer.

Much of the 2021 “Statement of Principles” was lifted from a 2006 statement signed by 55 members of the House. The original text of that statement has been taken off the website on which it was published, but evidence of it can be found online.

There is, however, a key difference between 2006 and 2021, in one crucial paragraph. See if you can spot it:

The 2006 document:

&gt; “We envision a world in which every child belongs to a loving family and agree with the Catholic Church about the value of human life and the undesirability of abortion – we do not celebrate its practice. Each of us is committed to reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and creating an environment with policies that encourage pregnancies to be carried to term…”

The 2021 document:

&gt; “We envision a world in which every child belongs to a loving family and agree with the Catholic Church about the value of human life. Each of us is committed to reducing the number of unintended pregnancies and creating an environment with policies that encourage pregnancies to be carried to term…”

Did you catch it?

Excluded from the 2021 document is this phrase: “…and the undesirability of abortion – we do not celebrate its practice…”

Confused about Past Confessions,teyrnaofgwaren,1626103652,"Two years ago, I confessed a habitual grave sin, that I have been free of since then. The sin had been a habit for four years before I confessed it. During those years I went to confession, but I either didn't mention it or I alluded to it a few times in a way that I didn't actually have to say it. I don't think I had really understood how sinful it was then, but once I understood the gravity of it, I stopped the sin and confessed it clearly.

And recently (like I said, it's been two years since I confessed it), as I've been learning more, it's occured to me it may have been a sin that I didn't confess it at those previous confessions. If I hadn't fully understood the gravity of the sin and therefore hadn't confessed it, does that mean I concealed it, which would have been another grave sin? I don't think I had a good understanding of confession until after I confessed the habitual sin. 

Do I need to confess that I didn't confess the habitual sin until I found out that it was a grave sin? I think I had some idea that the habitual sin was wrong, even before I understood how grave it was, but since I didn't know if was grave, I don't think I could have known how serious it was to not confess it.

And now I've been to confession several times in the past two years since confessing the habitual sin and not saying that I may have concealed that sin. Have all my confessions been invalid?

If I say all this at my next confession, how much detail do I need to go into?

I'm afraid I'm alternating between scrupulosity and presumption as I've been trying to figure this out. Can anyone help me think through this?",Catholicism

What is the Consensus on Catholic Education? Is it worthwhile?,LessThanJake1,1626101148,"Hello all,

Long-time lurker, first time poster here. I’m a Catholic (convert technically, but I always grew up adjacent to the Church through my father, who returned to the Church when I was younger), and as a result of my engagement and marriage, I know that I’ve thought about this a bit prematurely. However, I wanted to see if I could get opinions from others in a forum dedicated to this great faith I call my home.

I’m almost certain that, in the next 3-4 years, my soon-to-be wife and I will have a child. This inevitably raises a question for me; whenever my child gets to that age, would it be better to enroll them in public school, or rather a parochial institution? I know home school is very unlikely because my (assuming I get in) medical school education will impede this, and I won’t even be able to hold a job while a student. 

I guess I’m curious if Catholic education is a worthwhile avenue for the future. I frankly had some horrendous public school experiences, as did my fiancée, and I know that makes us both wary. However, I want to make sure that I’m placing them in an environment conducive to learning while also retaining a connection to the faith.

I chose Bernard of Clairveaux as my confirmation name when I was younger, but didn't put much thought into it.

Should I refrain from communion if it is not given on the tongue?,osteo5511,1626099803,"&amp;#x200B;

I just moved to a new area. Upon attending mass, I realized that the archdiocese here still isn't allowing communion on the tongue. Luckily, I can get to a parish on Sunday that does have communion on the tongue. Sadly, I can not go to this church during the week because it is too far of a drive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go to daily mass and comune because I believe I need the graces that come with this to grow in holiness. This is especially true because I was recently confirmed and feel like I am a baby Catholic. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, I am extremely uncomfortable taking communion on the hand. I am afraid that this could lead to particles of The Eucharist being lost or that I could contaminate the Eucharist with my dirty hands. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do yall recommend? I am thinking I can wash my hands right before receiving then lick them to make sure none of the Blessed Sacrament is lost. I will probably look really weird but, hopefully, this doesn't make people too uncomfortable.

My current gripes with the church and what I'd like to see changed.,RDNolan,1626098468,"So I've been a catholic my whole life and have been wanting to share some changes I'd like to see in the Church. I'm don't know everything about papal or church laws but I'd like to see the church in a number of ways. I don't mean for this to get political at all.

1. Actual punishment for priests that commit acts that harm their followers like molestation or using church funds for personal gain. The church needs to outright remove them from the priesthood (probably not excommunication) as they turn Catholics away from the church and harm their flock.
2. More calls from the church to end persecution of followers of the faith to governments or groups. I'm tired of Catholics being persecuted and no one caring (one that really ticked me off was the Easter worshippers thing a couple years ago). I know we should preach peace but we should also preach defending the faith from this persecution. I don't want to turn the faith into the days of the papal state and crusades but something must happen.
3. More focus on corruption in the church and out. Corruption should be one of the biggest things that should be cast out of the church and should be focused on today. To me, corruption is probably one of the most dangerous things for our faith.

This is just some gripes I've had with the church recently and some stuff I'd like to see changed. I realize that the papacy doesn't have that much power these days but, to me, reform is needed if we ant to continue.",Catholicism

Ressources to learn about catholicism,Jufispzr,1626089547,"Hello,

First, I would like to introduce myself, i am a 26-year-old man living in France in the Paris region. I regularly follow this sub-reddit without actually being a Catholic per se, I was just baptized when I was born.

In recent months / years, I have felt more and more affinity with the Christian religion, for no particular reason. I ask myself a lot of questions, about life, death, the reason for our presence here ... Until now I was always far from religion. It must be said that I grew up in a family that strayed from their beliefs, but I would like to learn more.

I like to visit churches more and more, I find there a special atmosphere which is really incredible, I also attended several masses.

The believers I have met have always inspired me, with their faith, and I always felt that they had found peace, serenity and their reason for living.

What ressources can i read / watch to learn more without going straight away to meet a priest? I try to confirm what I think before taking any steps, and i think the bible isn't the best thing to start since it's very long and i won't understand everything.

To be honest i'm a bit lost in the wide variety of youtube videos, books and i want to learn how catholic have to act to follow the precept of the religions and so many other things.

Guidance for my first Confession,GeneralStoic,1626075587,"Hello there. Apologies for the long write up, but please bare with me. 


A brief backstory; I was born into a Catholic family (my family on both sides have been Catholic for generations as far back as I can go) and was baptised as an infant. As a child, I would go to the Sunday School at the local Anglican Church (my Dad wanted me to go to a more child friendly church that had a Sunday School because he thought I wouldn't actually learn anything going to the Sunday Mass at the Catholic church with no Sunday School), as well as studying in an optional RE class in primary school. Then, I went to the local Catholic High school as a teenager, which obviously had RE as well. 


Now, even though I was Baptised, went to Sunday school, RE at primary school and went to the Catholic high school, my family were not devout by any means and didn't do communion or confession, or were involved in any other Catholic traditions. though of course, we were taught about and believed in Jesus. Basically, not eating meat and having fish on Good Friday was as devout as we got (also watched the standard Jesus movie every year on good friday as our way of worship). 


As I got older, I still had my belief in Jesus, though I had started to get my own ideas of who He was and who God was that would of certainly been borderline, if not straight up, Hersey. By the time I was an adult, even though I knew Jesus was a real man that walked the earth (from the facts of the historical record), the idea that He was God was basically non existent in my mind. In those years, I obviously lived a life away from God and lived in Sin. 


I should note; in those adult years, I began to feel disdain for the Catholic Church due to the corruption in the Papacy, as well as the rampant child molestation and cover ups by the church, which in turn, I refused to call myself Catholic and only called myself Christian (by label only). 


When I was 28, after years of living in Sin, addictions and depression, I found myself in a dark place, and I started to look for answers about life and the universe again. First, I was looking into the New Age bullshit (law of attraction, The Secret, etc). That didn't work, so I turned to Islam, and while that certainly made a lot of sense for a time, I started to realise the contradictions and false teachings of Islam, So, finally, I turned to Jesus and Christianity and came back to God. 


When I finally turned to Jesus, I noticed a shift in my life, and everything started making sense. I prayed, and Jesus guided me and showed me many signs, leading me to the path of righteousness and His will. However, I still struggled with Sin and addiction, and no matter how many times I prayed for forgiveness, I still fell back to the same repeated sinful cycle. Now, again, should note, while I was living as a Christian again (almost), I still felt disdain for the Catholic church, for the same reasons as above. I was a Non-denominational Christian, I didn't go to church, and (as I told myself), I was walking the path with God on my own. 


Now, to wrap up the story, in recent months, I've caught up with a friend, who is a devout Catholic, which on both occasions (a few months apart) we talked about our beliefs, debated about differences and the like, and the one thing he told me was why Catholicism was ""right"" (for lack of a better term) was because of the Tradition of the church, and the teachings of the Saints in that Tradition. Though I acknowledged his reasons, my emotions and the disdain I felt for the Catholic church was clouding my judgement and I couldn't get past it. Now a few days after the last catch up (was only literally 10 days ago), I came across a video of Fr. Mike Schmitz about Catholicism, I put my emotions aside, and after watching it, I finally understood what my friend was trying to tell me about the Catholic church and Tradition. I thanked my friend and admitted I was wrong, I prayed to God, thanking Him for showing me the way, and from that moment on, I was Catholic, again. 


So, The reason for this post. Now that I believe in Catholicism, my first step is to make my first Confession. Obviously, from above, I've never made a confession before in the 30 years of my life, and to say there is an long list of Sin would be an understatement. I have been watching a few videos on Confession, mainly from Dr. Mike Schmitz and the Ascension Presents YouTube channel, and I have a bit of an understanding of what I need to do (his advice is to write in a book of the Sins that I can remember, or at least the more serious ones). I have also prayed, but I wanted to come to this Sub as well and ask for advice and guidance on the best way to go about doing it.

Isn't that a reward?",Uninterrupted-Void,1626055417,"I watched Father Ripperger's video on hell, and I heard 2 things that stuck out at me from the rest of the sadistic acid trip:

1: In hell, people are possessed by demons, and they violate you in unspeakable ways: violating your body, violating your mind, etc.

2: Demons like to possess people because it distracts them from their torture. I guess they just get off on hurting people, I guess they are psychopaths and sadists.

How to approach the Catholic Faith again after not practicing for a decade?,red_condor,1626055259,"A little context. I was raised catholic and live in a country of strong catholic background. I was baptized and received eucharist for the first time as kid. However I distanced myself from the faith after I turned 14 and went through a lot of different phases in the last 10 years including atheism. 

A couple years back I approchead the subject of faith again and the more I looked for arguments and reasoned about it, the more I felt I needed to back. 

So today I finally decided to the mass again after years and it was a great experience. Still I couldn't complete every prayer, didn't quite remember the sequence and wasn't comfortable to take communion again.

Protestant trying to understand Roman Catholicism: a question about uniformity,TheDevLee,1626051719,"Hey everyone, your friendly neighborhood protestant trying to understand my brethren (or at least that's the way I see it!). I have been exploring Catholicism for a while now, and certainly have had to evaluate my own beliefs on things like Sola Scriptura, Sola Fide, and baptismal regeneration. Suffice it to say that calling myself a protestant is getting harder by the day, and there is a lot I am sorting out. One thing came to mind today that I would like some guidance on.

A huge appeal to me about RC is its unity, meaning there is official doctrine and a hierarchy that one can go to to correct false teachings. That being said, I understand that there is purposely left some play in the joints. Attending a mass today, the priest brought up that a possible explanation for the feeding of the 5000 is that the people had food but were so influenced by the love of Christ and his blessing that they shared their food with one another, hence a natural explanation. I did some googling and found that the catechism seems to not endorse this view. This leads me to further questions, like the huge number of RC who hold views that are simply counter to what the church teaches, namely views on homosexuality and abortion. I would say that official theology is more important than churchgoers who may range from Catholic in name only to truly devout, but the fact that a priest holds a view I find to be so anti-Biblical but also evidently anti-RC makes me question the unity that seems attractive to me about Roman Catholicism. What would all of you say to a protestant like me who feels this lack of unity is potentially not much better than protestantism and its many denominations? Also, how common is this? Do you have to search around Catholic churches to find one that adheres to the official teachings in the catechism? Thanks!",Catholicism

Suggestions to encourage my non-Catholic wife to explore the faith,nofapfiend,1626050055,"Hello!

My wife and I were married in the Catholic church recently and I'm trying to find ways to encourage her to explore Catholicism. Obviously we are very much in love with each other despite our different Christian upbringings - she is non-denominational albeit not very religious. When we went through our marriage counseling with the Church we took part in a very enlightening retreat that we both got alot out of. For a time she was actually interested in converting to Catholicism which I was of course extremely happy to hear! However she has not yet gone through RCIA and seemed to lose interest over time - I think mainly because when we got to the part of the pre-marriage course about NFP (Natural Family Planning) which she was not really a fan of, it turned her off. Admittedly, I think the course instructors were a bit abrasive with it basically saying stuff like ""when you're ready to stop polluting your body with the pills etc."" - that really grinded her gears. 

She has attended Mass with me on occasion even though she doesn't fully understand what is going on and it's hard for her to keep her attention. She goes because she knows it's important to me, but deep down my hope is that she eventually does get something out of it and find interest in converting again. Of course, her not being Catholic has never been a deal breaker in our relationship. I have been Catholic all my life and will continue to be (I'm not the best but I do try!) I'm trying to figure out ways to encourage her, without pressuring, to explore and potentially renew her interest. Like I said, I do invite her to mass, a lot of times she declines, which again, not a big deal as I understand it can be hard to comprehend for someone who did not grow up with it and does not know much about Catholicism (of course most of her knowledge comes from the negative things she's heard from the media causing stigma). I've tried to give her some resources about Mass and what it means to Catholics but she's not really interested in reading them.

Anyway, I'm looking for suggestions for ways to help spark that interest that she initially had. Of course I always pray that God will somehow turn her heart, if it be His will. I just think it would be great for our marriage in the long run if she converted as well. 

Any and all ideas welcome!

I'm in danger of losing my faith,obwia,1626049559,"So, I pretty sure I have OCD especially scrupulosity. It manifests in various ways, as a kid I would pray excessively and feared if I didn't pray enough or pray with upmost reverence that God would punish me. 

Recently, its been manifesting in the form of me thinking that I committed a mortal sin before mass each Sunday. Its been really stressful, and I get late to church stressing over it. 

Today it was really bad. I'm having this OCD thoughts that say that God doesn't exist. More specifically, it takes known proofs for God and makes me think of all the ""What if's?"" Like the intelligent design theory for example. What if it really was just luck, or what if the universe if infinite, so there were infinite chances for it to happen, etc.

Then I began to question miracles of the church. Such as Fatima in particular. Why if it is true, haven't atheists turned to God? And why weren't there any pictures of the miracle of the sun?

I also began to question the events that happened in the bible. Such as did Jesus really exist? And I began to look up archeological evidence for things like the exodus story. But, all I found were a few debunked stories of chariots and skeletons. Why hasn't there been found huge piles of skeletons, and chariots? (Pls someone answer this)

My personal biggest proof of God for me comes from the prosperity of the church teachings. When one truly lives up to the laws of Catholicism, they experience a life full of happiness and purpose. I myself experienced this when I got right with God and confessed my multitude of sins I was hiding, and began to take my faith seriously. But, I'm having these thoughts that say ""What if this isn't true"", ""What if its just a set of rules to make me have a false feeling of purpose, and that there is no real purpose in life. People just make it up to feel important or satisfied."" and ""What if these teachings are in fact good, but there isn't any God behind them. Its just a collaboration based off trial and errors of humans in the past trying to find the best way to live and have that false sense of purpose to feel satisfied. 

I really don't like these thoughts and feelings. I spent the whole day trying to find evidence and all. Its exhausting. Honestly, if no God exists, I would be hugely bummed and broken hearted, as I would have no purpose in life. I don't want to lose my faith. Being Catholic has been the best blessing I have ever had.

Looking for some advice from someone knowledgeable on meditation/mindfulness,LollaPopCan,1626043380,"I’ve been interested in meditation for some time now, mainly as a way to help manage my anxiety, but also as a way to live more in the moment and engage with others better. I recently started reading a book called the Untethered Soul, and had some questions arise in regards to some of the ideas introduced. 

One thing I’d like to note is that I always read things like this with a discerning eye, realizing that some of the stuff that may be discussed does not fall in line with my beliefs as a Catholic/Christian, and that I need to be aware to to take only those things that are correct and to leave the rest.

So in the book, the main idea boils down to pretty much the need for us humans to be aware and present. That thoughts and situations will arise in our life but we are to just experience them in that moment aware of what is going on, but to then let that moment pass and not to cling to it. That our past/experiences don’t define who we are, and the future we create in our minds doesn’t exist, so there is no point worrying about it.  Indeed this is also mentioned in the Bible as well, but I can’t help but feel that the book is talking about it differently somehow than the Bible. For one I know that awareness in the present moment needs to be tied to my awareness of Christ and how it is only through him that this moment can exist. But I struggle on some other questions regarding always being present and aware. 

It seems to me that there are times in life where it is necessary to get lost in thought, to think about situations or to plan for something that we may need to accomplish.  Say someone close to me were to pass away, from the wisdom of The Untethered Soul, it seems to me I should just experience those emotions once and not mourn them in the proper way, and to just let those thoughts/feelings pass by.  This just seems incorrect to me.  Or say I commit a sin that I know displeases God.  I feel I should have a sense of guilt, that I need to take time to think about my actions, and decide how I can better follow Christ in the future. Also questions about our past… isn’t our past important? Can’t we learn from it?

So I guess my question is knowing that both the Untethered Soul and the Bible embrace the concept of mindfulness, how is it that what I mentioned above about getting lost in thoughts possible? Am I only supposed to be mindful some of the time? Like as much as I can? But realizing there are times when I will not be able to? That seems to me like it defeats the purpose of mindfulness….. maybe I’m reading to much into it.",Catholicism

What would be your rebuke to this Unitarian argument against the deity of Christ in Hebrews?,TexanLoneStar,1626040190,"

Hebrews 1:10

&gt;In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. (NIV)

This verse is quoted from the Old Testament (Ps.102:25), where it applied to Yahweh, and the author of Hebrews is lifting it from the Psalms and applying it to Jesus Christ.  The subject of the verse changes from Yahweh (Old Testament) to Jesus Christ (New Testament).  It makes sense, therefore, that the action being attributed changes also.  Many Old Testament verses testify that God created the original heavens and the earth (Gen. 1:1, etc.)  However, both the Old Testament and New Testament tell us that there will be a new heavens and earth after this one we are currently inhabiting.  In fact, there will be two more.  First the heaven and earth of the Millennium, the 1000 years Christ rules the earth, which will perish (Isa. 65:17; Rev. 20:1-10), and then the heaven and earth of Revelation 21:1ff, which will exist forever.  The context reveals clearly that Hebrews 1:10 is speaking of these future heavens and earth.  If we simply continue to read in Hebrews, remembering that the original texts had no chapter breaks, Scripture tells us, “It is not to angels that He has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking” (Heb. 2:5).  This verse is very clear.  The subject of this section of Scripture is not the current heavens and earth, but the future heavens and earth.  The reader must remember that the word “beginning” does not have to apply to the absolute beginning of time, but rather the beginning of something the author is referring to (see the note on this on John 6:64).  When this verse is referring to the work of the Father, as it is in the Old Testament, it refers to the beginning of the entire heavens and earth.  When it is applied to the Son, it refers to the beginning of his work, not the beginning of all creation, as Hebrews 2:5 makes clear.

Finding true masculinity on good priests,holeofthemoon,1626035419,"I think nobody would question the fact that men are constantly being demoralized and heavily pushed to lower himself to all sorts of weakness. How many self-help gurus didn't make millions by pretending to solve this issue tho? Whereas I think the solution for this problem is on good Catholic men, specially priests who are our spiritual fathers after all.

Sadly, the image of priesthood is now associated with sexual abuse and the most despicable behaviors of infiltrated men that seem to have chosen to be Satan's agents. But let's set these sad men aside for a second and try to believe that in this world there still are men with a golden heart chosen by Our Lord to keep the Church alive to not let the gates of Hell prevail.  
  
Hope you have also seen them. They're incredibly intelligent and they speak with such a clarity of thoughts that is more than satisfying to hear. Unlike coachers, there's no need to use an imposing posture since the truth is convincing on itself. And a priest who went to a good seminary will probably learn how to ""tame"" his lower faculties and to put his soul in a reasonable order by developing virtues. And although we shouldn't always trust our eyes, it's so beautiful to see how serene and neat these priests are.   
  
A while ago I saw this young priest who is probably in his early 30s and -- with all due respect -- he reminded me of the elfs from the Lord of the Rings. He was playing with the students and not even for a moment he acted clumsy, even when running he kept his good posture. How otherworldly he looked! And it's not only him but there were other priests like him, all young and well constituted. How lucky are these little boys to have such a great example of manhood. It made me so happy to see it!  
  
What a difference that good Catholic men can do! There's also this story of this French missionary man  whose life is now a closed and inspiring book. He was more good-looking than most of Hollywood actors I've seen, and still he gave his entire self to Our Lord. He could've had all the pleasures the world could give, since he possessed so many desirable qualities, but his love for Our Lord made him choose the best part! And now we know he really had a pius soul cos his fruits are still blossoming even though he's no longer in this world. There's still hope!  

I pray to the Virgin Mary and to St Joseph to help men struggling with their vices to receive the graces they need to be the men they are called to be. I also pray for the Queen of clergy to give us holy priests, because that's what we all need.

I go to the bathroom to pee and get tissue, but before I peed i sort of squeezed to get the remaining semen out (like when you try getting those last few drops of pee out) before i start peeing. Im just a bit anxious because before i went back to sleep I noticed that this mightve been a mortal sin. 

So now im writing this right before i sleep so that maybe there would be an answer by the time i wake back up again.

Did squeezing to push the remaining semen out count as a mortal sin?

*note: to clarify, i did not use my hand to squeeze my penis. I dont know how to explain but i guess i sort of squeezed my urethra? Im not exactly sure what body part but if anyone can relate to the squeezing remaining pee out, then its something like that.",Catholicism

Our first Mass experience,atadbitcatobsessed,1626026991,"Last week I made a post on here about how my husband and I wanted to explore the Catholic church. (We are currently going to a non-denominational one). Well this morning we went to our first Mass. Here are my thoughts (in no particular order):

1. The building was beautiful and felt very comforting. There is something extra soothing about being in a traditional church versus a modern one.
2. I expected to see an older crowd than our current church. But I was surprised to see how many young children and teenagers were there. It was nice to see a wide variety of ages worshipping together.
3. The Priest gave a lovely homily, but I won't go into detail. In summary: he was not afraid to hold back, unlike the feel-goody services that a lot of non-denominational churches focus on.
4. Although it was only 45 minutes (we are used to 90ish minutes), we liked how it was ""to the point."" It moved so swiftly and beautifully.

Out of the 2 of us, my husband is the more ""casual one"". (He has only ever known non-denominational, but I grew up Methodist, so it wasn't total culture shock to me). So I was worried about how he would feel about it. 

Afterwards, he said he found it to be very nice. He admitted that the one thing that holds him is that he likes the modern aspects of our current church (songs lyrics up on a board, mics around so all can hear clearly, etc). But to my surprise, he said let's attend again next weekend to explore this more.

Personally, I thought the whole service was so beautiful and I felt more comfortable than I thought I would. I felt the presence of God in a way that I'm not sure I do at our current church.

Side note: Last night on the drive home from a friend's house, we were talking about which service time to go to, and then the song ""Let it Be"" came on the radio. And the lyrics about Mother Mary came on right as I was thinking about that. The next morning, when we pulled into the church parking lot, the only spots left out of the rather large lot were in front of the Blessed Mother statue. Coincidences? I don't know.",Catholicism

"Is Burning Incense to Statues and Icons condemned in 2 Kings 18:4 with the Bronze Serpent? If not, is their any action that can be considered an OBJECTIVE act of worship? Meaning that no matter how you personally agreed, the act itself is enough for it to be considerd idolatry.",dannation99,1626025877,"2 Kings 18:4 He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Ashe’rah. And he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had burned incense to it; it was called Nehush’tan.

Many catholics use this passage to show that veneration icons is ok as long as it's not worship. However catholics also will burn incense on objects such as icons, bibles, altars etc. Does this mean therefore that burning incense is not intrinsically evil? And that it is only idolatry if you intended it in your heart. For example during Roman Persecution, Christians were orderd to burn incense to ceaser and the pagan idols. If the person in his heart does not intend to worship, but does the act anyway, did he apostatize or not? If it was objective idolatry, no matter whether the person agreed in his heart or not. That would mean there is something objective in the act of burning incense. 

This also confuses me about sacrfice. burning incense in scripture is always called a sacrfice. Is it ok to offer incense to someone els other than christ?

If sacrfice is not an objective act of Worship, can one participate in an animal sacrfice, but have no intention of worship in his heart?",Catholicism

I went through RCIA in 1986, but it was at a liberal college student parish and I didn’t learn much theology.

In 1989 I was taking a gap year, working after college, and lived with my parents.  I volunteered at a soup kitchen.  One night I drove home from a church party.  Earlier that day several of my friends had gifted me a Mary statue.  The statue was in my car trunk.  I was driving several friends and their child home.  Suddenly a speeding car hit us and my car was totaled.  We escaped with only small cuts and a bit of whiplash.

In the 1990s I was a grad student and a member of the parish nearest the campus.  I was part of a prayer group.  There were several women and we each took one week a month hosting a large Mary statue in our home.  I was struggling with asthma and felt so much better, mentally and physically, when it was my week to host Mary.

Catechism of the Catholic Church quotes that all Christians can learn from on social and spiritual issues.,Anglicanpolitics123,1626005278,"""It is also blasphemous to make use of God's name to cover up criminal practices, to reduce peoples to servitude, to torture persons or put them to death. The misuses of God's name to commit a crime can provoke others to repudiate religion. Blasphemy is contrary to the respect due to God and his holy name. It is in itself a grave sin""(prg 2148)

""The word became flesh to be our model of holiness: 'Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me'. 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me'. On the mountain of transfiguration, the Father commands: 'Listen to him!'. Jesus is the model for the beatitudes and the norm of the new law: 'Love one another as I have loved you'. This love implies an effective offering of oneself, after his example""(prg 459)

""Jesus shares the life of the poor, from the cradle to the cross; he experiences hunger, thirst and privation. Jesus identifies himself with the poor of every kind and makes active love towards them the condition for entering his kingdom""(prg 544)

""By embracing in his human heart the Father's love for humanity, Jesus 'loved them to the end' for 'greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend'. In suffering and death his humanity became the free and perfect instrument of his divine love which desires the salvation of humanity.""(prg 609)

""The citizen is obliged in conscience not to follow directives of civil authorities when they are contrary to the demands of the moral order, to the fundamental rights of persons or the teachings of the Gospel. Refusing obedience to civil authorities, when their demands are contrary to those of an upright conscience, find its justification in the distinction between serving God and serving the political community. 'Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's'. 'We must obey God rather than men'""(Prg 2242)

""Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of those who cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized. It prompted our Lord to utter this curse: 'Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea'. Scandal is grave when given by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others. Jesus reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this account: he likens them to wolves in sheep's clothing""(Prg 2285)

""In economic matters, respect for human dignity requires the practise of the virtue of temperance, so as to moderate attachment to this world's goods; the practise of the virtue of justice, to preserve our neighbor's rights and render him what is due; and the practise of solidarity, in accordance with the golden rule and in keeping with generosity of the Lord, who 'though he was rich, yet for your sake......became poor so that by his poverty, you might become rich""(prg 2407)

""Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and man, which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation. A danger of modern warfare is that it provides the opportunity to those who posses modern scientific weapons-especially atomic, biological or chemical weapons-to commit such crimes""(prg 2314)

""Every offense committed against justice and truth entails the duty of reparation, even if its author has been forgiven. When it is impossible publicly to make reparation for a wrong, it must be made secretly. If someone who has suffered harm cannot be directly compensated, they must be given moral satisfaction in the name of charity. This duty of reparation also concerns against another's reputation. This reparation, moral and sometimes material, must be evaluated in terms of the extent of the damage inflicted. It obliges in conscience""(prg 2487)

""Before Pilate, Christ proclaims that he 'has come into the world, to bear witness to the truth'. The Christian is not to 'be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord'.

Help! Vey strange experience during Mass at new parish. Legit?,GamingCatholic,1625996398,"Hello and God bless you all!

Today I went to mass in a very long time (Covid restrictions).  
I recently moved so this is my first time I attended Mass in this parish.

The initial outlook was great: a full Church (average age 60+) and everybody very friendly.

Then Mass started: all still OK.  
But then VERY strange things happened:

* The second reading (Ephesians 1:3-14) was skipped completely
* A woman (by a lack of knowing the term) who was involved did the Gospel Reading, gave the Homily and send us away when the Mass ended.
* No Gloria, Sanctus, Agnus Dei etc. were sung. Not even in my native language. The Our Father was partly OK as it was sung.
* NO CONSECRATION of the Bread and Wine.  
\--&gt; There was no wine AT ALL  
After singing the Our Father the Eucharist was handed out almost immediately without any real prayer (except the 'but enter under my roof' one).

I'm actually quite shocked, as I haven't been to Mass for a long time not only due to Covid, but also due to an atheistic mindset. I'd hoped that at least this parish was going to be OK, but this again looked almost like a clown NO mass.  
I've not hate for NO masses, as I've attended/joined amazing online masses in the past.

I did not receive the Eucharist here, as I need to go to Confession, but I think I'm not to receive the Eucharist here as it's not treated the way it should be.

I'm 20F, I'm not Catholic as I have said in the title. However, my partner is, so I'm sometimes curious to know what their religion's point of view is on certain things.
I do believe in God and Jesus, I'm just not sure of the exact name of the ""belief"" (I'm not a native English speaker, I just know I'm not Catholic).

I am asexual, and my partner is too. What it means is we don't feel sexual attraction to people. When looking at someone, regardless of gender, no matter how close we may feel to them, we don't feel anything ""sexual"" to them. To compare, it's like saying a heterosexual woman is not sexually attracted to women, just like a heterosexual man isn't to men. Asexuality is just being attracted to neither.

Romantic and sexual attractions are considered separate : someone can be sexually attracted so someone without loving them, just like there can be romantic love even if there's no sex.

We are asexual but we do love each other romantically, we're both women.

I hope I explained it well enough for people unfamiliar with it.

Why I came here is because I wanted to know what do Catholics think about this. From what I remember, the Bible only mentions sex between two women and two men, but nothing about just romantic love. I might be wrong of course. What's your view on same-sex couples who only love each other romantically ? How about same-sex couples who are attracted to each other sexually but chose not to act on it and live together as a couple ?

Please pray for me.,markusmatthewhill,1625975184,"Lately, I've been feeling terrible. I've been depressed for almost a year, for many reasons. 

I'm fighting a terrible, decade long addiction. 

My solo music career is really struggling to get off the ground, despite all the mass amounts of money and support thrown into it from myself and my family. 

I constantly feel like those around me don't like me but it doesn't even make sense, and sometimes I say that and they always console me. 

I've gotten to a point where I hate life. The worst part is that I'm not even Catholic. I haven't even started RCIA yet so I can't even receive the body and blood, soul and divinity of Christ. I cannot be baptized. I cannot be absolved of my many sins and transgressions. 

I'm not even 20 years old yet but the imminence of adulthood weighs heavily on me, and the fact that my career refuses to start hurts me so dearly. 

One of my biggest goals with my career is to become huge. Like - 80 million monthly listeners on spotify huge. 

Why? Because I want money. I want a platform. 

But I want money so that I can give it to the Church and the poor and charities and be charitable to those around me. I also want the freedom associated with it but I used to only have selfish desires regarding this. 

And I want a platform not for fame solely but so I can spread the good news of the Lord and reach many people, whether or not a song is religious in content. My other goal is to change the world of music - to make people able to engage with it again, truly. To again become a Godly artform that is appreciated as such and not just used as background music. 
I don't mean everything has to be Gospel music. Far from it. I just mean that I want us to understand that God given importance of music again. 

And those two things make this all so much worse. Nothing is coming of this and it seems like everything is falling apart. 

I want death so I can be rid of this terrible plane of existence and enter the kingdom of heaven but I am not suicidal. 

What I truly want is to be rid of this plague which harms those around me and makes me nothing.",Catholicism

“I’m Christian not Catholic” &amp; “Non-Denominational” Churches,erjwei,1625966738,"I have to get this off my chest. This drives me nuts. When people say something like “Whether you’re Catholic or Christian” or “I’m Catholic” “Oh? I’m Christian.”

How do you respond when people say stuff like this? It’s usually evangelical “non-denominational” Protestants. How did “Christian” become the term for “Protestant?” 

I gently corrected my friend and said, “Catholics are Christians,” to which she replied, “Oh I know, but like, Christian Christian, you know? Just general Christian.” I said, “I think you mean Protestant,” and she replied, “What’s that?” (Cue internal screaming.)

I know it annoys me way more than it should. Does anyone know the denominational/theological roots of “non-denominational” churches? The same friend was inviting people to church (fine) under the pretense that it was “non-denominational” and therefore “neutral” and “not pushing anything specific.” 

Yes it is! It’s a very specific and recent way of reading the Bible and being a Christian. And in my humble opinion, not a super great one.

"The hostile times we live in will make us better Christians, and we should be happy for it!",StrongmanCole,1625963011,"We have a lot going against us at the moment, there is no question. From the major institutions of our society being hijacked by secular radicals that preach madness and hate, to the incendiary infighting between members of the Church herself, we have a lot on our plate. But we should make a point to remember that we have overcame bigger hurdles before, and each one that we have overcome has only served to strengthen our resolve as soldiers of Christ.

When I look at the modern world and see how much more difficult it is to live an orthodox lifestyle today than it was in the past, I do not despair. Instead, I feel a great sense of honor.

Honor that God has personally picked me to be his soldier in these difficult times. God never puts us in a fight he doesn’t think we can win. And for him to believe that we can win against the overwhelming forces that threaten us today makes me want to weep with joy, that I am to be so blessed to receive such a privilege.

So always remember to never despair, for we have been saved by the blood of Christ. And as he overcame death and the forces of Hell, so too shall we overcome the demons of our time and continue forward on the long path towards the eternal love and joy that is the Kingdom of God.

However, I have anti catholic fundamentalist parents and no car in the suburbs so I could never get there. Well, I’m applying for jobs right now so I can buy my own car and my parents drive to the interview site. Literally yesterday, I had an epiphany to tell my parents I applied to the McDonalds down the street then when they drove off I’d go to Saturday Vigil Mass (I know that’s bad but I saw an open door so I used it). So I put that plan into action today and when they left I hurried over to the church. 

Things I noticed: It had a distinct smell, statues and paintings littered everywhere. There were people there praying (never have I seen in evangelical churches people praying before the service), it was mostly empty nesters but there were a good amount of families there. There were more in attendance than I thought there would be. It was diverse too. Good homily about charity but I kind of wasn’t paying attention because I was too excited to be there so my mind was racing. Some people were talking before Mass but it was mostly noise from the narthex. Yes, people didn’t really talk to me but at my parents church we just leave after the service so I’m indifferent. However, during the sign of peace (which I do like, I’m ready for the tomatoes) the guy in front of me complimented my suit and it made me happy. They sang good hymns… nothing folk music. After Mass I wanted to talk to the priest but I had to run back to McDonalds before my parents got there. Then, they asked how my interview went and I made up details so they wouldn’t know where I really was. (God forgive me for lying)

All in all, I had a good time and can’t wait for when I can attend freely.

I just thought I'd share because I still don't know how to handle it.",llamarloon,1625944518,"So, I was born Catholic and became irreligious in my late teens. In my early 20's I was at a dead-end in life and decided to go down a rabbit hole of studying spirituality and philosophy. I loved Greek and Roman philosophy, and I also became enamored with Islam (although I never attended a mosque or became a fully practicing muslim)

Over the next few years, I simply remained a ""love of knowledge"" - and continued my spiritual and intellectual journey.

There were 2 instances about 2-3 years ago in which I used mushrooms and LSD. I did both alone, and utilized religious music/chanting. I remember finding myself stuck on Orthodox/Catholic chants, as well as looking at various iconography of Mary and Jesus. (I also listened to buddhist chanting/eastern instrumentals as well as Quranic recitation/zikr meditation chanting - but those didn't move anything in me)

I can't explain it, but I had an extremely intimate and spiritual experience, an ""Aha!"" moment in which I felt like I finally ""got"" what the Trinity meant, and the deeper significance of Christian doctrine. I don't even have the vocabulary to explain it now, but something clicked - I can feel that deep in my bones.

As for what the Catholic church has to say:  

https://www.catholic.com/qa/do-animals-have-souls-like-human-beings  

Ergo, ""God"" means absolutely nothing to me and I would rather join my family of pets in no afterlife than one without them. If there is an afterlife where say the absence of God/Devil exists but requires my soul, they may take it because God does not deserve it.  
  
Going to remove this or ban me? Well that would just prove how weak the Catholic church really is. How about talking and debating with me why God would create a world filled with suffering for both humans and animals followed by only allowing human ""souls"" into ""heaven"". How about insects? Plants? Those are living things too so they should have souls as well. Fungi?

Flags in Church?,dhawk64,1625935002,"The church that I regularly attend has a U.S. flag on one side of the altar and the flag of Vatican City on the other. I was wondering if this is common throughout the United States and in other countries.

In my opinion, it is inappropriate to have the U.S. flag on the altar, because the Church is not about early authority. Praying for politicians does make sense to me.

An Orthodox Priest Converting to Catholicism?,pointed_star,1625930951,"**This is a question that the Canon Law subscribers to this sub would enjoy.**

A particular clergyman was ordained in the Old Catholic Church of Utrecht in 1994. A record of his seminary studies as well as an extensive record of the lines of apostolic succession of the bishop ordaining him is available. From the documents it is clear that (1) All the essential elements of a valid ordination have been met (presentation of gifts, laying on of hands etc.) (2) the minister stands in full apostolic succession and so has valid orders. Although he never took a vow of celibacy at ordination (only obedience), he has chosen to live a celebrate life.

Due to increased modernist tendencies in the Old Catholic Church, the clergyman wishes to seek full communion with Rome.

How do Americans Catholics deal with the constant stream of hate from evangelicals?,Delicious-Owl-3672,1625925723,"I'm a European Catholic, who lived in the US for a year, and though it pains me to admit it, I have an intense dislike for evangelicals, to the point I would not call them Christians in any sense of the word.

I understand I am not a good Catholic - precisely because being a good Catholic is extremely difficult. Being virtuous and free of sin is, for imperfect beings like humans, almost impossible. 

Which is the reason why I cannot fathom how anyone would ever be an evangelical. They bastardize everything, and they just pick whatever passages fit their agendas. It frankly makes quite nauseous, that things like ""Prosperity gospel"" exist, when Saint Martin shared part of his cloak with a beggar, and when Jesus chased the money lenders out of the temple.

So, how do US Catholics do it? Or is it so they the two religions seldom coexist, geographically speaking?

Thank you for your insight.",Catholicism

"Please tell me why this point of view about Christianity is wrong, I can't find any fallacies here and I'm worried",hereintransylvaniaaa,1625922761,"The Jews expected a Messiah to come, the Son of God. 

One time, around 30 AD, a man called Jesus started appearing in today's Israel. He thought that he is some kind of a prophet, someone with majestic wisdom, and that he has to tell it to others. That's where his lunacy has begun

He was a wise guy, had plenty of interesting stuff to tell. He gained popularity and followers, amongst them, the 12 apostles.

It's 33 AD. Jesus' lunacy went downhill, he started believing (due to his followers and popularity) that he is indeed the Messiah, the Son of God. And the followers believed it, too (because they were naive and just fascinated by him, the same reason why North Koreans are naive and fascinated by the Kim dynasty)

Jesus then died on the cross. His body was not there on Sunday because someone stole the body (not the apostles, maybe some thieves or fanatics). That's where the rumor started that Jesus woke up from the dead and was wandering around Jerusalem. Because, as the Bible says, Jesus was ""average looking"", they falsely assumed numerous people to be Jesus, which just supported the myth. 

Eventually, the apostles had a dream that he went to heaven. The resurrection has ended, and the apostles went to evangelize all the nations to tell them about that guy Jesus they knew. During that time, more and more myths were created about Jesus creating a hype around him, resulting in the New Testament. It's just like with Padre Pio right now: There is a hype around a super Saint who died like 50 years ago, there are lots of books released with lots of bs which didn't even happen in the first place. If I'd be about to create a Padre Pio Bible right now, 70% of what would be written would be bs which didn't even happen. But still people would buy it. The same thing was with Jesus 2000 years ago. Just a huge hype with a lot of myths and bs that didn't happen (like that he healed a blind person, or woke up from the dead a guy who was dead for 4 days already)

Then the Church was established and created, ""miracles"" were happening which seemed to confirm the Church. The miracles actually were just either some sort of auto-suggestion placebo (I believe that Jesus, Mary, Saints, whatever will heal me -&gt; Placebo effect takes place -&gt; I actually get ""kinda"" healed, a miracle), bs which was spread around the continent (like today's stories about Padre Pio) or just spontaneous healing they had no idea back then that it was possible (a paraplegic can re-learn to walk if the injury wasn't that severe, we know that, but back then maybe it was seen as a miracle when a paraplegic prayed to a Saint, and after some weeks he could move his legs a little bit and eventually ending up walking again)

And apparitions were just hallucinations, either because of the environment (like some gases floating around), or, most probably, some sort of psychosis or schizophrenia. People who had stigmata did it to themselves but didn't notice it because they were ""in trance"", people who didn't eat but the eucharist were just anorexic. 

And that's it!

How to deal with Anxiety/Constant worry as a Catholic?,CatholicHobbit1,1625918646,"How do other Catholics with diagnosed anxiety deal with it?  Jesus tells us not to worry but I can’t seem to stop

I have been diagnosed with general anxiety order by my doctor and right now we have been trying to manage it without medications, though I may start one in the future

I am someone who worries and imagines the worst case scenario regarding anything. It has been a blessing because it kept me out of jail/sins and successful in my studies and career, but it has also been a curse because I’m constantly stressed about earthly concerns and occasionally spiritual concerns.

Probably an incredibly dumb question.

Do you think that Catholic speakers are diminishing/trivializing men’s issues?,collegekid12316,1625902505,"I’ve found that many Catholic speakers tend to fall into American gender roles and present these roles as the natural essence of masculinity and femininity, but in reality, these roles have little to do with authentic masculinity/femininity. Masculinity is presented as being stoic, playing contact sports and knowing how to fix anything. Speakers implicitly put women on a pedestal, encouraging men to “be worthy of her”, commenting “she was so out of my league”, and disparaging male sexuality within marriage (a wife is entitled to be hurt when her husband rejects her sexual advances but her husband is wrong to desire sexual intimacy when she’s not in the mood): Finally, it is not seen as appropriate for a man to struggle with mental health issues, being the provider. Although most speakers are anti postmodern feminism (and rightly so), certain attitudes espoused, along with the Prince Charming trope presented in Hollywood, has contributed to a simp problem in young Christian men (who don’t seem to understand why the cute girl at church sees them only as a brother), and a false idealization of what a husband is actually called to do on the part of women (envisioning a husband as a Prince Charming figure instead of a Christ-like figure).

There was also a St. Andreas Wouters, a Dutch priests who was a serial womanizer and even fathered a few illegitimate children.

"Myself, a non-Catholic, asking for help to unlearn poisonous doctrines that Dispensationalism has planted in me. I ask only for wisdom.",Automaton17,1625880337,"Let me preface by saying, with deep desperation and sorrow, I have no right to request help from you as I have never participated in or advocated for the Catholic Church in my life. But I understand that you, as Catholics, draw great strength from the gospels and the non-pauline epistles, which is in great contrast to the Christian influence in my life right now. I do not bring forth these ideas to spread heresies, but to display them *as* heresies so that they can be dismantled as such. 

Those around me that read the Word push forth ideas like:

&gt; Paul is the Apostle to the gentiles as specifically appointed by God, and he must therefore be our primary source of wisdom concerning our salvation and sanctification (as the other Apostles were not for us but the Jews).

&gt; Jesus in his time on Earth was there only to fulfill the prophecies offer the Kingdom to Israel, and triumph over death. Therefore, most of if not all of Jesus's parables were in reference to the coming of a worldly, millennial Kingdom which he would rule directly over, and that we have been incorrectly infusing our own meaning into his parables.

&gt; The gentiles were not unified as joint heirs in Christ until Acts 9 at the conversation of Paul when the ""mystery"" was revealed to him that the gentiles would be included.

&gt; The other epistles (Hebrews through Jude) were written for Jews specifically, when Christ would return and put the world under the Law once again. Applying concepts like repentance, obedience, works, etc... from these epistles is brushed off because they were allegedly not written to us (the gentiles). For example: James was not written to us but to the Jews, ergo his his statements about ""works"" (James 2:17) directly contradicts Paul (Romans 3:28) and does not apply to us. 

&gt; When Stephen in Acts 7 was being killed and saw Jesus ""sitting on the right hand if God"", Jesus was ready to exact judgment on the world as described in Daniel 7:13-14. This was Israel's last chance to accept Jesus as the Messiah, and if they did Jesus would have brought judgement in that very moment and begun the Tribulation. At their denial, God began working the plan to incorporate the Gentiles.

&gt; If you believe there is any action required on your part to receive God's gift, you are putting yourself under the Law and do not understand Paul's gospel, the gospel of grace, well enough. (Belief is somehow not an action and is the only requirement to receive salvation)

&gt; God is so graceful that even the act of apostacy is not enough to override his grace and deny his gift of salvation.

&gt; Paul says ""faith OF God"" not ""faith IN God"" and therefore our faithfulness to him is unimportant to our salvation. HIS faith alone, everlasting and powerful, will carry us. 

&gt; King James only...

Again, these are concepts I wish to dispel, not to promote. There are many more, deep doctrinal issues that are hard to explain and grasp from the Dispensational community. 

But when I take moral wisdom from the gospels and Peter and James and even Hebrews, I'm often met with ""well you have to look at the context and see that those truths are for a different time"". It hurts me deeply to think that when years ago I had come to the realization I need a savior and read the gospel according to John and *wept* at its poetic truth, I was understanding it wrong? In my anxiety, I've read through Luke, Acts, the Peters, the Johns, Jude, and James in the last couple days and am in the middle of Hebrews right now. I'm having a really hard time, having absorbed those books in full beginning to end, understanding how they *couldnt* have been for us! I desperately need someone wiser than myself to help me. I need someone to tell me that the strength that I've gathered from those books is not a lie. The power to persevere and endure to the end, and the necessity to confess our sins to one another... The pain I'm experiencing is hard to describe.

Pray for me as I navigate through this mess of confusion. And if anyone can be a resource or can provide a resource for me to dispel these doctrines, please do so. Sorry for the long post, and thank you for reading.",Catholicism

Interactions with homeless people,bluemexico,1625854554,"Scenario (which happened recently):

I am walking downtown with my wife and three young children.

He asks/pleads for money, I kind of freak out a little bit because I am not sure what could potentially happen to my family during an interaction like this.

I want to emulate Jesus and assist the poor and vulnerable. I also want to protect my family. Is there a better way to handle these situations?

2) My situation/story: I'm a year out of high school (19 y/o) and feel lost school/career-wise. It seems like every school and company around where I live (Ontario, Canada) is quite secular. 

Almost all university &amp; colleges are anti-Christian as they come, and the promotion of gay/trans ideology is insane. Even seemingly innocent school activities like bingo nights are twisted like crazy, for example, the bingo awards for the school I was going to were Stag Shop gift cards (essentially a sex ""toy"" store). So as you may notice, I hate how my tuition literally goes to funding this left-wing anti-christian ideology. 

I am struggling to find a decent job that wouldn't require me to work on Sundays. And now many workplaces are going politically psycho. Even the supposedly ""catholic"" elementary schools are now ""celebrating"" pride and displaying the gay flag in schools.

I know of a few Catholic colleges/universities in Ontario, but they are really expensive and I don't want to take on tons of debt for something I am not even remotely sure about. Also, they usually mainly offer liberal arts degrees, which often don't pay the bills, plus I think I am more of a ""hands on"" kind of guy, but my interests are very broad.

I know that there are a few Catholic organizations, but most either are volunteer or have quite low pay I believe. I would like to work for them, but they simply wouldn't be able to financially support my (future) family that I want to have.

I was thinking of starting my own business, then at least I can make sure my business would be run with Christian values, and I could potentially hire fellow Catholics who are in a similar position. I don't really have an idea of what my business would be.

Porn,auzziesoceroo,1625853961,"Lads and ladettes, I'm here with a humble confession. I'm telling you this story in the hopes it can help even one person. I'm going to start from the very beginning so this will be long. Strap in. Its a barebones warts and all tale.

My first introduction to porn was when I was I pre-teen. The internet had just become a thing, I was 10 years old and I just started searching random stuff. Google wasn't even a thing back then so I can't even remember how I was searching these things. 

My parents quickly caught on to what I was doing and dad and I had ""the talk"". 

For the majority of my teenage years my ability to access porn and exposure to it was rather limited. My parents, with incredible foresight, refused to buy me a laptop and installed parental controls on the family laptop. During this time I went through extended periods of sobriety.

This all changed when I was able to buy my own laptop. In all.honesty, I did genuinely need it for my final two years of high school as it was at that time the world was starting to become truly online and access to the internet along with laptops in the class room were starting to become commonplace.

I struggled with varying success all through my late teens into my early twenties. There were rare periods of sobriety but on the whole I managed to keep my porn habit to two binges a week. The advent of tube sites (think YouTube for porn) did not help me at all. The binges tended to last about an hour (maybe 2)  but combined with tube sites I would.consume ever increasing amounts of porn in that one hour.

I met the woman of my dreams, got engaged, got married, graduated university, and had a kid.

The porn habit continued.

I tried a few different programs. I installed parental controls on my own laptop (I could always easily get around them). I even tried covenant eyes. Which would mean a daily report of my internet activity would be sent to my wife and I'd have to face her knowing she knew what I had been looking at that day. 

Eventually I stopped caring if she knew what I was doing.

As strange as if seems, outside of this aspect of my life, my wife and I were extremely affectionate with each other. I made sure to explain to her that the porn wasn't about her. It was a demon on my back I couldn't shake but it was in no way a reflection on her. 

To her everlasting credit, she believed me. She never cut herself off from me because of the porn. 

Eventually, we stop using covenant eyes. I tell her I'm actually getting better and it only hurts her to see my internet history when I stumble.

As I type this out the strength of her resolve weighs heavily on me. One of the readings at my wedding was Ecclesiasticus 26 ""happy the man who marries a virtuous women for his days.on earth will.be doubled"". Men, take note!

There was a long period when my spiritual life existed in a constant cycle.of two binges a week with confession on the weekend .

Then the covid lockdown happened.

I went from two binges a week to 3 binges.....per day.

Every day

Without fail

The fact confession wasn't available definitely made it worse.

Eventually, the lockdown eased and I was able to get to confession. Priests would tell me ""look this is bad but once you're able to go back in to the office and work normal hours I'm sure you'll be fine"". I was working from home at this time. My wife works in childcare so she was an exempt essential worker and was required to go in to work. 

The lockdown eventually eased a bit more and I was bake to go to work in the office but my habit continued.

I eventually stumble across John Doyle's video [porn](https://youtu.be/Vtp31feyTfM) where he laid down the challenge of ""if you're not addicted, then quit! Go 60 days without it!""

Over the next month I attempt the challenge. I fail, begin again, fail, begin again, fail,.begin again. I have an app called ReMojo which allows me to track my progress..Looking back on that month I was able to go a maximum of 36 hours without looking at porn and overall I was able to reduce my daily habit from 3 binges a day down to 2. 

This was the first time I ever acknowledged to myself that I was in serious trouble, that I had a problem and I needed external help ASAP. 

I was a little despondent as all the usual avenues weren't helping. Devotion to Mary or St Joseph? I had that. Frequent recourse to the Sacramento? Yep, that too.

Fortunately for me  God had recently put in my path an older man who had recently become a good friend of mine. He was a partner at law firm, not a Catholic, a blunt, conservative, direct individual. 

Over dinner one night He used to smoke like a chimney but was able to quit at the drop of a hat due to hypnotherapy!

A light bulb went off in my head.

I am cradle practising Catholic, conservative (at least by Australian standards),  pragmatic bordering on cynical, and educated (law commerce double major) and I'm here to tell.you one thing......

It works!

I had two sessions. Second session was two weeks ago and I havent looked at porn since. I have barely even felt the urge to look.at it either! My usual.triggers for porn were being either bored or tired.  Now when I get bored or tired I look up BJJ instructional videos!

I feel.....normal.....it's not like I've entered the matrix or anythig like that but my previous desire to look at porn is just....deleted! I still get bored and tired, I just don't look at porn anymore. Aside from BJJ, I am focusing on my other hobies such as home made beer, HEMA, and I'm looking at starting my own business.

I'm going to end it here because it's late and I'm sleepy but I hope this helps.

"Catholicism and the LGBTQ+ Community: Thoughts on ""Building a Bridge"" by Father James Martin",Mister_Pippin_Sir,1625852782,"Hello all,

First time writing on this sub. A bit of background: I am a former Catholic but have been out of the Church for around 10 years now, same with my sibling. I realize that now makes my perspective on what's being talked about in Catholic circles a bit dated. Both of my parents are practicing Catholics, and there has been some tension over my sibling's sexuality and gender identity since they came out (over 10 years ago as bisexual, almost 8 years ago as nonbinary). No full-on rejection, but there is frustration on both sides (parents and sibling) about the other's difficulty in accepting the other's perspective. Important to mention that I am based in the US.

Recently my mom let me borrow the book ""Building a Bridge"" by Fr. James Martin, SJ. Father Martin proposes suggestions for how the Church and the LGBTQ+ community can come together with Respect, Compassion, and Sensitivity. He does not attempt to reconcile the opposed views of the Catholic Church and the LGBTQ+ community toward same-sex intimacy, instead focusing on areas in which common ground can be reasonably built between the two communities at this time. He is explicit in stating that while both sides can improve in their approach toward the other, the Church bears the primary responsibility in building common ground with the LGBTQ+ community. I appreciated the read and thought it was a welcome perspective, but I can't help but feel based on my experiences that Fr. Martin must be an outlier in his views. Have any practicing Catholics (queer or cisgender/heterosexual) read this book? If so, what were your thoughts? Do you think Fr. Martin's perspective is representative of the beliefs of you and other Catholics you know? If not, do you think building a bridge with the LGBTQ+ community is something you and other Catholics you know would be open to? Why or why not? Are there any qualifiers that might make you say 'yes' or 'no'? Like I mentioned, it has been a decade since I've been involved with Church groups and I do not want to base my assumptions on what I heard 10 years ago. Please be honest in your responses even if you think they may not be well-received--I am truly here to get as honest a perspective as I can (admittedly while on Reddit 😁) on what Catholics in 2021 have to say about this subject.",Catholicism

I questioned how just it is for the church to deny gay people what I'm freely able to have in a romantic relationship. But whenever I bring it up people just jump to ""You aren't defined by your urges or tendencies!"" ""So many gay people live inside the church and you can too!"" Like what the hell. Is having empathy for the plight of gay people and questioning the church's stance only reserved for people in the church with SSA? It drives me nuts that people can't wrap their heads around a straight person having doubts or struggling with that teaching.

I don't want this to turn into a theological debate, but jumping to conclusions about people that are struggling with a church teaching because of how it impacts others isn't okay",Catholicism
Self-Flagellation Vs. BDSM ; What is and isn't okay?,Teburninator,1625852259,"Hi all. In my quest to better understand what healthy relationship is and isn't I've come across a troubling issue I need clarified. As I understand it, our bodies are temples and we are to take care of them. To me, pain is an indication of something happening or has happened that isn't good for the body. Therefore, wherever pain is occurring we should endeavour to minimize/reduce it or heal it altogether. 

I'm told that BDSM is an acceptable and healthy form of a relationship. In my heart, I want this to be wrong. I want to believe it is evil and perverse. I have friends and colleagues whom differ. They contend that it is consensual and healthy because it is exploring our humanity and feels good. I contend it is demeaning to our nature as humans born with dignity and hurts our bodies (attaching pleasure to pain, humiliation, hurting perfectly good body parts, etc.)

I had a thought come across and it filled me with dread. I remember when St. John Paul II would self-flagellate to submit his body to Christ more perfectly. This is damaging to his body and in a weird way causes connecting pleasure (pleasing God) with pain.

While writing this I also thought about working out (ripping muscles, hurt from recovery, etc.) and how we voluntarily go into it with the purpose of getting stronger, looking better, being healthier, etc. 

So is it the intention that is the issue? Am I wrong for thinking BDSM is demonic in a way? I'm keeping in mind that the contemporary BDSM definition (aka 50 shades of grey which I haven't investigated) may not be akin to ""a healthier version"" of consent/no leaving marks.

I find this so disturbing I want it to be wrong but I need to know without a shadow of a doubt it is. It doesn't matter what I think, what does the Church think?

Should it also be avoided because of the near occasion of sin?
Are we to always look after our bodies healthily? Does that mean not ever eating unhealthily? What are the boundaries!?

[Free Friday][Rant] My extended Catholic family/in-laws are extremely anti-vax and not afraid to say some fairly hateful things regarding mine and my wife's decision to vaccinate.,Wagglyfawn,1625850389,"They live in Canada and we live in the States. My wife immigrated here 10 years ago shortly after we got married. I've always considered it a blessing that we could still drive an hour and see my wife's family and they could see our children over the years. Obviously that's been difficult since covid happened.  
  
In early spring of this year, my wife and I jumped at the opportunity to get our covid vaccines because we suspected it would eventually make border crossing easier (not to mention we just support getting vaccinated anyway). Even knowing that, her family is VERY openly against that decision while simultaneously telling us how much they've missed our family the past year. Among other things they say and do, it's been really putting me on edge for a while now. 
  
I hate to say it, but every day I feel more and more like I don't even want to see them anymore once things go back to normal. I'm about ready to snap and just tell them they can cross the damn border themselves (they almost never did in the past 10 years) if they want to try and see us.

Encouragement to a new catholic,theotokosprayforus,1625842211,"I was confirmed this week! Glory to God! 

Sometimes I feel lonely in my journey to Christ. My Christian friends are a mix of prosperity gospel Christians or new agey Christians, and some who just have a general distrust of Catholicism (I try to avoid these conversations but sometimes they just pop up). 

My parents are very anti-catholic Protestants (former Catholics too) and are very disappointed in my conversion. 

I have two catholic friends, but one of them stopped going to mass regularly and I’m not sure what happened. 

My husband is very non-religious so I never share about my spiritual life with him cause it usually just leads to arguments. 

My conversion was quite literally overnight after I experienced a vision from Christ. I went from a radical Marxist feminist to a Jesus freak after this one experience. 

Having your worldview change so drastically can be a little difficult. I find that I can’t watch/read most mainstream entertainment anymore because the messages in most media is very contrary to the gospel, and it makes me genuinely uncomfortable. I find that I don’t relate to a lot of people in my life anymore and that my goals in life have also changed. I’m going to do my masters this September, but I’m not sure what God’s will is in my life. I would love to be a housewife with lots of kids, serving at my parish often but my husband doesn’t want that. He wants me to have a high paying job after I finish my masters. 

Anyway I’m still trying to figure what God’s will in my life is. I pray every single day for the conversion of my loved ones, and I need more patience from God and have hope that He can change their hearts like He changed mine.",Catholicism

*This is just a line of thought I’ve been having recently. I’m not using it as an excuse to blow off the pursuit of holiness and dismiss perseverance.

Training myself not to use the Lord's name in vain?,Redstarshard,1625800462,"(context: im thirteen)

One day, out of the blue, I randomly accidently said Goddamn it while I was angry. I didn't mean to, and I've never been around anyone who has said it, it just kind of burst out of my mouth which really surprised me because...I've never been around anyone or anything that's made me say it.

Now, I had a problem in the past, accidently using Jesus's name in vain but somehow I quit doing that (I think I went to confession and, even though I was doing it unintentionally, I quit it miraculously).

But now, I'm pretty confident I'm not committing a mortal sin because of my intentions, and I try not to and it has gotten better, but it's become a habit. I've been keeping a rubber band around my wrist and launching it into my wrist (idk how to explain it) when it does happen but I still haven't quit doing it.

Any advice to quit sinning and to change this habit? I've tried using other terms but it still happens.",Catholicism

My wife barely even wants to go with me, and a main factor is because she doesn't see anyone else our age engaged in their Faith, she is very lukewarm so going to Church every Sunday to be around 60, 70 and 80 year olds singing those typical 80's/90's church songs isn't that appealing to her.

Is it good to tempt yourself with something that is not necessarily sinful and try to resist it?,ProLifeCatholic1535,1625796794,"One thing that a Priest mentioned to me recently in confession is that I need to practice restraint and gain more will power, and a good way to do this is to sacrifice something every day and stick to it. 

I was wondering if a good way to practice will power would be to tempt myself with something (not sinful) that I've given up for the day and try to resist it?


For example, today I gave up sweets. Sweets are not sinful, but I gave them up today as a sacrifice and to practice willpower. I had a bag of candy right next to my desk all day, which was incredibly tempting, but I didn't eat any of it.

This got me thinking: Would this be a good thing to do more of? Intentionally tempting myself with something I've given up for the day? And practicing willpower by refusing it? Like, if I give up sweets again, should I keep candy next to me all day?",Catholicism

Question regarding last rites for someone who passed,Shatmander,1625792943,"Hey All,

I'll keep it brief. I had a family member who passed away and entrusted me with their remains. They passed extremely suddenly, so didn't have anyone to give them their last rites. I'm not super religious so this stuff isn't too clear to me. Is there any way I could have a priest bless the remains before they find their final resting place? I know when my mother passed we had her remains blessed during the funeral (she had her last rites read while alive as well), but this person requested there be no funeral and I'm honoring that.

Would it be understandable to go to their church and ask a Priest to give them a final blessing? If so, how should I go about doing so, set up an appointment?

I prayed to Saints for the 1st time,atadbitcatobsessed,1625779681,"Hi friends,

Last night my husband and I found a stray kitten who looked very weak and sick. He could barely walk, and barely had the energy to eat/drink what we gave him. But it was too late to call anyone for help. We didn't know if he would make it through the night. Anyways, we did what we could and decided to call animal control in the morning to ask where we can take him for help. 

That night, I prayed to God that this poor little kitty would make it if it's in his plan. But since I have been researching Catholicism lately, for the 1st time, I decided to ask a couple animal-loving saints for assistance as well. So I also prayed to St. Francis and St. Gertrude. Growing up protestant, praying to saints is something very foreign to me. And I know that if it wasn't in God's plan for the cat to make it, that it wouldn't live. But there was something extra comforting about asking the saints for assistance in this scenario.

The next morning, the kitten was still alive. So we made some calls and found an animal hospital with a ""Good Samaritan"" program, where you can drop off a stray and they'll provide care for free. Then if the animal lives, they transfer it to a local aninal shelter to find a ""furrever"" home. When we dropped him off, a vet tech immediately took him for emergency care. But I wasn't too emotional when they took him away because despite how weak he looked, I had a sense that he was going to make it. 

Any more prayers are appreciated. If he lives, I am sure he will make a family very happy. Cats brings so much joy to a home.🙏 Also, this experience has made me more eager to explore the Catholic faith more.",Catholicism

Is consecrated virginity morally superior to married life?,dhammapada186,1625776791,"I've read several moral theologians asserting that consecrated virginity is ""more perfect"". If they mean that it's morally superior, I find it particularly absurd and hypocritical, as long as whoever says it is married (Pieper, for example). 

Some may argue that it is indeed morally superior, but not everybody has the same ""call"" to it. I answer that if it's indeed morally superior, everybody with no exception is called to it.

The only way out of this dilemma is, in my opinion, to assert the legitimacy of both kind of lives, never asserting the moral superiority of one over another.

The irony in all this is that they were the same people who were encouraging my country to take in more illegal African immigrants. These illegal immigrants are mostly Muslims and I have been seeing a disturbing shift in our society. 

I have never heard of a case of a Catholic forcing his / her belief onto others using violence. But this is what these Muslims are doing in Europe. The European Union we were all so proud of - because it emerged as a peaceful brotherhood after WW2 - has been taken over by people of a very alien culture. But culture is not the problem.

Is respecting your non-Catholic family disrespecting God?,mew_t00,1625767597,"My dad is unfortunately the type of Protestant who is extremely skeptical of religious institutions with a visible hierarchy. Therefore, he is very anti-Catholic and refuses to allow me to go to Mass (until I leave in 2 months), make the Sign of the Cross in front of the family, even pray for him (bc he thinks we worship different God), etc. He has threatened to disown me if I practice the religion in front of him, just saying “do it yourself privately in your room or out of my house”. This really angers me, but I didn’t think it was a sin listening to this until I heard a traditionalist Catholic tell me what I’m doing is a sin. I just pray privately, make the Sign under the table in dinner, not talk about God to my dad, etc yet I cannot understand how this is a “sin” or disrespecting God. Radical traditionalists tell me I’m compromising God by falling victim to human respect and choosing creature over creator.. I’ve been feeling extremely guilty as of late because of the lectures and some trads telling (in the past) that me practicing my faith secretly and not publicly criticizing my dad is “disrespect” and blasphemy. 

The only time I vow to not respect my dad is he tells me to reject Catholicism in front of his face. I was an inch from being disowned a few weeks ago because I told my dad that I will never deny Catholicism for his own personal human feelings. However, I feel like some traditionalists take it too far. If I am wrong, then I will correct myself to please God through his grace; however, I always get more confused talking to traditionalist Catholics about the faith than feeling more enlightened (?). 

Also, I am confused about when to draw the line of being a victim to creatures over submission to God’s will. Some radical traditionalists say its a sin to be friends with secular people because by being friends with them you are “supporting them” even if you don’t accept their lifestyle.

Some Questions.,Crockmann,1625765616,"Hello. To whomever this may concern, I have no idea if this kind of post is allowed, but I hope it is, considering that I’ve found myself in quite the spiritual conundrum.
I was raised Roman Catholic in my youth, but never baptized, something of which I understand is highly blasphemous. In my life religiously and spiritually, despite my best efforts, have been in turmoil, which led to a prolonged period of atheism turned pantheism. Said beliefs are illogical and unfulfilling, and I gradually turned to agnostic theism. Philosophically (philosophy is something I’m very passionate in) i’ve always looked towards a pessimistic view of man, and probably always will (Giambattista Vico influences my thought greatly). I have looked into Roman Catholicism once again and I am convinced it is the most believable (besides Eastern Orthodoxy but that comes later) faiths. However, I have some important questions.

1. How do Catholics navigate the legacy of something as complicated as Vatican II? I’m aware of how complicated that is but I don’t really have a real opinion on it.
2. What necessarily makes Roman Catholicism more legitimate than Eastern Orthodoxy? I want to look into both religions, and although the Roman Catholic Church seems more sound historically and theologically, Orthodoxy has a mysterious appeal. 
3. Despite various coincidences and what not, what other solid evidence exists for the Christian and Catholic faiths? I’m aware of the ancient kingdoms such as Samaria and Judah, but what other evidence exists?
4. What Catholic youtubers would someone recommend to watch? The only ones I’m really aware of are Classical Theism, Pints with Aquinas and Elijah Yasi.
If you’ve read this far, thank you, I want to open up my views and see if the catholic faith is valid, and if the Christian faith is valid, thank you.",Catholicism

Prayers for the souls in Purgatory,Dependent-Summer2043,1625764698,"Ive been feeling a certain way the past couple of days about souls that have passed on and are in purgatory. It's really been making me sad thinking of the suffering theyre enduring. I know they accept it, but I've been in so many situations in my life where I've felt stuck and forced to sit in the consequences of my actions. It really is painful, and I can't imagine the pain they're going through.

I left the church pretty young and came back early this year. Part of what lead me astray was my interest in the paranormal. I wanted to help spirits who were stuck (which took a turn into occult eventually). I've been learning maybe that praying for those souls is something I'm should have been focusing on all along. I started adding in a chaplet of divine mercy and a chaplet of st Gertrude daily for them. I'm trying to offer up communion for them too. As I've been going through this, its made me feel more passionate about trying to offer things to them to help them because they cant help themselves.

How many of our ancestors are stuck there? How many loved ones? How many people that are forgotten because of how much time has passed that people who personally knew them just don't exist anymore? Or the people who simply have no one praying for them? A lot of us tend to be so focused on our lives/our needs or the needs of those close to us, we forget about them. We might end up there someday and eventually be forgotten by the world as well.

I'm only one person, and I can only offer so much myself. So, the point of this post is to extend an invitation to join me in picking one devotion each day to offer for them, the souls that have no one to pray for them and are in need of prayers. For the next week, 10 days, month, whatever you think you can do. I hope others join me :).",Catholicism

His personality and looks is literally everything I prayed for from God! So I'm grateful to have met a man like him. 
But, I'm so far behind in my own faith that I feel inadequate.
When I see him participate in his church, I feel like an outsider looking in on catholicism. It feels alien to me. Like everything is new to me, never seen before. Which isn't true. 
I think it's his passion. I've never met anyone passionate like him to know and learn and preach the right thing. He's a lover of learning. 
For me, if I prayed with others, I'd feel out of my comfort zone. I'm scared to embrace faith with others. 
He's so passionate, that i'm starting to get scared of it. It's more comfortable for me to sit in a park with a few beers and a joint with some friends than to pray the rosary that I still don't know off by heart.  
I feel so embarrassed by this lack of faith. My relationship with God is like my relationships with anyone else, I'm incredibly distant, in denial, scared of being hurt, so I avoid getting to know the person.

Additionally, I was raised Baptist and now consider myself more non-denominational, but I am comfortable with doing the kneeling and the sign of the cross, etc. if I should, but I’m wondering if I *should*. Obviously I’ll stand and sit and kneel, but should I say and do the other pieces? I know I am not in a place to participate in the communion since I’m not Catholic. Another friend in the party is Pagan, so I’m guessing she’s just going to stand/sit/kneel and not do much of anything else, which means I won’t feel totally out of place in the party if I don’t (or shouldn’t) do certain things.

“To safeguard in every possible way the dignity of so august a Sacrament, not only is the power of its administration entrusted exclusively to priests, but the Church has also prohibited by law any but consecrated persons, unless some case of great necessity intervene, to dare handle or touch the sacred vessels, the linen, or other instruments necessary to its completion.”",Catholicism

I would like to be — I think I will be, without undue delay, as it becomes clearer to me the path I’m walking. But what I need to hear is that I’m not doing anything wrong. If I die tomorrow, I will not be accused of — pardon the modern vulgarity of the comparison — stealing valor. I need assurance that I’m on the right path and I can love and enjoy the path itself, without getting hamstrung on the future.

Thank you. God bless.",Catholicism

Where/how to start reading the writings of the early church fathers?,boy_beauty,1625701353,"I'm currently reading Brant Pitre's *The Case for Jesus*, and came across this section:

&gt; For most of my life, I never knew there were early Christian writings besides those in the New Testament. These were written by ancient Christian leaders who lived (for the most part) after the lifetime of the apostles,and who came to be known as the early “church fathers.” The church fathers provide us a fascinating window into the Christian world of the first several centuries AD. My goal at the time was to learn what they had to say about the origins and authorship of the four Gospels. Having heard and believed for years that “we do not know who wrote the Gospels,” I naturally assumed that the early church fathers would either not have much to say about the matter or that they would be as vague and agnostic as the modern scholars I was reading at the time. I was completely unprepared for what I discovered. As I quickly learned, the earliest Christian writings outside of the New Testament are completely unambiguous and totally unanimous about who wrote the four Gospels. Even more, some of these writings come from authors who either knew the apostles themselves, or who were only one generation removed from the apostles.

Now my interest is piqued, but I have no clue where to start, who to start with, who even the early fathers *are*. What texts do you recommend to start with?",Catholicism

Confused,MT1619,1625697411,So recently I have been really confused in terms of my spiritual life. I have been falling into mortal sin. I missed Mass this Sunday because I was out partying and have fallen into more sins since. Many things make me skeptical of the Catholic Church. Like why would a good God allow people to send themselves to hell for all eternity? Why does a temporary action deserve an eternal punishment? If you’re Catholic then you believe that he is all knowing and almighty. If you’re Catholic you believe that that God created us as his prized possession over the angels because he died for our sins. John 3:16 refers to God loving the world specifically and doesn’t mention any extraterrestrial life. Why can God’s creation imagine creatures who are more advanced than the creatures that God created. Why does God confine himself to a Church run by sinful men. Why does God confine his primary revelation to a book written thousands of years ago by men without same understanding and advancement that we have today. Why does God create everyone but only choose some to get to heaven. Why does God allow evil? All these questions remained unanswered and I’m tired of people saying “it’s a mystery” I don’t know but if anyone can help me that would be great,Catholicism

My oldest is 2. Every non-Catholic I know thinks this is the height of insanity. The conversation is *always* awkward. Sometimes they’re offended. Sometimes they make excuses for why they only had one or two. Sometimes they’re passive aggressive or mocking. Sometimes they wax poetic about how much they love birth control and vasectomies. Sometimes they ask leading questions, trying to figure out how much money my husband makes. *Always* awkward. 

Everyone at church was thrilled, telling us how blessed we are. Everyone else has offered pity and condolences. They lower their voice, make a 😬 face, and ask, “Was this planned?” Usually I just shrug and say we’re Catholic. When they ask if we’re done after this one, I have to tell them probably not. Then the expressions change to 😳😠

Our bar for “large family” is much higher than normal people. Every Sunday, most Catholics see at least one family with at least 5 children. We have 3 families in Sprinter vans. Three kids doesn’t seem that crazy to me, but in a country where the birth rate is dipping below two for most demographics, having more than two is an extremist decision. You don’t often have theological or moral discussions with others, but the number of children you have is an extremely visible marker that we’re a church called to run against modern culture. We’re called to live differently, with a more radical faith. Other religious groups oppose gay marriage, abortion, promiscuity, and sins of the flesh. Contraception, not so much. We are backwards oddballs for opposing birth control and viewing children as blessings, not burdens. So grateful for this community and the other Catholic pockets on Reddit.

Recently, I went through a massive spiritual upheaval and I’ve decided to go through conversion. I’ve already started my involvement in the church and have met wonderful, loving people through the help of the priests. 

One of the girls I was speaking to, and I went to mass with her for the first time, told me she was excited to hear my story because I’ve done a massive leap of faith. The other girls in the group agreed. And this, scared me a little because—

I was an extremely involved witch. You name it, I probably dealt with it. I experienced many dark, terrifying things that I do not wish on anyone. 

Majority of the people I’ve met through the church were “Cradle Catholics” (I’ve heard the term a couple of times!) or converts from other Christian denominations. I’ve found a lot of peace through my new way of life and I’ve found deeper love for myself and others as a result. I’m still learning every day about how to have faith. 

I don’t want people to be afraid of me or judge me, even though that sounds dumb. But I don’t want to lie either. It’s more so my own fears above all else. The priests told me I wasn’t alone but I’m still a little nervous.

Questions about a non-Catholic marrying a Catholic,Ouwyn,1625672083,"Hello everyone, 

Just wanted to ask a somewhat simple question.  My girlfriend have been dating for a while now and are discussing marriage. She is Catholic and wants to get marriage at her church by her priest. I am completely ok with this even though I do not currently identify with any sort of religion. During or conversations on the topic she mentioned that I as a non-Catholic would have to get permissions for the church or something like that in order to marry her or something like that. This is new territory for both of us so we both are not sure how this works since this would be her first marriage and I have never married a Catholic.  So my question is as a non-Catholic is there any sort of study I would have to do or permissions I would have to seek in order to marry my GF in her church or are we both just over thinking it.

For clarification, she is from Vietnam and practices whatever the most common form of Catholicism is from there (I tried to ask her which one but even she was not sure). I was raised as Christian and was baptized in a church but have not practiced religions in many years.",Catholicism

I found St. Michael cleared away the evil presences in an instant - again it is hard to describe but If I can use old imagery it felt as if he was clearing a swathe for a righteous path for me with his fiery sword.

This is the prayer: 

 Sancte Michael Archangele, defende nos in proelio, contra nequitiam et  insidias diaboli esto praesidium.

Question about the first prayer,Matthew-Robinson,1625654297,"Hi I’m a new believer of Catholicism. I was initially ordained into the Baptist Church by a pastor I knew. He used to come to my house every Saturday to talk with me about my life and read the Bible together. He did it for about two years. 

Looking back I feel sorry for having made him wait too much, but he kept waiting for me to come to church when I would feel comfortable and more confident to do so. I ended up only going once or twice on Christmas. The main reason I didn’t want to go was because I was extremely anti-social and I couldn’t bear being surrounded by kids of the same age as me. I only talked to a few adults outside of the church from time to time. 

One day he seemed to have trouble waiting for any longer, and I fully understand him now, led me to pray together to Jesus to be received as his son. I don’t know if that was the formal ordination for entering the church, but I still did what he told me and met with him for a few more months.

Obviously this happened several years ago and I don’t contact him any longer. He would probably be surprised to find out I attend mass now every week, voluntarily, from my free-will. 

Sorry for talking too much unnecessary things, but is this considered an entry into the Baptist Church and if so, do I have to go through a different process from RCIA because I had previously been a member of a different church? Or can I just continue as a newcomer with no prior knowledge of Christianity? Believe me I only attended the church a few times and I regret to say never fully had faith in it.

What is an idol and what is worship?,Arcane_Ronin,1625650228,"I am currently looking into the RCC and EOC and considering joining one of them because I desire to connect to traditional christianity. Of course, the Church has added a number of things through time (liturgy, canons, theological resolutions, etc) and because of that there have been schisms. For that reason, I am seeking answers and different takes on different issues because I have to take a side.

Now, 

I want to ask specifically about Idolatry because I feel I dont quite understand the answers provided in other sources such as ""Catholic Answers"". And I also want to see what different catholics think about it. 

The dictionary definition of Idolatry is: 
""an image or representation of a god used as an object of worship.""

Is that not what is done in the Catholic Church? 

I love religious images and I can see that there is nothing wrong with having them in the place of worship as the same was done in the Tabernacle and the Temple. However, having worship directed or channeled through the statues (or icons) seem to be Idolatry. 

In connection to this question, I must also ask: what is worship exactly?

I know Catholics separate veneration from adoration but I do not understand what the difference is in practice. 

How do you practice adoration instead of veneration?

In Scripture we see that something as simple ad bowing down to statues was considered adoration.

Haven’t really gotten an answer on superstition,Gjak_Illir,1625631243,"To preface this, I come from a culture rife with superstition. I recognize much of it to be rooted in the occult and avoid it like the plague (such as the evil eye and telling fortunes via coffee grounds) but what is bothering me now are the apparent “valid” superstitions, or at least what I thought were superstitions contrary to the faith 

I do believe in the supernatural in the sense of our faith, and also in the sense that we’re warned about the demons throughout the Bible and faith 

But now I’m learning that apparently some superstitions which I completely disregarded are apparently legitimate and are not contrary to the faith, more so that we have to believe in them to be mindful? I am basing these “superstitions” off of spiritual warfare talks by Roman Catholic priest Fr Ripperger who is an exorcist 

I am talking about physical objects being cursed, working curses and hexes placed by other humans, and legitimate spells that witches use (who apparently do have supernatural abilities through the nefarious??)

A relevant example - in my culture there is a deep rooted belief in witches and whenever someone suspects someone of engaging in witchcraft, they never accept anything from them including food or water. Is this now valid and a part of the faith? Having I been dangerously wrong in disregarding all supernatural claims inflicted by humans?

A while back, I was given an excerpt of C.S. Lewis’s essay, “The World’s Last Night.” The work in general discusses what the title entails: the last night before the End Times, the Second Coming of Christ. 

In wrestling with the question of “when?” with regards to the Second Coming, Lewis discusses Matthew 24:34:

&gt; Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.

Lewis sidesteps a lot of apologetics and theological debates on the meaning of this statement and just asks bluntly: “What if Jesus was wrong?” He argues that Christ was not omniscient while on this earth, and while he spoke honestly and assertively about the Second Coming, perhaps he was wrong about it happening within “this generation.”

Newly confirmed Catholic dad who needs advice on how to better parent and parenting with a unbelieving progressive mother (we are not together),d_jango_fett,1625614850,"Peace to you brothers and sisters

As the title states, I am newly confirmed as of a week ago, prior to this I was a evangelical minister who fail to the wayside and waded through Atheism, agnosticism, other spiritual traditions, Islam, and finally to the Church of Christ (Catholic church). During my atheistic stint I abused alcohol, met a fellow unbeliever and produced a child with her after a few months. I was inebriated for much of that relationship and I don't remember much of it. She lives in Florida I live in MD. I do not have any custodial arrangements.
A tiny introduction of myself: I likely have PTSD due to my upbringing and some adulthood events, due to this I tend to bottle things up when I am mistreated and then have aggressive communication methods, thus I avoid communicating as much as possible--I realize this is not as healthy as it ought to be. Through the blessed sacrament of confession and my own personal work with the Lord I am slowly becoming better, my heart is softening, I am producing the fruits of the Spirit. But I still have physiological reactions to duress, and at this juncture of our relationship or non relationship, even hearing her voice or seeing a text from her is triggering.
Back to the relationship. I may be wrong but I believe her to be a narcissist or some cluster b type personality. I have endured parental alienation (PAS), passive aggressive maneuvering through my child: she slept with a young man when she was pregnant and then invited that same person to the hospital after her delivery, and then asked him if he wanted to hold my child. He thankfully said no, but that may be the most disrespectful thing that has occurred to me in my life. There clearly is on her end, a desire to be loved by another human and to be the one loved the most. To that end she molds him to see her as the best, even so much as tauntingly asking him ""who do you love more mommy or daddy?"" or texting me that he loves his mommy (which is good to me because my mother was abusive, I just don't want my son to have a codependent relationship with his mother).
I have my son for the rest of the summer. Whenever she calls she consistently asks him if he's watched Moana, Frozen 1 and 2, almost the first things brought up, and actually said ""I am disappointed in you"" when he remarked that he had not yet, albeit in a quasi-facetious manner. Maybe I am reading too much into this behavior, but from my discernment (and I think I'm fairly good at discerning), it appears to me like she is coaxing him into having a progressive feministic worldview, where gender is fluid and by implication, culture is oppressive. This grates me.
On my end, admittedly I have not been as involved as I would love. I have sent financial support every month since birth, visited him, and gotten him for at least a month or and a half of the summer, except for 2020. I do call but there have been times where her and her BF talk so loud in the background that I was unable to hear my child and when I attempted to address that and ask for privacy or schedule time for a call; she refused and was dismissive. I basically grey stone her and rarely engage in any discourse with her and I keep everything through text messaging.
If you've made it this far I appreciate it here is what I am seeking:

What books, resources, counsel is there that will better help me coparent/parallel parent.

In what ways do I need to correct my own thinking?

How do I help instill faith in my son without worrying about her undermining it completely or even teaching him the contrary? He is in a christian daycare-school, but I would not put it past her to talk negatively about my faith to spite me. (She is not a believer)

Prayers to overcome fear. I am afraid of conflict with my son's mom. I am afraid of my child being used as a pawn and turned against me. I am afraid of being mistreated. But mostly I am afraid he will turn out without a deep love for God.

Should I take her to court? I feel like the benefits are many because there is a third party and I'd have some say, which is a large part of my stress, feeling powerless and her violating boundaries whenever she can. However, I don't want to stir up the hornets nest and scorn her to the point where she then triples down on her tactics due to feeling a loss of control.

Any advice/suggestions that would help.


TLDR: I'd appreciate any advice in how to coparent with my sons mom who is a possible narcissist/borderline unbeliever; they live in Florida and I in MD.
Why not move to Florida? I am currently slated to take care of my father who has Alzheimer's, I live in our childhood house currently. It was best for him to move near family in Texas (I was unstable at the time) but now that I am in my right mind and being lead by the Spirit, I am able to love and care for him. Prior to this, I simply didn't move to Florida because I did not want to be around her or at her mercy or tactics; I didn't trust my ability to maintain cool sensibility with the myriad of arrows fired my way.",Catholicism

When I was a protestant I was always being engage by them to randomly to be evangilised or join their church and i would always see their branding every where but with the Catholic church they expect people to just come to them.  even the mormons and johovans witness are known more for going out and trying to evangilise than the Catholic Church who is the real Church of Christ does.  I look back and every Catholic event i went to was because it was being advertised to me in a already Catholic setting i was al ready in and all the people there were already Catholics there was never anyone new just wanting to learn or was invited.  With all the money that go to so many Catholic Charities and The Church weekly and a big issue in the decline in the faith in the Church while these Mega protestant Churchs are flourishing, why dont i see more of an attempt to reach people outside of the already saved.  It seems like the US Church leaders is severly lacking in its approach to save souls and evangalism by sitting on the sideline and waiting for the next generation to just come to them to be saved and have become complacient or afraid of the challenge to engage outside status quo approaches",Catholicism

A question about condom use in a specific scenario,Ok_Elk_5095,1625599486,"Greetings! I am a medical student, and while I fully understand and agree with the Church's stance on sexual matters, especially after studying STDs and other problems that may affect people who engage in certain unconventional practices, there's a specific case which boggles my mind.

I know condoms are used to halt or at least reduce the chance of reproduction, which goes against one aspect of the the nature of sex (generating offspring). However, condoms may also be used to prevent STDs. I know couples are only supposed to have sex after marriage, but what if someone's spouse knowingly has an STD (like HIV) and yet still wants to have children? Would the use of condoms still be unlawful? I am inclined to think it wouldn't, because his aim is only to protect himself from an infection. The reduced chances of having children is merely an accidental consequence of an arguably necessary action in this case.

I would like to know what you think or know regarding this scenario. Thanks in advance.",Catholicism

But ever since attending TLM, my view on NO has become negative. It’s like my bar has been set high and NO doesn’t seem to be meeting the standards. 

For example, just last Sunday, the lector and the priest were not in sync with the lector accidentally reading her lines before the right time. Or the laity mumbling the Responsorial Psalm. Or the noisy Sign of Peace. The priest also had his phone on him and even had it out when walking to the ambo. Some of the laity were wearing inappropriate clothing with one young woman wearing a skirt above the knee. A year ago, there even was a woman who wore a crop top, enough to see her cleavage. 

I see the Novus Ordo as a valid form but the lack of reverence and too much participation of the laity that makes everything look disorganized irritate me so much.

However, I’m the only one in my family who attends the TLM and I don’t wanna leave the NO because I still want to spend time with my family.

"Is it a mortal sin to disagree with the church on Homosexuality, BUT not love that lifestyle or promote it?",bobthe_purple_cat,1625584965,"Hey, all! Despite what the title might lead you to think, I am not gay. I am married to a wife and have two kids. I have been raised in Catholicism my whole life, as has my wife. 

Currently I've been struggling with he church on certain things: Homosexuality and Birth Control (specifically condoms). 

Homosexuality: As stated above, I am not gay. I do not struggle with homosexual desires at all. I have a sister in law who is a lesbian (has left the church or her own will) so I come in contact with a secular perspective on this often. I do not know any gay Catholics (that I am aware of...).

I personally do not believe the church's teaching on homosexuality. The only person who knows this is my wife, and she shares a similar view. However, we do not go around telling anyone this (Catholic or non-Catholic). I am aware of the church's teaching on this, and even though I don't believe it, I understand the Church's position and don't encourage others to go against it. No one actually knows my position (again, besides my wife).

Condoms: the same reasoning as given above, I know the church's teaching but do not agree with it. Wife has a similar viewpoint. We don't use condoms or anything, as we are trying to remain faithful even though it's hard in this circumstance. Again, no one knows ours views, just us. 

My question is this... Is it sinful to PERSONALLY have problems with Church teaching or even reject them, even IF you are not actually commiting said sins? 

I.e. I don't think homosexuality is wrong, but I don't go around trying to convince everyone of that and I don't live a homosexual lifestyle. 

I.e. I think condoms are okay, but we don't use them or tell others that it is okay.

Let me know what you think! I am not looking to debate what church teaching is, because I am aware. I've made up my mind right now. I am always open to a change of heart in the future, but right now I am just not there.

"Invitation to ask St. Maria Goretti to pray for us - biography, imitations, and prayer. Trigger warning: sexual abuse, threatening and murder.",ohwell17,1625581929,"Today's Saint is St. Maria Goretti, a young, brave, courageous virgin and martyr. 

She was born in a poor Italian family in 1890, on the 16th of October precisely. 
She had 6 brothers and sisters: Antonio (who, God bless him, died in infancy), Angelo, Maria, Mariano, Alessandro, Ersilia, and Teresa. 

When she was five her family because so poor that they had to give up their property and farm and work for a different family, the Serenelli family, which included Giovanni Serenelli and his son, future murderer and rapist, Alessandro Serenelli.

When Maria was 9 her father tragically died of malaria, which led to her mother and all her siblings to start working in the fields, leaving her to do the housework.

Maria was a very faithful young lady indeed, she received her first Communion at the age of 12 and, in spite of her love for God, she still struggled with catechism class. 

The worst happened on July 5th 1902: Maria was alone right outside the house, sewing, when Alessandro Serenelli, 18 at the time, threatened to sexually abuse of her and told her that if she didn't do what he told her he would've stabbed her. Upon request of having a coitus with him, she refused, telling him that God didn't want it, that it was a sin, that he would go to hell for it. After her response, Alessandro started stabbing her multiple times. She was later found by her mother Assunta and brought to the nearest hospital.

There she was operated and underwent surgery, during which she woke up. After telling her doctor that she would think of him in heaven, she expressed forgiveness towards Alessandro, saying she would want him to be in heaven with her, and concern over her mother's wellbeing. After the failed surgery Maria died.

On April 27 1947 Maria was beatified in front of her mother by Pope Pius XII who, at the St. Peter's basilica, walked up to Maria's mother Assunta to greet her. 

She was later sanctified on the 24th of June 1950: her mother, her siblings and Alessandro were all present at the sanctification.

She is the paitron saint of chastity, rape victims, girls, youth, teenage girls, poverty, purity, and forgiveness.

We can and all should imitate her strength, courage and forgiveness. If she, after what happened, could forgive her attacker, even wishing for him to be with her in heaven, we all should.  

Let's all ask St. Maria Goretti to pray for us in the following prayer:

Dear God, we ask you to help all those who suffer from abuse. Help them find healing and peace in their life. May Maria Goretti who was strengthened by Your Grace join with us in prayer for healing of all victims of abuse, particularly those abused as children or young adults.",Catholicism

I’m probably gonna go to hell,DryCoast,1625580170,"Let’s just say that I got lots of mental health problems, and I’ve committed mortal sins that have helped me with those issues and will continue to do so. I got some plans to commit some more mortal sins to help with my mental health because idk, at this point I don’t have much more hope in life. I tried therapy for several years but am gonna try it again. If it doesn’t help them I’m gonna commit the sins and, unfortunately, I don’t think I’ll be sorry to God because if they’re going to help my mind then how can I be sorry? And I’ll go to confession and have imperfect contrition but I probably won’t be forgiven anyway. With all this, people might say committing those mortal sins won’t be worth it in the end if it means an eternity in Hell but I say it’ll certainly be worth it if it means ending my suffering on this earth. Because it’s getting to a point where my life here on earth is suffering and it’s literally going nowhere. I have little hope nor really any plans for the future and committing these sins will give me the necessary help I need. So, I guess I’ll be seeing you soon, Hell",Catholicism

I had a strange dream about some realization about Pope Francis,hereintransylvaniaaa,1625579169,"Basically I was outside in my yard and I suddenly heard a voice which said something like ""You may not like certain things about Pope Francis, but he is a great Pope, continuing what JP2 has begun""

Basically what it meant was that Pope Francis is kind of like JP2 when it comes down to let's say ""charisma"". Of course he's not *the same*, but he goes into his direction, you know, being open to everyone

So, it just gave me the realization, that although I don't like some things about him (like his unclear way to express himself), he's still a great Pope, continuing what JP2 has begun 

When I realized this, I felt such a great peace and love towards the Pope, I never knew that I can look at him from another perspective.

"Fr Benedict Groeschel CFR comments on the child sex abuse scandal are terrible, is anyone else surprised by this?",Annual_Ad4062,1625577755,"In 2012, Father gave an interview to the NCR (later deleted) saying that it is the child who is the seducer sometimes.

Thoughts on Christopher Hitchens?,TheKingsPeace,1625577400,"What are your thoughts on Christopher Hitchens, the late atheist polemicist?

Even though  I disagree strongly with him, I always liked him more then the other main atheists of the time ( Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins) and just found him more compelling as a human.

His atheism honestly is only a small part of his work product. He only really did the “ anti God” circuit for the last 5-6 years of his life and before then wrote about all sorts of topics from the Iraq War, to Charles Dickens to Harry Potter to all sorts of issues.

He was almost like an intellectual journalist by trade of sort of the really smart observant sort in the tradition of George Orwell or Walter Duranty, which doesn’t exist nearly as much today.

In spite of his atheism he seemed a person of strange integrity and was drawn toward God in a huge way. I’m not sure what it says about an atheist who goes and debates Christian thinkers. Maybe he was looking for God the whole time?

Us catholics need more shows like daredevil.,broji04,1625554564,"I just finished the first season, am eagerly looking forward to the second, and despite a pretty poor ending to the season I really adored the show overall. A large part of my adoration for it does obviously have to do with how great it represents catholicism, the priest is one of my favorite characters with how he balances dogmatism while presenting himself casually, he avoids many pitfals media often has with writing priests. While it's cliche, the main themes of wether you should kill someone are tied directly into Matthew's faith and I love how he is inspired to create his suit. 


All of what I just said is a front for what may be a tough pill for us to sallow, and it's the reason we need *more* shows like daredevil. Most Christian or catholic films, with obvious exceptions, are just bad films, as in from a cinematic perspective. As Ernest as their messages may be, we are really bad at portrating them in a way that resonates with modern audiences. It's a serious issue considering that cinema is the mass media of our time. Daredevil may not be specifically catholic but it represents us, and shows our values better then many shows or movies made By catholics and For catholics. We need to really push for catholic movies to be better and be actually well written, well produced cinema.

 We need to break away from the cookie cutter narratives, cookie cutter set ups, and cookie cutter messages we've got comfortable in. Give me a world War 2 film starring a catholic soldier wrestling with his faith, Or a political drama showing an elected catholic work to maintain his principles, or even a dumb action flick where the main protagonist goes to church on Sundays after shooting aliens Monday through Friday. Im not asking for more approachable film ideas so that they can attract the mass culture and we can hook them in with the catholicism (although that may happen) I'm asking for them because catholic movies can fit into these genres respectfully and give a catholic perspective to them. Move away from making every film an introduction to faith and let's explore catholicism in other genres or tropes.

This is possibly stupid but is it wrong/sinful to willingly ignore old friends? How about being overly reclusive?,shadowbanned_often,1625547753,"I have been recently been approached by many numerous friends who desire to re-ignite friendships/communications with me after I kind of ""ghosted"" them (stopped talking to them and went my own way)

Not sure exactly why this is happening all at the same time by friends who don't even know of each other but that's besides the point.

I know there are sins of *commission* but also that there are sins of *omission.* Now I don't have any particularly big reason for ghosting/ignoring friends other than the fact I am probably one of the most introverted people alive and I find it incredibly exhausting communicating with people.

On one hand I feel like the Christ-like thing to do is to answer their honest attempts to reach out to me and hear them out (whatever it is they all suddenly want to tell me).

On the other hand, I know even replying a single time to all of them will re-open a bunch of ongoing dialogues that will drain me and make me miserable. Having to talk to people literally feels like my lifeforce being sapped from me... maybe there's something wrong with me but it's just how it is and I have been this way since birth.

This may sound like a stupid question but it's important to me because it's a recurring theme in my life. I feel like the worst sin against God I have done in my life isn't things I committed necessarily but more so the things I *could have* done and have not. Jesus lived a highly social life of preaching to others and benefitting His community and I have really never helped my fellow human beings at all due to the fact I'm so reclusive. I spend every possible moment I can alone by myself just reading, learning and thinking, rather than go out in the world and do good. I really can't tell if this is just part of Gods plan for me or if I'm actually being selfish by being how I am. 

I remember the corporal acts of mercy for example and when I hear them all I can think is how I'd never even get the chance to perform them since I keep to myself. I have nobody sick to visit, nobody to feed, etc. I've kept to myself my whole life and if I don't I feel like my spirit is just being sapped from me by having to socialize.",Catholicism

How should I manage my relationship with my family of origin?,thebryantfam,1625540317,"I don't even know where to start... But I'm basically at a point where I'm wondering if I should just take a period of time with no contact with my family of origin as I work on healing myself and improving my boundary setting skills and learning how I can support a healthy relationship with my family. I don't think my family is necessarily so toxic that I need to end contact with them indefinitely, and I really don't *want* to end contact with them, but I fear there isn't a way for us to continue as we have been in any conducive way at this point and I don't think I'm in a place to be able to handle the situation in a healthy way. That's my TL;DR summary of my question, but below are some details - apologies it is so long but the examples are important to convey exactly what situations we're dealing with.

I feel my family (mom, dad, brother, grandparents, aunt, and uncle to be specific) is very toxic. Here are some examples (non-exhaustive) of their behaviors and how they've treated me/my family (meaning me and my husband):

- My mother convinced the entire family that I had bipolar disorder as a way to discredit me and my life decisions to them (and, for the record, I've talked to a counselor about this and they verified that I am definitely not bipolar so it wasn't based in reality at all)
- The night we got married my uncle sent me a text message cussing me out and saying I ""ruined everything"" for the family and my cousin (my aunt and uncle's son who was about 12 years old at the time) texted me after we announced our first pregnancy saying now I really ruined things because I'm pregnant insinuating had I not gotten pregnant I could have left my husband (I of course do not blame my cousin for this as he is young, but it is a good example of what kind of discussions are happening around in from my aunt and uncle)
- For a few months after we got married my family called us liars simply because we didn't give them step by step updates on our personal relationship development the whole time, and my mother and grandmother fully believed and convinced other family members that my husband was a manipulative cult leader, simply because I was baptized and became more public about my political beliefs (which differ greatly from my family) around the time my husband and I got together - even though I had been growing towards God for years and had had my political beliefs for long before I even knew my husband, since they weren't aware of it (because I knew they disagreed with me politically and were/are anti-religion I cared more about your familiar relationships than I did about causing any disrupt to thing by sharing my thoughts - in no way was I deceptive or anything, I just didn't engage in political discussions and didn't bring up religion because it didn't seem necessary to me knowing it would be a point of contention)
- My mother also insinuated that my husband might be a pedophile because he had worked in youth ministry most of his life
- When my mother's smear campaign wasn't working on us she reached out to both my husband and my best friend to talk to them about how emotionally and mentally unstable I am (I'm not perfect but I'm definitely not overly unstable or anything) and basically tried to turn them both against me and get them to agree with her that my behavior is inappropriate; when this didn't work she then tried to basically start a fight between my husband and I or something by twisting some of my husband's words from her phone call with him to try to make me upset - that didn't work either
- When I was pregnant with our first child we decided to tell my dad first thinking he would be the most positive and his response was ""Really? Am I supposed to be happy about that?"" and there were no reasons to *not* be happy about it - we were in a good financial situation and we're doing well marriage wise - there were no reasons to be concerned beyond them not liking the fact that my husband and I married
- After I had my son (or first) my grandmother made a point to ask me if I was on birth control (and she did this in front of my grandfather which felt extra inappropriate) to avoid another pregnancy and she thought the idea of using NFP was stupid and that we'd end up pregnant again super fast and that that would be a bad thing (we of course believe all life is a blessing and this general viewpoint from her was very upsetting for many reasons)
- Most recently we announced our second pregnancy via a public post on Facebook and tagged family as a way to recognize them specifically (after everything else we did not feel comfortable announcing to family individually with past reactions and comments so this is what we felt comfortable with to cause the least amount of stress for us) and rather than being any fraction of happy for us they're only focused on being upset because we didn't announce to them directly first - and they have no interest in considering *why* we didn't feel comfortable with that

I have tried to implement boundaries but I haven't been able to maintain them and don't think I really know how to or even what boundaries to set and trying to maintain them can be very upsetting to me when I get lush back from my family. It's just so hard to deal with this situation. And I know I have a lot of emotional healing to do to be able to be in any relationship with my family that is a healthy one, at least on my end. I worry that trying to continue a relationship with them at this point is just waiting for the next blow up (and that's how we felt leading up to announcing our pregnancy and why we waited so long to do so (I'm almost in the third trimester so we definitely postpone the announcement for a while)). If I do cut contact for a period of time I currently do have the intention to try to restart that relationship at some point when I feel I have healed more and am in a place to build that relationship up on healthy boundaries and a healthy foundation (and of course I will seek therapy to support this and it will take a lot of introspection on myself as well). The thought of cutting contact is devastating to me because I desperately just want to be close with my family but I just keep getting hurt by them and they really just aren't welcoming to me nor my family anymore because I refuse to ignore their disrespect and hurtful comments and everyone else in the family just brushes drama under the rug and acts like it's all okay and everyone refuses to have honest conversations about things and take responsibility for their actions and I just don't see a way to be part of that while I heal myself. I also fear how the negativity can brlee dinto my own family. Our son is 15 months old and in three months we'll have a baby girl too. I don't want them to ever feel the way I did growing up - completely invalidated my whole childhood. And I don't want them to be exposed to this kind of behavior and my husband and I definitely have a fear of my mother or anyone attempting to poison our children's view of us with lies and manipulation.

We do plan to sit down with our local pastor to discuss this as well but I would appreciate any wisdom here as well in the meantime as it will likely be a while before we can meet with our pastor and this is really weighing on me and I'd like to at least start mentally preparing for whatever the right direction is for us to take.

If you took the time to read this and respond I really appreciate it - God bless you.

I never watched anything with gore in it, but I read some details and I stumbled into some DVD covers with some Graphic imagery on them that was, well, pretty disturbing and real.

That stuff was pretty disgusting, morbid, and saddening. I know it was my fault for looking into info about the genre in the first place, but I'm afraid that my mind became scarred, and that it made me slightly mentally ill.

Possible demonic activity?,thisispluto,1625535259,"Warning: long post. Also using my throwaway. 


This is a true account of something that happened to my wife and I.  It’ll read like a creepypasta but I can assure you it’s true. 

 We were lying in bed watching TV before going to sleep, late at night.  Once it was time to go to sleep, I turned off the lights, the TV, and tried to turn the soundbar off, only it wouldn’t turn off. I pressed the button over and over, and nothing happened.  I put down the remote to get up, and immediately the numbers on the screen of the soundbar that indicate volume started going up and down, without me touching the remote.  I got up and pressed the off button on the stereo itself, and still it wouldn’t turn off. I unplugged it from the wall and it finally went off. 

So we get settled into bed and hit the lights.  I’m looking around the room and I notice everything is red.  The room isn’t brighter, there’s no light coming from anything, or in through the window, but I just see red.  It’s as if the air itself had turned red.  My wife, without me mentioning anything, asks if I see that the room is red.  I turn the lights on, normal coloring. Lights back off, and the room is red.  No light, just a red tint to the whole room.  

I’m laying back in bed and looking at the ceiling, and I see a round black spot on the ceiling.  Again, there’s no light, so there’s nothing casting a shadow.  Just a pitch black splotch on the ceiling. I ask my wife if she sees it, and she says she does.   Lights on, nothing. Lights off, black spot on the ceiling.  We’re both pretty freaked out, so we turn the lights on, say a few Our Fathers, Hail Marys, and St Michael’s Prayers.  We slept with the lights on that night.  

It’s never happened again since.  Yesterday I was listening to Pints with Aquinas, the episode where he interviews Exorcist Vincent Lampert, and Fr. Lampert says that the times he has seen demons, they look like round pitch-black blobs, basically exactly what we saw.   

Needless to say, I’m a little freaked out.  Maybe I’m imagining things, but my wife and I both saw the same things. I really can’t think of any explanation.",Catholicism

So, I only ask this question so I don’t waste our new associate pastor’s time in the confessional at 6:00 AM tomorrow morning just for one thing. 

I confessed spiritual sloth, and oddly enough my Monsignor asked me what made me think I did so. I have a habit/thing, I get up at 4:00AM so I can make mass and leave for work right after. I get horrifically tired and I put off daily mass ‘for tomorrow’ because I’m tired. This has led to many relapses because I *need* those graves to just walk around. I’m like a baby, okay? I’m completely helpless without the Blessed Sacrament. So, this morning, believing I had committed a sin, and was tired had put off daily mass. My assumption was answered, and I didn’t actually commit a sin…

Afraid of marriage but also afraid of not marrying,BeautifulGenius10,1625526409,"I read that Doctors of the Church said virgins have greater glory in heaven.

But there's still a lot of societal stigma against unmarried women, and people around me have been pressuring me to get married. But I feel like I haven't met a guy who's ""worth it"". What if I give an imperfect guy a chance then he mistreats me? I'd feel awful about losing ""greater glory in heaven"" for a guy like that. But other people would probably just tell me to ""forgive"", driving me even crazier. But I'm afraid of people looking down on me if I become an old, unmarried woman. I suppose one choice would be to become a consecrated virgin and just tell people, but what if I later change my mind? What if I meet ""the one"" only after becoming a consecrated virgin? I wish God would just tell me exactly what to do, whether or not to marry and who/when to marry if I should marry. I'm not even sure who would have a greater glory in heaven, a virgin who has kids through artificial insemination then later goes to confession for it and never does it again, or someone who has kids through natural means. Because sins can be forgiven but lost virginity cannot be taken back. But even for artificial insemination, all men have to do is ejaculate, but for women, a device would need to be inserted into the body, which would break the hymen and be more invasive.

"Strange bedfellows: ""Far-right"" and Catholicism",SnakeAmethyst23,1625523479,"So a guy reached out to me on social media and asked about Catholicism because he was planning to convert. I was happy cuz nowadays, I felt like more Catholics are leaving the Church than the number of non-Catholics converting to Catholicism. 

He was asking questions about Mary and why she was so revered in the Church and I tried to explain in a succinct way so it'd make sense and he said it did. 

Then I asked him what made him want to convert to Catholicism and he said because of Nick Fuentes, who is a right-wing political figure and supposedly practices Catholicism. The media tried to label him ""far-right"" but I don't trust the media anyways so I take their labels with a grain of salt and often put quotation marks around their labels. 

Now, I'm just intrigued by ""far right"" politics pulling in non-Catholics closer to the Church. I guess I shouldn't be complaining but it's very interesting that the ""far-right"" and Catholicism have become bedfellows. Strange but interesting. Typically, Catholics are seen as more level-headed than Protestants, so the ""far-right""'s nod of approval would make it interesting to see which direction the Church could go in the future.

This is a 180 shift from Catholicism once being overwhelmed by left-wingers or moderate liberals. Now it seems like there's a rightward shift in the Church.

St Therese of Lisieux has a message for those scrupulous who are afraid to receive the Eucharist,Pedrop64,1625518200,"From her letter to Marie Guerin:

“Before you confided in me, I felt you were suffering, and my heart was one with yours. Since you have the humility to ask advice of your little Thérèse, this is what she thinks: you have grieved me greatly by abstaining from Holy Communion, because you have grieved Our Lord.

The devil must be very cunning to deceive a soul in this way. Do you not know, dear Marie, that by acting thus you help him to accomplish his end? The treacherous creature knows quite well that when a soul is striving to belong wholly to God he cannot cause her to sin, so he merely tries to persuade her that she has sinned.

This is a considerable gain, but not enough to satisfy his hatred, so he aims at something more and tries to shut out Jesus from a tabernacle which Jesus covets. Unable to enter this sanctuary himself, he wishes that at least it remain empty and without its God.

Alas, what will become of that poor little heart? When the devil has succeeded in keeping a soul from Holy Communion he has gained all his ends . . . while Jesus weeps! . . .

Remember, little Marie, that this sweet Jesus is there in the Tabernacle expressly for you and you alone. Remember that He burns with the desire to enter your heart. Do not listen to Satan. Laugh him to scorn, and go without fear to receive Jesus, the God of peace and of love.

""Thérèse thinks all this""—you say—""because she does not know my difficulties."" She does know, and knows them well; she understands everything, and she tells you confidently that you can go without fear to receive your only true Friend. She, too, has passed through the martyrdom of scruples, but Jesus gave her the grace to receive the Blessed Sacrament always, even when she imagined she had committed great sins. I assure you I have found that this is the only means of ridding oneself of the devil. When he sees that he is losing his time he leaves us in peace.

In truth it is impossible that a heart which can only find rest in contemplation of the Tabernacle—and yours is such, you tell me—could so far offend Our Lord as not to be able to receive Him . . . What does offend Jesus, what wounds Him to the Heart, is want of confidence.

Pray much that the best portion of your life may not be overshadowed by idle fears. We have only life's brief moments to spend for the Glory of God, and well does Satan know it. This is why he employs every ruse to make us consume them in useless labour. Dear sister, go often to Holy Communion, go very often—that is your one remedy.”",Catholicism

Kind of like how an advanced AI's hardware can create ""consciousness"" by reacting to stimuli so much so that they mimic real consciousness but an AI itself is incapable of experiencing.

I also said that this is one of the few things we can be certain of and I quoted Descartes ""I think therefore I am"".

My husband and I want to give the Catholic church a chance,atadbitcatobsessed,1625496716,"Hi all,

I just needed to write this out somewhere. My husband and I are both believers, but for the longest time we haven't been to church because of demanding work schedules. We're in our late 20s. Long story short, we finally learned that some churches offer services outside of just Sunday morning. 

We never knew this because the churches we went to as kids only offered Sunday mornings, so we thought there was no other option. I really wish we knew this sooner, because then we wouldn't have been away from as long as we were. :(

Anyways, once we realized this, we started ""church shopping"" for lack of a better term. He went to a non denominational church growing up and I went to a Methodist one. So that's what we were looking at. No Methodist churches near us have evening services, so we found a non denominational one that does.

Now we have been attending there for a month or so. While I do like a lot of things about it, I can't help but feel pulled to give the Catholic church a chance. While researching churches I also have done a lot of reading about Christianity in general, and a lot of things that Catholics believe make a whole lot it sense to me. For example, it makes no sense to me that all you have to do is believe in Jesus to be saved. Even satan knows God is real. It's definitely more than that. 

My husband agrees and also thinks that the church we are going to now might not ""be it."" Also, not that it's important, but we think they are WAY too focused on music. Like, the first 20 minutes of each service is like a mini concert. We keep thinking... ""this is nice but... please get onto the sermen already! Lol."" My husband is also not 100% of board with how they are presenting their sermens. He prefers more detailed sermens over the very board feel-goody messages. I agree. So we decided to attend a Catholic mass next. 

We also decided to try it out now because if it feels right I learned that RCIA start in September, so that would be good timing.

I just have a lot worries. I am worried about is ""culture shock."" I know it's very different than what we're used to. We are laid back and casual people, which is what drew us to modern churches in the 1st place. I am also worried about not feeling like we belong. Part of the reason why my parents (and I think to an extent his parents too) did not follow Catholicism despite having a family history of it was because they felt like Catholics were very judgemental and overly strict compared to other denominations. (I mean no disrespect to anyone by saying this. I'm just explaining their reasoning). 

I don't really have a point to this post other than I needed to write it out somewhere and I would appreciate prayers for my husband and I as we figure out our faith journey. We are yearning for a church to call home and personally I hate feeling lost like this jumping around denominations. I just want to find the truth.",Catholicism

Help: Did this Mass contain liturgical abuses?,Silent-Guitar4526,1625494418,"I attended Mass recently and left a bit uneasy as there were some parts that I thought shouldn't be happening. To be fair, I've been told by one of my family members before that I am a bit scrupulous and too harsh on this, and I've never read the Missal before and wouldn't know much anyway(that's why I'm asking here). Still, I attend Mass frequently so I have some idea of what's normal and what's not. Also, the priest is very elderly and frail so I understand that not everything might be possible for him.

Anyway, here's everything that sticked out to me:

First, the priest began Mass only wearing the Alb I think?(I'm not familiar with vestments that much, but it was just a completely plain white garment.) Then after the penitential rite he left the altar and added the stole while the lector was reading the First Reading. No chasuble I believe.

Second, there was a lay person altar serving but with no liturgical clothes on, just completely in normal lay clothing. 

Third, I think priest was using old translation, saying ""you who live and reign in the unity of the Holy Spirit, One God, etc."" instead of omitting the ""one"" and also in the part before Our Father,  ""informed by the Word of God we dare to say"" instead of ""informed by divine teaching"". 

Fourth, at the ""Lord I am not worthy..."" the priest is not raising the Eucharist so that it is visible. The Eucharist and the Chalice remain on the altar. I think priest just has his hands up like in the Our Father.

Fifth, and this is what bothered me the most and made me post this, because I was very uneasy about this, is that the priest asked us to come up by the altar(in the sanctuary I think?) and receive communion. The altar is on a raised level surface and we stepped up on that surface and were were literally like right next, side by side, to the altar when receiving Communion. Normally in the past we just received from a lay minister since the priest couldn't come down. 

Am I being way to scrupulous and this is acceptable, or is that actually some abuse? My mind is a bit not at peace right now, so I appreciate the help! Also whether I'm in wrong or right, please keep it charitable! I might be misremembering or getting some details wrong in any case, and father seems to be a very nice priest.",Catholicism

"The BSA, Trail Life, and Catholic Youth Ministry",Gersh0m,1625488105,"TL;DR:  The BSA is no longer suitable for youth ministry.  Having looked at the options, I believe I can recommend Trail Life.  

I have no affiliation with Trail Life (yet) but as the father of two boys who will soon be of scouting age and as an Eagle Scout, the question of where to put them when they come of age has been eating at me lately.  I think I've found a solution and would like your thoughts.  

As you might have known, the Boy Scouts has undergone a number of membership controversies in addition to their own abuse scandal that dwarfs our own (over 84,000 claims).  If you haven’t, here’s a recap:

2013:  BSA decides to allow openly gay kids into scouting

2015:  BSA decides to allow openly gay adults to serve in troop leadership positions

2017:  BSA decides to allow transgender kids into scouts after the case of an 8 year-old girl in New Jersey.

2018:  BSA decides to go co-ed with gender-segregated troops

2020:  BSA decides to institute a diversity, equity, and inclusion merit badge that will be required for Eagle Scout.  

I believe that these changes make the BSA unsuitable for Christian ministry and have started looking for an alternative.  Now, to be fair to them, they always have allowed chartering organizations (i.e. the church that hosts the troop) to set membership standards for the unit so a Catholic organization can get around the 2015 change.  They’ve also allowed churches to create religious ed programs.  Ours is the ""Ad Altare Dei"" medal.  They also have and encourage the use of a chaplain among the troop’s leadership.  Theoretically, you could structure a troop to be an outdoors extension of parish youth ministry.  But they don’t really allow troops to set membership standards among the youth so far as I know and, if the draft requirements of the new merit badge are any indicator, they will be mandating instruction as to how any chartering organization who takes advantage of these carve-outs is neither diverse, nor equitable, nor inclusive.  

That’s bad enough.  They will be indoctrinating your kids in an ideology that’s counter to the faith and that teaches them to view the faith with suspicion.  But the bankruptcy caused by their abuse scandal has created another problem for Catholic parishes and schools:  Liability.  Because the contract is written such that the chartering organization owns the troop and all its assets, some of them will be on the hook for further lawsuits after the BSA finishes settling.  This is going to push parishes to either take complete ownership or to disavow the troop.  Both likely mean destroying active troops because then every volunteer will need both BSA’s Youth Protection Training and the Church’s Virtus training and, since it requires this level of oversight now, the Scoutmaster, Assistant Scoutmaster, and other adult leaders will now have to be very carefully vetted by the pastor for their orthodoxy.  Since this has not heretofore been the case, any such action would likely destroy a troop’s volunteer base and paralyze it.  

This leads me to Trail Life USA.  This organization was formed after the 2013 decision by a bunch of former Boy Scouts.  Their general counsel, for instance, was general counsel for the BSA once upon a time.  When they founded their new organization, they focused on creating a youth movement which would solve structural problems latent in BSA.  If you look at it as a scouting organization, you’ll see that they actually did make significant improvements to how the youth are organized in units.  But I’m more interested in their religious programming.  They require that any chartering organization actually be a Christian church, school, or ministerial organization that adheres to a Trinitarian creed.  They have a statement of faith and values that is explicitly orthodox, and they have worked religious education thoroughly into the heart of the program.  While the founders were evangelicals, they were wise enough to make the religious ed a template that is customizable to each tradition’s distinctives.  This means that Catholic troops can and are developing fully Catholic catechesis for Trail Life through the group Troops Fully Alive and the National Catholic Committee on Trail Life.  And Trail Life demands ab initio the kind of control by the chartering organization that the BSA only permits, so you get the chance to build from the ground up an organization that is effectively an outdoors extension of parish youth ministry.  

Now, I recommend Trail Life over Troops of St. George because Trail Life seems to me the closer successor to BSA.  They have inherited the traditions of scouting and improved the structure.  Looking at TSG, they just don't seem like scouting.  They're *way* too militaristic.  Also, as a sign of where things are going, Both TAC and Christendom College communities have chartered Catholic Trail Life units.  That's a healthy vote of confidence.  

As an Eagle Scout, it pains me to not share with my children the awards and achievements that I got in scouting, but Eagle Scout is not worth their soul.  With Trail Life, I believe I can share scouting with them and help ensure that they grow into faithful Catholics.  If any of you have real experience with this program or insight into the question, I would like to hear your thoughts.",Catholicism

Catholic health care directives,River-19671,1625479254,"I am thinking about coming back to the church after years away, but one of the issues I am struggling with is whether I can have a health care directive.

I hope that the end of my life is many decades away but I know so many people who have died, my age and younger, and want to let my family know my wishes.

I am concerned that I might have to accept more end of life health care than I want if I come back to the church.  I worry about going into a coma and ending up on life support for years like Terri Schiavo.  I do know that I have to accept nutrition as a priest told me so.

I come from a Protestant background and all my grandparents have passed away.  One of them had a DNR order which was followed.

Does anyone know if a Catholic can validly have a health care directive and if so, what are the guidelines?  I am thinking of having one not only for end of life decisions but also for medical care if I am unable to decide for myself.  My family is Protestant; could I appoint them as health care agents or do the decision makers need to be Catholics?

Novus Ordo Final Commendation,CrossOfScuple,1625474289,"https://catholicexchange.com/where-has-the-catholic-funeral-mass-gone

The invitations to prayer do bug me:

Option 1:
Before we go our separate ways, let us take leave of our brother/sister. May our farewell express our affection for him/her; may it ease our sadness and strengthen our hope. **One day we shall joyfully greet him/her again** when the love of Christ, which conquers all things, destroys even death itself.

Isn't this presumptuous? Everyone will rise again for either eternal life **or eternal death,** and so even that we will rise, joyfully greet each other again is not for sure. 

Option 2:
Trusting in God, we have prayed together for (N.) and now we come to the last farewell. There is sadness in parting, but we take comfort **in the hope that one day we shall see N. again and enjoy his/her friendship.** Although this congregation will disperse in sorrow, the mercy of God will **gather us together again in the joy of his kingdom.** Therefore let us console one another in the faith of Jesus Christ.

This sounds better at first, since we take comfort ""in the hope"", not in certainty. But then what does ""us"" refer to in ""gather us together again in the joy of his kingdom""? Putting into context it seems to mean we (the congregation) and the deceased person, which again, isn't this presumptuous?

To put a long story short, we were not attending Mass for a while because of covid and just started going back every Sunday a couple months ago. We have a beautiful 15 month old with a LOT of energy. He also started walking very early so he runs and climbs like nobody's business. He doesn't really have meltdowns at all at Mass, but he loves hearing his voice and making noise, and fusses when he can't just run around. My husband's instinct is to immediately take him into the foyer or the mother's room. I'd like to stay with him in the pew as long as possible, but we are both trying our best to be mindful of others, too. We've also had a couple of grouchy old men rudely tell us there is a cry room after my son made a single, non-upset noise before Mass, so that made us a little self-conscious, too. It also seems like he's the only kid his age there, there are tons of kids but everyone else is pretty much old enough to know better or too little to even be mobile. 

I guess mainly what I'm hoping for is some advice on how to handle my very active, energetic toddler who isn't even 1 1/2 yet. We feel caught in between him being big enough to want to run and play, but too little to understand the right way to act at Mass.

Catholicism's religious teachings have nothing to do with sexual abuse. The abuse scandal is a modern social phenomenon that emerged in the 19th and 20th century due to incompetent bureaucratic policies.,Anglicanpolitics123,1625452176,"So I am posting this as someone who is not Catholic(Anglican) but who is interested in facts and clearing up myths and misinformation. One of the things you hear a lot, especially in the wake of many abuse scandals in the Church is that Catholicism, and even Christianity in general is a ""pedophile cult"". Like there is something within it that just inherently celebrates or promotes pedophilia. That is inherently false when when look at Church history and historic attitudes to sexual abuse by Church leaders.

The fact of the matter is is that before the 19th century for several centuries you had harsh punishments and condemnations of sexual abuse, and this goes back to the foundations of Christianity itself. The Christian movement emerged out of a Greco-Roman culture where pederasty was normal(older men having a sexual relationship with younger boys). The Early Church condemned that and the Christian movement initiated a cultural revolution in terms of our attitudes towards sexual abuse. So for example the Didache, the earliest Christian document outside of the Bible written during the lifetime of the Apostles explicitly said ""You shall not commit pederasty"".

As the Christian movement expanded the penalties became more stringent. The Council of Elvira excommunicated those found guilty of pederastic or pedophilic behaviour. The Church Father St Basil the Great in the 4th century addressed the specific question of what someone is to do if a cleric is found guilty of sexual abuse. Basil's recommendation are pretty stringent. First they are to be whipped several times in public(using the same whip used against slaves). Then they are to be dragged through the streets where crowds can spit on them. After that they are to be put in jail and given minimum food so they have just enough to stay alive while suffering hunger and starvation.

Coming up to the Middle Ages one of the most prominent reformers and activists was a man named St Peter Damian. He was known for campaigning against corruption, and also sexual abuse, writing a whole treatise on it in his work ""The Book of Gommorrah"". For clergy who engage in sexual abuse of minors the penalty for Peter Damian is clear. Death. Peter Damian interestingly is not only a saint but in Dante's Inferno placed in a highest part of Paradise. This continued with Pope Innocent III who along with other Popes engaged in the policy of ""degradation"" where the priest is stripped of their clerical office and handed over to the authorities who are to be present when the priest is being stripped of their title so they can prosecute them. The Fourth Lateran Council reinterates all of the punishments when it came to priests accused of abuse and also put in place sanctions for bishops accused of covering up abuse. This is in the 1200s. Gratian, one of the most prominent Canon Laws reiterated St Basil and St Peter Damian's views of pedophilia and penalties for clergy abuse into Canon Law, including the penalty of death in many cases. This all culminates with the Inquisition.

Many think that the Inquisition only investigated heresy. Wrong. The Inquisition also investigated many other things and one of those things was pedophilia in society. Whether its in the clergy or in the general society. Between 1570 and 1630 the Inquisition tried 1000 cases of people accused of these acts. 1/5 were clerics(200). The penalty for all of those clerics was death. In some cases this would have been death by burning. In other cases the Inquisition didn't waste time burning pedophiles, including pedophile priests to death and just went in the jail cell and had them straggled with a cord. In other cases they might if they were lenient sentence them to either hard labour and have them whipped in public. The Council of Trent continued the codification of the policy of handing sexual abuses over to the state and law enforcement to be punished and Pius vi and Pius v made this policy even more clearer to include those who committed crimes in the confessional.

So historically what we see is that the Church not only punished pedophilia, but punished it in much harsher terms than modern society ever would. This unfortunately changed in the 19th century beginning in 1842 and then 1866 due to a combination of the weakening of the Holy Office as well as terrible bureaucratic decisions. In 1842 the decision was made that reporting did not have to be mandated if it involved cases in countries where women were shamed for coming forward as well as countries without a strong legal system. That loophole was exploited and in some cases these things expanded in 1866 where the clerical proceedings around an abusive priests were kept secret. This was due to the fact that in some cases abuse victims did not want their story to be publicised. However this, combined with the Holy Office weakening and the local bishops being entrusted to oversee these cases created the conditions for a modern disaster.

But a shown above, the abuse scandal that we see has nothing to do with Catholicism or Christianity's teachings. Sexual abuse has clearly been condemned in the historic teachings of the Church. It has to do with modern changes and bureaucratic incompetence in the modern world. So when people point to things like celibacy or women not being priests or things of that nature that's just false. It is also false to assert that Catholic priests are inherently likely to engage in abuse because the data shows that around 4% of priests are guilty of abuse. That number should be zero. However its clear that the overwhelming number of priests aren't sexual abusers, and that Catholicisms teachings or beliefs have nothing to do with the abuse scandal. When you look at the historic record it shows abusers were going against the teachings of the Church. And that's obvious even today where rape is considered a mortal sin that sends your soul to hell.",Catholicism

It's disgusting to see eating contests,SnakeAmethyst23,1625450366,"So I saw this [article](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/07/joey-chestnut-once-again-devours-the-competition-at-nathans-famous-hot-dog-eating-contest) on a guy who won the hotdog eating contest today on the 4th of July and I can't help but be disgusted with it. 

I've seen so many eating contests and I hate how some people are encouraging and cheering for the participants' health deterioration. Honestly, eating contests should be a crime. It's a waste of resources and I can't imagine the thousands of hungry people who would've been fed with the cornucopia of food. It's also encouraging participants to take a very risky and unnecessary activity and many even died joining. 

I guess this abomination is a reminder for most of us to fast and remember those living in famine and those with nothing, and if we can, share our food with others.

I corrolate this now with this bc after  a full 12-15 days of this and tell me when it started I noticed it was when I started praying so out of curiosity, I stop and turn off the fake candle.

about 6 month ago she fell and pinched a nerve in her back. I went back to St-Anna Basilica and since maybe 3-4 months I got weekly and I specifically asked for this - and for some reason for the last 3 months my Mother told me today she is very depress, like never before and she has no reason to as she told me.. to the point of having suicidal thoughts.

Catholic criticism of Islam,3nd_Game,1625444910,"Hello all,

God bless you all and may you have a good start to the week.

Yesterday I ended up in a discussion with two Muslim street preachers with a leaflet stall.  One of them caught my attention and we had a discussion.  Obviously the subject of Catholicism came up.  I asked him about the Islamic view of the Apostles and Jesus.  

He had some misconceptions, namely; “Jesus called out to God with his last breath so how could he be God or the son of God” to which I told him that the original Aramaic translates it to “Father, it is done” (or to that effect).  He also did not really know who St Paul or St James were.  He claimed that St Paul started Christianity as the faith the Roman Empire, to which I told him there was a 300 year gap between Paul’s encounter with Our Lord and the establishment of Christianity as the religion of Rome.  He did not really know much about the Apostles or the Gospels by his own admission,so he handed me over to his “more knowledgable brother”.  

The second man proceeded to give this long winding diatribe that culminated in “you cannot fit a foot into a shoe that is too small so how can God fit himself into a human”.  The second man came across as slightly more confrontational and possibly even mentally ill, he couldn’t look me in the eye for more than a second at a time as he spoke, so I decided not to bother going back and forth with him.  I left it at that.

From this encounter I am curious about Catholic rebuttals to Islam be they videos, books or any other texts.  Where can I find some?",Catholicism

Incoming Catholic who has had a couple of odd interactions. Looking for insight.,Rock-it1,1625440874,"I am not yet a Catholic, but am on my way into the Church, and I could not be happier or more excited about it. I have been attending the same parish since 2018. In fact, despite living in one of the largest cities in the country (with terrible traffic) and having moved several times at varying distances from the parish, I have never once thought about finding one closer to my locale. I chose this one specifically because the building itself is a beautiful 100+ year old chapel, and the doctrinal and theological approach is what I respond to - traditional and faithful without being ""trad.""

After mass I stay behind for a few minutes to pray in the silence. Once the chapel clears out I make my way to the front to pray before the Virgin and St. Joseph. Ok, the scene is set. 

Last week I walked down the central aisle, knelt and crossed myself as I always do, and was about to go to the statue of the Theotokos when this older woman, early 70s if I had to guess, tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I dropped something. I responded that no, I didn't. I was just kneeling to cross myself before the crucifix. She looked at me as if I was explaining neuroscience to her - bewilderment with just a hint of offense, I thought. Honestly, as a licensed professional counselor I was getting some moderate mental illness vibes. But, whatever, it was an odd exchange but no harm no foul. 

This morning I am about to kneel before St. Joseph and this same lady says to me while I am in the process of kneeling, ""You are supposed to tithe before you pray."" I looked back at her and said, ""Excuse me?"" She repeated herself, ""You are supposed to tithe before you pray. You're not supposed to pray before giving a tithe. I've seen you do this before."" ...? I said something about still learning the way things go but she didn't seem interested in this, as she had already half turned away from me and was walking towards the deacon who co-presided over the mass.

I was so taken aback that I could not even pretend to muddle my way through a prayer to St. Joseph. I said a very quick Jesus Prayer and left, partly in anger that this place I have come to love, the only real constant in my life and shelter from the storm now seems to be a place where I am uncomfortable. I am an over-thinker, a second guesser, and a recovering ""I assume that everything I am doing is wrong""'er, and this checked all three boxes.

Can someone help me make sense of this? Was this just an instance of Karen from the Church Council? Was I in the wrong at any point, and if so, where and in what way(s)?

This is a double whammy because first I will be dinged for trying to look at it. In addition to the filters, I also cut off the Internet access on my phone.  It sounds pretty drastic but it's worth it. Now I spend less time watching TV and Web surfing. I have more time to spend with my wife and kids. Drinking of living water is truly satisfying.

How would I go about being forgiven of apostasy I committed when I was a child?,GrimGutzDaFlash,1625416774,"Hey everyone, hope your days are all going well.

I was baptized into the Catholic Church as a baby and believed until I was maybe ten or so. For years after that I became a very staunch and professing atheist. I made lots of disparaging comments towards the faith and fully renounced it verbally. Its a period of my life I look back on with lots of sadness.

However, four or so years ago I returned to the faith, got confirmed, and have since believed fully in Our Lord.

My question is, how would I go about being forgiven of my past apostasy? I hear that apostasy can only be forgiven by the pope himself.

Attempting to discuss the lack of similar outcry for all Boy Scouts fails because people say the hierarchy doesn’t exist there.

"My heart is divided between Catholicism and Islam, my faith has been slowly eroding...",OneTimeSincereGuy,1625409206,"Since I was a kid I always dreamed of finding a good woman to marry, a woman who was pure in body and soul, who waited all her life to me in the time of marriage and to both be pure and chaste. I've been searching for that woman for long to no avail. What I see now is a desire for lust in women who call themselves ""catholic"" a rampant promiscuity, it is the norm for them to go to parties, get drunk, have sex, and do it in their 20's. To add to that nowadays marriage are based in superficial things, women marry because of money or because of social status, marriage isn't based in spirituality nor a desire to reach God.

I have been recently reading about Muslim women. I read that since a young age their are formed in strong moral values, that when they seek a partner they don't do it for economic reasons, nor status, nor looks, there is a desire to find a good partner with spiritual values that love them. They remain pure and chaste until marriage and they don't even show their hair to their husbands, and after they marry they do the first time and feel nervous and to me it seems as very innocent, and pure and nice, while when western men put the ring to western women they have had lots of one night stands in their backs, the woman didn't wait for them, they fornicated and these marriages oftentimes end in divorce, if the woman doesn't feel happy anymore or if the man falls into poverty she divorces him.

It is shocking to contrast this with Muslim women who are taught to love and support they husband, to always be with him and if he falls into poverty to help him get out of it. These women really love their husbands and support them in everything, the husband doesn't need to worry about their women cheating on them.

Honestly, with all these qualities I see Muslim women as highly desirable, the kind of women I hoped to find in my life to marry with.

I've been told to wait, that the right women would come, it has been decades and still nothing.

I am slowly losing my faith, if I happen to meet a single Muslim woman and she likes me and I like her, It would be hard for me to tell if I would still remain catholic.",Catholicism

Do you think my mass obligation would be dispensed in this case?,Equal_Name,1625407201,"So on holy days of obligations I probably have school on some of them.

Struggling,histtohrev,1625403598,"Hey all. I am struggling with a few things and I wanted to see if you all could help.

Some background:

Late 20s male. Cradle Catholic. Have a young family. I grew up attending a novus ordo parish (some Catholic school too). I started attending a TLM parish when I met my wife but we moved last fall so the old TLM parish is too far of a drive now. We have been attending novus ordo parishes since. 


Throughout November/December of last year and into early this year, I came very close to converting to Orthodoxy (or at least starting the process). I ended up deciding not to, mostly because of the organizational mess within the Orthodox Church, and some of the other inconsistencies in teaching that that causes. Hearing Michael Lofton talk about coming back to Catholicism from Orthodoxy was kind of the final nail in the coffin for me staying in the church.

Prior to this, and what drove me through looking into orthodoxy in the first place, what is the news and the constant drip drip drip of stupidness, foolishness, and so on coming from some of the bishops as well as out of Rome. So in February or March of this year, I decided that I was just gonna put my head down, try to ignore most of that, and just focus on me and Christ… Go to mass and unfollow a lot of those personalities and new sites that cover the happenings in the church. 

But now…I am struggling for a few reasons


1-man oh man….the masses I have been attending (the vast majority of them) have been BAD. My dad’s side is all protestant, and when I was growing up, sometimes I would attend church with them on Sundays if I was visiting them over the weekend or what have you. I can say with certainty that some of these masses felt more like protestant services than Catholic in their overall feel. In fact, I was attending mass with my sister‘s fiancé (who is converting to Catholicism) and he told me for sure that several of the songs played at mass a few weeks ago we’re played and sung at his old super-evangelical old church. My wife and I  thought that maybe it was just one parish in the area that looks like this, but we have went to several and it’s been rough pretty much all over down here. At one of the masses we attended, during the sung Our Father, everybody held hands, then held her hands in the air, and suede back-and-forth as it was sung. Between the dude in - ponytail and the guitar playing like it was a 70s cover band and that, all we would’ve needed were some people holding up lighters while we were doing that then the look would’ve been complete. These are just a few examples. My overarching point here is that there have been many times where if you closed your eyes and were dropped into the building at the time, not very many people would have recognized it as a catholic mass. And, certainly not anybody from say 200 years ago.  At Christmas Eve mass last year, the priest was cracking jokes DURING the eucharistic prayer. 

I can’t help but contrast some of the things I’ve seen and experienced recently, with the four Orthodox divine liturgies I have been to at various stages of my life. They were all just regular parishes, on regular Sundays, and I can’t help but feel that they were all far more reference than a lot of what I have been experiencing recently. 

 Now obviously the subjective beauty of the two points above, don’t mean that one is correct over the other, or anything like that. But, I just can’t shake this feeling, that’s some of the issues that I have been experiencing at some of these novus ordo parishes are a symptom of a larger problem. 

2-I ran across this when I was looking into Orthodoxy. I watched a lot of debates, read alot quotes and sources on both sides, and I just see the evidence for papal primacy/supremacy in the early church. One of the biggest issues I see is that I feel like alot of what Catholics point to as proof could be explained away because of a primacy of honor for Rome as the orthodox would say. Now don’t get me wrong, I am not saying I am convinced by the orthodox position either but I certainly don’t feel like what Vatican I says is a slam dunk case. 

3-the abuses. It’s not even that the abuse happened, it’s the response from the bishops and from Rome. WAY more leaders in church had to have known than got in trouble. Or at least had a good idea of what was going on. For example why weren’t the reforms out in place after the “summer of shame” not out in place after the 2006 revelations? And please drop the line of “the church is under attack!”. No, the bishops keep shooting themselves in the foot both a belt-fed machine gun. Not everything is a Masonic conspiracy.

The French thinker Rene Girard who recently died has been called by Bishop Robert Baron a 21st Century - Church Father .... Why is he important and what did he say?,TJB74,1625396411," 

* His central idea was that human motivation is based on desire and that we seek things in life based on what other people want. Our copying of others desires, he termed *mimesis*, and this desire is therefore *mimetic desire*. This mimetic desire becomes *mimetic rivalry* as we become more and more conscious of belonging to a larger and more complex group, whether it be family, then school and then society. 
* According to Girard, all conflict, competition and rivalry in society originate in mimetic desire and this can escalate into conflict between individuals and wider groups. In order to control this violence, we have to repress it and society is required to blame someone or something in order to defuse conflict. This is what Girard called the scapegoat mechanism. 
* The primitive religions and mythologies directed the scapegoat impulse onto a variety of things and so was a way of containing this violence
* In his book  *In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World*, he argues the Biblical Stories are an essential instrument of cohesion to end the practice of human sacrifice through replacing the behaviour triggered by scapegoat mechanism with ritual. 
* The unique and radical think about Jesus in the Gospels is an account of a victim-God condemned by a unanimous crowd, an event that is then commemorated by Christians through ritual sacrifice — for Catholics and Orthodox, a material re-presentation in the Eucharist. 
* Therefore the ""good news"" of the Gospels, is it the beginning of the destruction of the sacrificial order on which rests the equilibrium of societies. The true God is far removed from violence, whereas false gods that sanction violence are idols. By revealing how human violence works, Girard claims, the Bible reveals that this violence does not come from God; rather, God sympathizes with victims. God is incarnate in the person of Jesus, in order to become himself a victim.

I find that I can remember bits and pieces of what I've read, but often it seems to just go in and quickly fall out. For example, I read entries in the Imitation of Christ during adoration, which I find at the time, but the next day I could probably tell you very few specifics of what it says, and every chapter is so similar that they all just blend together.

I'd like to start some of Ratzinger's theology, but when I flip through and see very pithy observations and things, I feel discouraged because I know I won't be able to remember or repeat a tenth of it after finishing it, and the chance of sitting down and reading it again is probably never going to happen. I kind of feel like I'm reading a stock ticker, with heaps of valuable stuff going past, but it's difficult to catch most of it. I've read a lot of books, but sometimes when the time comes to discuss them with others, I remember so little that I don't feel like I've read them properly.

I really need some help.,EvilSimplicity,1625391387,"Hi everyone.  So I (22m) am a lapsed Catholic and have been extremely against religion for two years or so now.  I am a porn addict.  I say a lot of horrible things about people.  I objectify women.  The list goes on.  I honestly hate myself and who I am.  I have no control over my urges and give in to them straight away.  

I don't believe in God but I desperately want to.  I want to feel like im being heard by somebody because I can't talk to my family about how I am feeling or what I am doing.  I have so many questions about God and a lot of those questions are the ones that make me not believe in him.  But then there are other questions I have which do make me believe in him.  I am so confused and I don't know what to think.  Please don't take this as a pity post.  I am a very privileged and lucky person it's just that I am also a not so great person as well. 

I guess the point of this post was to kind of rant a little and to ask if there are any resources you guys could provide that would help me expand my knowledge of God and Catholicism?  To help answer some of the questions I have on my mind.  Thank you.",Catholicism

Help me stay Catholic,kilted2000,1625379071,"I’m in need of some advice. With all the scandals involving the Church, such as the pedophile priests coverup and the Canadian residential schools, and what I see as a lack of humility from the institutional church, I’m thinking of becoming Episcopalian.  By lack of humility, I mean something like the bishop of Winnipeg saying that the church was being persecuted about the residential schools. It’s not being persecuted, it’s being called to account, although the church burnings are terrible as well. I know that the Church has always had bad people in it, and we are all sinners, but I’m tired of being Catholic in spite of various things. It’s not any one thing that has me feeling this way, it’s a cumulative effect. I’m pro life, believe in the Real Presence of the Eucharist, I go to mass, I pray but I don’t think I can be Catholic anymore. Part of the problem is that I’m also tired of being a cafeteria Catholic. I’ve tried to believe in all the Churches teachings but I can’t believe, as hard as I’ve tried, that a loving same sex relationship is a sin. There are other examples, but I don’t want to get sidetracked. The Anglican Communion claims to have apostolic succession and they believe in the Real Presence as well. I know the Church has declared their holy orders invalid, I don’t really buy the reasons given. The main reason seems to be because “we” say so.

My opinion of why it is not possible for transsexuals to have the sex they claim to have,Ambitious_Ad_8339,1625368438," ""Whether a hermaphrodite may witness a testament depends on which sex prevails."" - Decretum Gratiani (12th century)

""If someone has a beard, wants to always act like a man and not a woman, and always wants to be in the company of men and not women, it is a sign that the male sex prevails in him and then he can be a witness, where a woman is not allowed."" - Huguccio of Pisa (died 1210)

""If, therefore, a person is more inclined towards the feminine than the masculine, the person cannot receive the sacrament of orders."" - Huguccio of Pisa (died 1210)

""A hermaphrodite is classified as male or female according to the predominance of sexual organs."" - Henry Bretton (c. 1210 – c. 1268)

A) If a ""trans woman"" has more masculine characteristics than feminine characteristics, then ""she"" is a man, not a woman. A being that has more characteristics of a dog than a cat is a dog or a cat? Obviously it is a dog, because the idea that a being that has more characteristics of X is Y just because it identifies itself as Y is simply incoherent. It's a complete attack on physical reality and it's a level of incoherence similar to 2 + 2 = 5; it is pure contradiction of terms.

B) How to check if a ""trans woman"" is a real man or a real woman? An useful thought experiment is this: at the end of times, God will resurrect in perfect bodies those who are in Heaven, that is, the person who died blind, for example, will have his body resurrected with functional eyes; God will make the necessary changes to the resurrected body for it to be perfect and will also resurrect you as a real man or real woman according to what your body truly was on Earth. Now, what will require more work on God's part: altering certain brain structures so that a person can identify with the physical characteristics of a large part of their body, or altering a lot of parts of his body to make it fit a troubled brain? The latter will require more work from God, which means that the trans woman, for example, has more masculine characteristics than feminine, which makes her a man in reality.

C) It is incorrect to say that a person who, initially having more masculine characteristics and therefore being a real man, after performing several procedures that removed many of these masculine characteristics has become a real woman. This is incorrect because it is not possible for a man to remove all his male characteristics (there is no way for him to remove all his male chromosomes, for example), so this statement is similar to saying that a person is dead, even though he still has vitality in the body : A person may be almost dead, with almost no vitality in the body, but to be dead while keeping some life in your body is simply a contradiction of terms. A person who was initially a real man cannot later become a real woman if he has any masculine trait and, again, being almost dead doesn't make you a corpse, because you still have life in the body.

Even if in a distant future it is possible to eliminate all physical/material masculine characteristics from your body, there will still be masculine characteristics in your soul (paragraph 2333 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church) and I am pretty that it is beyond human capacity to be able to change the nature of the soul, so a person will never be able to actually change sex. But in the end it is not necessary to appeal to this soul argument while it is not possible to eliminate all the physical/material male characteristics of a body, something that may very well be impossible, which may very well be something beyond human capacity.

D) What about people who are composed of 50% male characteristics and 50% female characteristics? Assuming that God does not prevent the existence of this type of person, I would say that this person would be both male and female, just as Jesus is both God and human. If a man had sex with such person, he would be committing the sin of homosexual practice, but also would not be; due to the female nature of this individual he would not be committing a sin, but due to the male nature of the individual he would at the same time be committing a sin, after all the individual is a woman AND IS ALSO a man, so I would say that such person would not be able to marry, enter the priesthood etc. To have sex with such person is to have sex with a man and a woman at the same time, just as hypothetically having sex with Jesus would be having sex with a human and a deity at the same time.",Catholicism
Fascination with demons,BeautifulGenius10,1625368281,"I know demons are evil and they're not like the demons in fiction but I often feel like demons are better than humans and often feel like I'd rather spend time with demons than with humans.

Humans are so shallow, always judging based on superficial criteria, and stupid.

Demons are fallen angels, and as such, I feel that they are much superior to humans in many ways.

I heard St. Catherine said even demons cannot stand the sight of some of the things that humans do.

And when I read the Third Spiritual Alphabet and how demons tricked and tempted humans, my thought was the demons must be really, really deep and smart to think up all those things, like when humans are obsessed with superficial things, demons make use of that to lure humans to hell.

I heard in hell, demons rule over humans, which I think is fair considering how demons are so superior to humans in so many ways.

In some ways I even admire demons, I think they have numerous good qualities that humans lack and humans have a lot to learn from demons in a way.

I often feel like I'd learn and grow more from being around demons than from being around humans. Although demons probably incite people to think and act evil, so in a way, dealing with humans could be indirectly dealing with demons. But I don't feel that demons ever directly harmed me. Maybe they used some other medium like humans to harm me, but it was always humans doing stupid, evil things.",Catholicism

Question in which I’ve been given mixed answers.,DependentShirt8089,1625366678,"I am inclined (meaning I naturally feel) towards having feelings of jealousy towards some people and in coveting (wanting things I cannot have) other people.  

These feelings are very strong in that sometimes I feel I want to hold onto them or they are holding onto me.  In my prayer (or action) I say, “Lord let your will be done, I know I feel strongly about these things but let your will be done not mine”.  Even after these prayers I still feel attached to these things.

Now my question:  Are these feelings in themselves sinful?

I have been told they are and that I have a serious problem.  I’m not sure how that’s the case if they are feelings.  I pray the Lords will is done, I give him these issues and completely deny myself in prayer.  And if I still have the persistent feelings how is this my fault?  Also I don’t let the jealousy or coveting make me rude or act in a wrong way towards others.  It’s all internal.

Second question:  is it ok to cry out in anger and pain at our Lord in some of my prayers about how I feel for not having this or why I ended up with that?

Reception of Communion,CounterfeitXKCD,1625365037,"I recently saw a post on r/orthodoxy about this topic, and in the comments, they said that only Orthodox Christians may receive Communion.

Also, may an Orthodox Christian receive at a Catholic Mass? From what I know, it's restricted to only Catholics.

Y’all have a monster growing in your garden,snokamel,1625364000,"First, I am not Catholic, nor do I have opinions about the modern faith. It’s wonderful that you have this religion and community, and this sub seems to be friendly and reasonable.

In my day job as a left-libertarian organizer and community-defense-oriented tactical instructor, I’ve noticed a growing trend among the opposition- identification with the “trad” strain of Catholicism. There’s a theme of the crusades being “based”, of violent hatred towards LGBTQ+, Jews, and democracy, and of Trad Catholicism as the penultimate expression of White/ West supremacy. 

You may be tempted to write this off as 4chan incel groyper trolling, but as we have all seen, the boundaries between the internet and the real world are increasingly porous. 

While the existence and growth of these trad-fascist tendencies is a great recruiting tool for my group and certainly motivates me to get my reps in every day, it’s going to be a huge problem for Catholicism.

Who can we talk to and when? I am assuming it would have to be with someone you trust. This is a difficult teaching for me because I feel like I have resolved a lot of issues by expressing my discontent with others.

This ended up working well and led me to be a much happier person.

I've got genuine questions and doubts that I'd appreciate any assistance with.,SunsetAbydos,1625349141,"I was baptized Catholic at a young age, confirmed at like 13- which looking back was far too early as i had a limited understanding of what it meant- and was blessed with catholic education throughout elementary and highschool. I've read and studied many Catholics thinkers, Aquinas, JPII, John XXIII, Saint Augustine, GK Chesterton, and more. But I have problems believing most all of it anymore. The closest I've ever genuinely gotten was agnosticism, i still believe there is a god in the sense of a creater of the universe, and that by their design there are means to operate within the world and fulfill ones nature within it. These beliefs have been tested and reinforced by my passion for philosophy and trying to come to a better understanding of reality and one's place in the Universe.
My problem is that for some reason i just can't commit fully, im aware of Paschal's Wager and the potential consequences of my doubts, as well as Mark 16:16. I have my doubts about the church, i know it's comprised of men so it will ultimately be flawed- even with the help of divine intervention, God cannot do everything for us and cannot make us freely choose the good.
I've had my own personal moral issues (of the pornography variety) that im struggling through but even through it I've been able to debate between this.

I feel for the First Nations, I do. That being said, it's upsetting the way this has been covered.

Some quotes from the above article:

* ""They can still pray at home in silence. That would send a strong message,"" Cameron said.
* ""We need more champions. The greatest champions on this can be the congregation. This is something they can do, show that solidarity and not show up for church on Sunday,"" Thomas said last month.
* Okanagan Indian Band Chief Byron Louis said the boycott message ""would get up to the bishops, the archbishops and then up, up, up through the layers.""
* Louis said it's upsetting that church officials are claiming they don't have money for survivors while they build and renovate churches across Canada. ""Is that what Jesus would do?"" he said.

Many of us have seen the multiple churches burning. 10 churches in Alberta were vandalized on Canada Day. Boycotting Sunday mass? We don't and cannot ""pray at home in silence"". It's not how our Sunday mass works.

When there are other attacks and burnings of places of worship, people say ""it's not the whole population, it's just a few bad apples"". Communities rally behind those communities. They contribute to GoFundMes with millions of dollars to rebuild. Are they encouraged to not go to pray to boycott? But here, there's rampant anti-Catholicism. We don't say things to other people like you're being ""phobic"" towards our religion if they make these remarks.

Eucharistic sacrilege and the harm of the option,ProLifeCatholic1535,1625333657,"http://pitt.edu/~mthompso/readings/velleman_euthanasia.pdf

One very strong secular argument against euthanasia is that sometimes, giving people an option can be harmful to them, even if we assume they are infallible and always make the correct choice (not true, but hold with me here):

If a union leader knows that his workers will not accept a pay cut, his lack of an option to accept that pay cut strengthens his negotiating position.

If a store clerk does not know how to open his safe, he will be less likely to be the target of a robbery.

If you receive an invitation to go to a dinner party that you do not want to go to, to not go, you have to decline it and potentially be embarrassed. The option robs you of the ability to be absent by default.

And lastly, as applied to euthanasia, the option of being euthanized will make many people who otherwise would not want to die choose to do so. If a terminally ill person has the option to be legally euthanized, perhaps his friends and family, the government, etc will wonder why he hasn't done so? It costs a lot of money to stay alive after all. He is robbed of the ability to stay alive by default. He may have to actively justify his life, or think he may have to actively justify his life, even if he doesn't, to those who wonder why he hasn't chosen euthanasia.

I think most Catholics would agree that this is a strong argument against euthanasia, which we are all called to be against.


I would like to take a minute to apply this same argument to the current system of eucharistic reception, which I think is highly flawed:

Let's first think about the state of western communion reception: It is obvious that there is a ton of sacrilege being committed. Polls show most Catholics commit grave sins on the regular, confession lines are often empty, no one goes to confession, and yet, nearly every mass attendee receives communion every Sunday. It is obvious that there is a lot of sacrilege being committed. Now please don't argue: ""Well, they could've gone to communion at another parish! They might not have grave sins! Don't judge others!"" because I'm not actually judging others. I don't assume that any single person who goes up is committing sacrilege, because again, I don't know what's on their heart. However, it's obvious from the facts I stated earlier that many people *are* committing sacrilege. I don't know who they are, and it's not my responsibility to find out who is, but you'd have to do some serious mental gymnastics to think that it is not happening.


Now let's think about the current system of communion reception for a second: The priest invites everyone to come up to receive communion, people stand in a line, and one by one, they receive. The Priest is essentially providing the entire parish with an option to receive communion. You have to explicitly accept or decline that option. Now think about this scenario from the point of view of someone who knows they are not in a state of grace: If they accept, they commit sacrilege, if they decline either by crossing their arms or by staying in their pew, they have actively declined the eucharist in a public way, which they may believe signals to everyone else that they are not in a state of grace and have done something bad: An extremely embarrassing proposition, especially for the youth like teenagers. Now this is *NOT* to suggest that it is okay for these people to receive the eucharist because of the embarrassment. Despite the potential embarrassment, the first priority is Jesus Christ, and not trampling on Him. They should endure the embarrassment to receive. But the fact is that many people are not strong enough to do this, and it's our responsibility to help them out, just like it's our responsibility to care for Jesus. If a young man with strong desires is openly offered the option to watch porn every day, he still should say no, but we should also stop offering him the option in the first place.

Basically, I think that the current system of communion where everyone is basically explicitly offered an option to commune is extremely imprudent, and basically the equivalent of accidentally offering a grave sinner the temptation to sin every day. It is not working out at all, and changes need to be made so that parishioners are less explicitly offered the option to commune. I don't particularly know the best solution, I've heard it's different in Mediterranean countries where people go up to the altar rail in a big blob and put their hands out. That sounds a bit better so those not in a state of grace can sit in the back and covertly not receive and perhaps just say a prayer. I also don't know if this is allowed, but I think if it is, a great solution would be for only the priest to receive communion during the mass, but mention that if you want to receive communion, after mass you can come up to him individually and receive. If that is possible, that would also be a lot better. Lastly, I definitely think we should offer more confessions.

But while I don't pretend to know the best solution, I am very confident in my belief that the current system is horrendous, and is causing extreme amounts of sacrilege. While people are still responsible for their actions and should not commit sacrilege, we are still obligated to help the weak-willed among us not sin, and this system does a horrible job at that.",Catholicism

Ladies church group advice,candywandytandy,1625332112,"Hello, all!

I’m posting in hopes for help with a ladies group that I help with. My question is simple but not easy.

Recently our leadership has resigned and in doing so, dismantled the foundations of the group. They removed the positions of president, Vice President, secretary, and a few others in an attempt to more evenly distribute the work, but in doing so they have removed accountability and responsibility. Myself and a few other women have stepped up to be “leadership” but there are no static responsibilities and we haven’t been given the previous club charter/rules. 

Unfortunately at this time our parish priest has just been placed with us and is still getting his feet under him, so I feel we should do our best to cobble together leadership before asking him to intervene, but at the same time the ladies who have decided to stay are at odds with how I think the group should be maintained.

The complaints of the previous president etc were that they had to do all the work and that it was stressful. Their solution was to give no one a job or responsibilities, and the “new team” can renegotiate jobs at every meeting according to their whims? Other obligations? How they feel that day? 

And yet, they expect the group to go on as before, with all the fun events that they had to run but not enjoy. 

I had been very vocal about wanting to step into the President role and doing my best to keep the group going. I am new to the parish and had not yet attended any pre-covid meetings. I can understand their reluctances, however in an effort to preserve at all costs their nostalgia of previous years, they have severely undercut anyone’s ability to move the group forward.

This group has been worried about getting younger members but does not want to host events that would appeal to them. And actively fights anything that is not mostly secular “fun”.

I guess, tldr; I wanted to pull this group up to a place all ages could enjoy but the past leadership has crippled it on the way out. Should I try to work with them or ask our priest for help?",Catholicism

And when we went to church last week, they all received communion but haven’t been to confession in years.

Catholic Opposition to the Briggs Initiative and What it Can Tell Us Now,ThrowThisAway2k21,1625322759,"California Proposition 6, better known as the Briggs Initiative, was a 1978 ballot initiative which sought to effectively ban homosexual teachers from working in California public schools. Modeled after the infamous ""Save our Children"" campaign of Anita Bryant and inspired by similar bans imposed in Oklahoma and Arkansas, the proposition would ban "" ""the advocating, soliciting, imposing, encouraging or promoting"" of homosexuality among schoolchildren.

Named after its sponsor, conservative Republican state legislator John Briggs, the logic behind the initiative was based on the false belief that having homosexual teachers would cause their students to engage in homosexual activities. Proposition 6 was opposed by the openly gay San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk, former President Gerald Ford, then current President Jimmy Carter, former governor and prospective presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, and then current governor Jerry Brown, and after having a large lead in the polls at the beginning the proposition would fail by a large margin on election day.

Another factor in the initiative's defeat was the strong opposition from Catholic clergy and lay people. Archbishop John Quinn of San Francisco, Bishop John Cummins of Oakland, and Bishop Juan Arzube of Los Angeles derided Proposition 6 for being ""perilously vague,"" for harming the ""freedom of teachers, whether homosexual or heterosexual,"" and for allowing teachers to be fired ""merely on the basis that they are known to be homosexuals."" Additionally, a brochure would be signed by dozens of priests, religious, and lay people who declared that there was already ""ample laws to protect school children from the undue influence of teachers regarding sexuality"" and that the Briggs Initiative would be a ""clear violation of human rights"".

The approach of clergy like Archbishop John Quinn and his contemporary in Cardinal Bernardin serve as a largely forgotten but fascinating position. Archbishop Quinn was long known for applying Church teachings to social issues, advocating for an end to nuclear weapons and sanctuary for Latin American refugees, along with opposing Roe v. Wade and supporting the Church's prohibition on contraception. Quinn was an early and passionate advocate for reaching out to the LGBT community, directing priests to meet the concerns of gay people and initiating an effective response to the AIDS epidemic, which drew a visit from Pope John Paul II in 1985.

Cardinal Bernardin took a similar approach. He spent his career adhering to Church teaching on sexual morality, being a public figure in the fight against pornography as well as opposing city ordinances if he felt they threatened religious liberty. However, he was also supportive of gay Catholics within his diocese and often met with groups and organizations that represented that community.

I think their examples shows a path that allows for an upholding and defense of the Church teaching's on morality within public life, while also recognizing the dignity and needs of disparate communities. It's an approach that goes beyond culture wars, partisan politics, and politicking that has exemplified recent developments, such as Hungary's ban on ""homosexual resources"" in education. Why must we almost always default to ""us vs them"" when everyone are children of God? Is it not possible for us to support the Church's position on sexuality, marriage, and the family while also protecting the LGBT community from unjust discrimination and attacks on their civil rights? I don't think it is.

We Need to Talk about “The Church”,PaterPadraig,1625290240,"Hello,

Something’s been running through my mind when we talk about “the church”, and that is mainly that it is never clear what someone means when they say it.

From what I understand, when people say the church, they mean:

1: The unerring institution founded by Jesus Christ

2: All Catholics, from Pope to laity

3: People in charge, Popes and Bishops 

4: The teachings of the Church

There isn’t often confusion when taking about this to other Catholics, at least on this sub, however when communicating with others it often becomes confusing, especially with the matter of scandals. I think we need to rethink our approach to the language we use, especially when talking about wrongdoings. I know many great reforms that have taken place, such as The Dallas Charter and Vos Estis.

I say this because I see saying that “The Church hasn’t sinned” when in reference to a wrongdoing. I know their using definition #1 to talk about this, however, the person they are taking with may not. It often ends up with, “it was just individuals who did bad”, which to an outsider easily comes off as deflection or avoiding how the wrongdoing perpetuated itself.

We should use different words to describe these so that we can speak much more clearly when discussing important and heavy matters

The Church - this would be best used for #1 and often #4

Episcopacy - for #3 - this would clearly describe things that are institutional in nature without attaching itself to #1, Leadership when the discussion is too far away from bishops

The Laity/Faithful - #2 - normally this one is clear in discussion.

Mainly, I am concerned about it appearing that we don’t acknowledge the true moral failings of the “The Church”, even though on our end it is a near definitional technically. I think using “episcopacy” or other similar clear words would help us discuss more clearly about sin that had rooted itself beyond just individuals.

Priests and Ambulances? A Question of Priestly Blessing.,the_Blind_Samurai,1625287773,"I've spent a number of years as an EMT and many of those have been volunteer.

Before the ambulance would leave our priest would always pause mass, come out to the parking lot, lay hands upon the ambulance and pray; and after a moment would go right back to mass without even skipping a beat. 

I always greatly admired that and I've been wondering lately whether that was his personal choice or whether there is some greater guidance priests follow when a parishioner requires emergency care during mass.

Now, I understand that we shouldn’t follow God merely out of fear; that’s just not healthy, both mentally and spiritually. So how should I focus more on Perfect Contrition, and following God solely out of desire to be with Him? And maybe to not be as scared of Purgatory anyway too?

Canadian Catholics,Thirdnipple79,1625284720,"I know this is a hot topic so I don't expect everyone to agree on this, but I feel that it needs to be discussed.

It has been a difficult time.  There are a lot of people that have been hurt by the residential school system.  I am not going to go into how hurt they have been because I really have no way to understand.  I can empathize based on what I know, but I did not live through the same suffering, so I cannot fully understand.  I am sorry for what happened. 

At the same time, watching churches burn and be vandalized hurts a lot.  While there have been many terrible things done in the past, it's not ok to burn down places of worship.  The people who attend the churches and the community there are not responsible for the terrible things that have happened at residential schools.  If there are individuals that were responsible for abuses then they do need to be held accountable.  But the vast majority of Catholics wish now harm on other people and are willing to help and to do what they can for our indigenous brothers and sisters. 


As difficult as it is though, I think as Catholics it is important for us to understand that there is a lot of anger about what happened.  I think it's important for us to stop the cycle of anger and hate.  Even though this is difficult, we need to follow the example of Jesus and turn the other cheek.  Instead of being angry about the burning churches we should focus on listening to our indigenous brothers and sisters and let them know that we love them and want to do what we can to reconcile what has happened.  We cannot focus on being angry.  Instead of asking what we should do about arson and vandalism we need to ask what can we do to help make things right.  We need to be examples of God's Love if we want the cycle of anger and hate to end.

Will I be forgiven? I am terrified right now.,CringeInWords,1625284632,"Hi, I am a 21F Roman Catholic from India. I do love and believe in God. However, I have OCD. Over the past 2 months, my OCD got very bad and I became depressed and I started getting mad at God. I used to pray everyday and I thought I was always doing the right thing but apparently I wasn't because my ocd latched on to some past mistakes I've made. I got angry at God and I used swear words at him, I might've shown him the finger and i said some stuff about how  I don't believe in him etc. A few times. I was mainly angry. Inspite saying this stuff, I did pray at night etc. I feel like it is blasphemy against God.

Question for pro-choice Catholics,35quai,1625282085,"I  have lived in Asia for over ten years.  A huge percentage--perhaps  most--of abortions here are for the purposes of sex selection.

This is almost entirely due to Chinese, Hindu, and  Islamic traditions that greatly prefer sons over daughters.

[Free Friday] Papal iconography,coinageFission,1625278902,"More than once in the past I have had the idea of imagining a long series of full length murals, depicting all of the popes throughout history — saints and sinners alike — in a manner inspired by the Fire Lord portraits from ATLA.

Of course that gets me thinking about the specific iconographic attributes we’d have to ascribe to each pontiff in turn, so this is the thread I made for us to share our ideas of what things the popes would be depicted with that best represent what they’re known for or what happened during their reign.

Some of the ideas I’ve had so far:

* Damasus I — a scroll in his hand, bearing the list of the canonical scriptures

* Gregory I — a dove on his shoulder, the plainchant score for the Kyrie in his hand

* Leo III — the imperial crown in his left hand, his right resting on a pair of silver tablets that bear the text of the Creed

* Clement VI — standing between two blazing bonfires, or amidst a ring of burning torches

The post says NOTHING about the abuse indigenous children suffered at the hands of the people running the schools. This sub is complicit in trying to cover up how bad those schools truly were.

I am catholic and it breaks my heart that churches are being burned and that people think the church is an evil institution. This sub is contributing to that. 

This is not the way forward. The Church did those things, it must admit it and ask for forgiveness. (I'm aware there have been previous apologies). 

Just because Church officials did heinous things does not mean out beliefs are wrong. But if we cannot admit the church did wrong, we are hypocrites.

It seems really easy to fall into mortal sin. Am I misunderstanding something?,osteo5511,1625274565,"I have heard many priests talk about how hard it is to fall into mortal sin but as I get more into Catholicism this does not seem to be the case as someone who recently re-converted to Catholicism. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that comes to mind is impure thoughts. I feel like most people have these many times a day. I have made an effort to get rid of these, but it can be really hard. It is really exhausting to be constantly monitoring what you are thinking. 

&amp;#x200B;

After looking through an examination of conscience, I saw that talking poorly about someone can be considered a mortal sin. I tend to vent to my family when people are annoying me so, this is a big issue. I literally went to confession two days ago and think I have to go again because of this today. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to conclude that I am probably constantly falling into mortal sin. This is because so many things can be considered a grave matter that most people do regularly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I even saw that roasting someone can be considered a grave matter because it is considered derision. This is something I love to do and I guess I will have to stop doing it. 

&amp;#x200B;

To make matters worse, when I look on the internet, it seems as if different priests have different opinions on what makes a mortal sin. Some like Father Mike Schmidt make it seem insanely easy to do. Others like the guy from Breaking The Habit make it seem pretty hard.  Honestly, the latter seems to make more sense to me but, I could be wrong. Starting off as a Catholic returning to the Church after a long time gone, I thought something would have to be really serious to send someone to Hell. Examples that come to mind are masturbation, murder, rape, extreme use of drugs, extreme fraud, etc. This does not seem to be the case. On the contrary, everyday actions such as venting, having a single bad thought, and getting angry seem to be enough to send you there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, I am not scandalizing anyone. This would be another sin, but this is starting to get really frustrating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to speak to my confessor today but, any insight would be appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this rate, I feel doomed unless I pass away right after my confession or make some drastic changes to the way I live. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either I have scruples, a misunderstanding of the faith, or am legitimately constantly in deadly sin.

Craziest or horrifying Catholic school stories?,Gold-Vanilla5591,1625262670,"Went to Catholic high school, almost every year had something different:

1. Freshman year. Arrived late to school due to a doctor appointment and saw the cops with dogs. Turns out a senior girl was expelled for having weed in her car that she resold from her brother? (Don’t know if it’s true) That same girl received a DUI in my area 2 years later. 
2. Beginning of freshman year orientation. Some kid peed in a cup and forced everyone to drink it. It was bad enough that he had to talk with the bishop, kid got expelled a week later. 
3. Sophomore year. Freshman with mental health issues (maybe autism or ADHD??) threatened to shoot up the school if the seniors pranked the freshmen. This story was in local news and our security was upgraded ASAP. 
4. Two freshman girls were fighting on the stairs when one girl pushed the other, the other receiving a concussion. The pusher girl was expelled but came back a year later??

Does Acts 10 refute baptismal regeneration?,JamieOfArc,1625262174,"&gt; **44** While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word. **45** And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. **46** For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered, **47** “Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we *have?*” **48** And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. 

This is Acts 10. It says that these people already had the holy spirit before they were baptised. The doctrine of baptismal regeneration that the catholic church holds on to (and also lutherans and orthodox) teaches that baptism is part of salvation and necessary for salvation (even though they might be exceptions for people who werent able to get baptised like the repenting thief on the cross). However, werent these people already saved when they had received the holy spirit? 

Could a possible explanation for this be that salvation in catholic doctrine is a process and not an event like evangelicals often believe? So their salvation process had already started with receiving the holy spirit and then water baptism was the next step on their path? Would they lose the holy spirit again when they refuse to get baptised after they believed?

I haven't been neglecting my religious duties such as prayer, devotion, and reading scripture, per se, but I have been somewhat disinterested them due to the obsession and am more interested in getting back to the activity. It also occasionally causes me to neglect earthly work (mainly tasks I've set up for my own good). I assume it's likely a temporary obsession that will wear off as the initial excitement passes, but I still want to know if I should take a break or give it up altogether, seeing as I've been feeling guilty but find it difficult to quit.

I waited for about thirty minutes and then left when it became clear he wasn’t coming. 

I don’t know what it is but I just feel incredibly discouraged by this. I know he didn’t do it out of malice, he did say he had some things to take care of that morning before hearing my confession in the afternoon, but I can’t keep myself from feeling somewhat rejected. Rejection is definitely what I’m feeling, both from the priest and from God. Doesn’t He want my sins to be washed away? I’m confused and several times I’ve wondered if it wouldn’t be altogether easier to just go back to Protestantism. It’s not the first time something like this has happened, but it always makes me feel extra lonely. On top of that, my family is Protestant and doesn’t understand why I’m discouraged by this, because in their minds the Sacrament of Penance makes no sense—which just further exacerbates those thoughts I’m having about leaving the Church.

Help,vscarywoomy,1625243991,"I feel so lost. I’ve fallen so deeply into sin. I am struggling as a Catholic and as a person. I don’t seek God, praying is a struggle, I don’t love Him like I should. I sin even though I fear judgement and hell, and I know I should stop committing these sins, but I can’t. I feel trapped in this awful cycle of sin, but I feel no regret because it hurts Him, but because I’m scared of punishment, and even then I don’t feel anything anymore. I wear a scapular, but I feel like I’ve been condemned and don’t trust in our Lady’s promise. I want to be happy, I want to love God and have that relationship, but just can’t find it in my heart to do so. Church and prayer seem like chores. I am jealous of how happy other Christians seem to be, and how they love and desire the Lord. I’m envious of that, because when I actually make the effort to pray, I feel closed off. My heart feels closed off, like I physically feel the lack of connection. I’m scared of being stuck in this cycle forever, of never knowing what it is like to love and trust God with all of my heart. I struggle with depression and just wish I could hug Him, hold Him, hear Him say He loves me, but all I feel is pain from being so separated and unhappy. I feel like I’m just pretending, like I’m a fraud when I go to church because the only things that make me feel Catholic are the chores of receiving the sacraments and going to church on Sundays.",Catholicism
Why does the Church stand against self-castration?,Iromhiaesiarp,1625243414,"Was brushing up on some Patristics when I stumbled upon an article detailing why Origen wasn't canonised as a saint, much less a Church Father in some circles:

So, apart from his apparent support of Apocatastasis, I found that his alleged self-castration seemed to have affected his reputation **greatly.**

Much more than I would have imagined.

I mean, I understand the ""*your body is a temple""* and *""God created us in His image""* thing, but then again we allow self-mortification and the vow of celibacy as a means to offer some measure of our sacrifices to Christ. So, why can't the same be said for self-castration? I have a hunch it has to do with the possibility of spiritual pride, but I'm not too sure.",Catholicism

Why are the Luminous Mysteries prayed on Thursday?,paxdei_42,1625243152,"After having read ""The Secret of the Rosary"" by Saint Louis-Marie de Monfort, I was inspired to pray a whole Rosary a day, instead of the five decades I used to. I only prayed the divinely revealed Rosary (the original 15 decades) because of the symbolism described in the book and the fact that it was given to Saint Dominic as such. However, after a time of praying like this, I stopped really *praying* the Rosary and fell into a dry recitation of it because of the habit I had formed. I thought it'd be good to dial back a bit and pray again five decades a day. Now I could also pick up the Luminous Mysteries up again. However, I find that it is really awkwardly placed in the middle of a rotation of Joyful - Sorrowful - Glorious. Why wasn't it placed on Sundays in Ordinary Time (to contast with the Joyful in Advent, the Sorrowful in Lent and the Glorious in Eastertide)? Do you also think praying the Luminous Mysteries on Thursday disrupts the 'flow' of the Rosary? If so, do you pray them on Sundays or not at all?",Catholicism

Spiritual warfare or superstition?,Gjak_Illir,1625242738,"Having  a bit of conflict in the faith.

Always thought that was dumb, still do. But I saw a talk by an exorcist priest and it seems to reinforce these ideas

He  talks about generational spirits where the sins of a family member  affect generations down the line as well as their families , like is  this a real thing considering we actually have a Bible quote  specifically laying out that we are not responsible for the sins of our  father.

Then it gets weirder where  apparently objects can be cursed, to never accept anything from someone  who practices the occult, and apparently humans can now place actual  hexes and spells on others that work - and that all confirms the  “superstitions” of my culture that always saw as contrary to the faith

"If Objective Morality exists doesn't that mean that we should judge historical figures with the same morality we judge people today? Because things like slavery, theft, racism etc... are inherently wrong?",MrMcGoofy03,1625239462,"Before I get into this I just want to say I do indeed believe in objective morality. I'm not really looking to discuss whether objective morality exists, I am more interested in discussing the implications of objective morality existing.

For example some relativists say ""people who worked at Nazi concentration camps were products of their times and were following orders.""

But plenty of people would counter that by saying ""as human beings they should have been able to realize that what they were doing was wrong.""

So if objective morality exists then don't most historical figures not have much of an excuse for the actions they committed? As it should have been inherent to them that what they were doing was wrong? And saying ""they were a product of their time"" is essentially affirming moral relativism?

Catholics need to speak out against gain of function research,Camero466,1625238728,"Please put aside for the moment the lab leak hypothesis for coronavirus. I want to talk about something that has been overlooked in that whole conversation, and is actually more important: namely, the fact that many countries are doing gain of function research *at all* and *essentially no one considers it unusual or worthy of comment.* 

Gain of function research, as I understand it, involves trying to modify viruses to make them deadlier and/or more infectious. 

Ostensibly the purpose of this research is to help us practice dealing with mutations and variants and what-not, but the military application of this is so blindingly obvious that I wonder if this is even sincere. It sort of doesn’t matter if it is: the research objectively means making viral weapons. It would be as though we were breeding super soldiers purely for the purpose of “training exercises” for regular soldiers. 

Just as nuclear weapons are immoral because it is not really possible to fire them without including innocents in the blast radius, so too would viral weapons be intrinsically immoral; in fact, they’d be more so. They don’t even have a “blast radius.” There seems no real reason to use them *except because* they guarantee harm to the general population, not just combatants.

The fact that this sort of research is just kind of happening and no one in these communities seems to be even consider it worth remarking on, is alarming. We ought to be openly speaking out against this as a Church.

"[Free Friday] Ok here me out, but…aliens",sonofdurinwastaken,1625236429,"tl;dr: Aliens may be walking among us and, if they are, we wouldn’t even notice. 

So, let’s start out with some assumptions. 

Assumption #1: God created all. 

This is affirmed in numerous places, namely in the book of Genesis, both the Nicene and Apostle’s Creeds, in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) in paragraphs 279-324, and numerous other places. 

“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” Genesis 1:1

“Creation is the foundation of ""all God's saving plans,"" the ""beginning of the history of salvation""that culminates in Christ.” CCC 280

“Human intelligence is surely already capable of finding a response to the question of origins. The existence of God the Creator can be known with certainty through his works, by the light of human reason, even if this knowledge is often obscured and disfigured by error. This is why faith comes to confirm and enlighten reason in the correct understanding of this truth: ""By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made out of things which do not appear."" CCC 286

Assumption #2: God is still creating. 

Scientific evidence tells us that new galaxies are still being formed, as observed by NASA’s Galaxy Evolution Explorer:

“We knew there were really massive young galaxies eons ago, but we thought they had all matured into older ones more like our Milky Way. If these galaxies are indeed newly formed, then this implies parts of the universe are still hotbeds of galaxy birth,” said Dr. Chris Martin. He is principal investigator for the Galaxy Evolution Explorer.”

“Now we can study the ancestors to galaxies much like our Milky Way in much more detail than ever before,” Heckman said. “It’s like finding a living fossil in your own backyard. We thought this type of galaxy had gone extinct, but in fact newborn galaxies are alive and well in the universe.” 

With Hubbles Constant, we can also - roughly - calculate the rate at which the universe is expanding. In 2018, the Constant was calculated that galaxies move away from the Milky Way at a rate of 46,200 mph, per million light years. I understand that to mean that for every million light years you get away from the Milky Way, the speed increases at the same interval. Ex: two million light years away, the universe is expanding at 92,400 mph. The beauty of science is that it allows us to observe the creative acts of God in a close and profound way. Science and Faith are good buddies. We also know that there were over 70 new animal species discovered in 2019. 

Sure, it would be easy to reason that these species and galaxies always existed and that we are just now discovering them, but the converse can also be true; that they are new creations. 

Tolkien also tells us in his poem *Mythopoeia* that 

“We make still by the law in which we're made.” 

And, 

“In Paradise they look no more awry;
and though they make anew, they make no lie.
Be sure they still will make, not being dead”

The reason that we as humans still create new things is because we follow the nature of our Creator

Based on these assumptions, as well as the knowledge that God creates life in order to give and receive love, we can reason that God has created other planets that can sustain life, including human(oid) life. If we then take the line from Genesis, “Let Us create man in *Our own image*,” it is reasonable that humans created on other planets would be indistinguishable from us humans on earth. Therefore, they could walk past us on the sidewalk and we would never know they weren’t from Earth.

Ver. 34.  That he would depart from their coasts.  S. Jerom thinks these people did this out of a motive of humility, looking upon themselves unworthy of his presence: others judge that the loss of the swine made them apprehend lest Christ, being a Jew, might do them greater damages.  **Wi.**

&gt; --- The fear lest his presence might cause them some fresh loss, seems to have overbalanced, in their estimation, the advantages they might have expected from his visit.  **V.**

&gt; --- How often has our good Lord wished to visit us, to honour us with his sacred presence, to enrich us with his divine inspirations; and how often, like these Gerasens, have we desired him to depart from our territories?  Some worldly interest, sensual enjoyment, or supine listlessness on our part, has occasioned us to neglect the proffered advantages.  Oh!  can there be more marked ingratitude than this!  Oh!  how shall we one day grieve for having lost, by our culpable indifference, immense spiritual treasures, which have been made over to others far more deserving than ourselves!  Yes, the day will certainly arrive, when we shall value a single additional degree of the divine favor and grace, infinitely more than all the united honours, riches, and pleasures of this world.  **A.**",Catholicism

Question: Rosary Part II,Jesus4Forever,1625194917,"So the prayer book I just bought consists of a scriptural rosary for the holy souls in purgatory. I focusing on one mystery at a time until I get the hang of it. I am first starting with the sorrowful mysteries. The first mystery, as you guys may know, is the agony of the garden. The book says the fruit of this mystery is: fervor in prayer. Though some of the scripture doesn't match well with the fruit. I want to meditate on scripture verses but I can not pinpoint how it could match with the fruit of the mystery.

Like for instance for the second hail mary of the first mystery, we have this scripture:

""The cords of Sheol entangled me, / the snares of death confronted me."" - 2 Samuel 22:6

or after the 8th hail mary of that mystery:

""You yourselves know well that  the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night"" - 1 Thessalonians 5:2

The person who wrote this book got an apostolic blessing from Pope John II for her work for the holy souls in purgatory. She surely knows what she is writing about. The scriptures in her book reflect more about purgatory, though I am sure they reflect the fruits somehow. 

I am confused because I want to meditate on these scripture verses but I cant really think on how they could relate to the fruit of the rosary. 

Anyone know how I could meditate on the scriptures from this book. I hope I can get answers. I am probably taking things literal with too many misunderstandings. Please help if you can.",Catholicism
Campaign of Indulgences for the Residential School Students,mg41,1625194406,"Hello Catholic brothers and sisters,

As we are all now painfully aware, there are around 4000 students of residential schools who died under tragic circumstances. The least we can do, and in fact one of the only things we are better equipped to do than the government, is to help bring these souls from the hellish cosmic waiting room of Purgatory into the eternal joy of Heaven, i.e., obtain an indulgence for them. There are 1.7k online right now, and assuming 1/3 are Catholics of good will, we can probably do this within a week.

The why is pretty obvious.

Now, for the how. I propose that when one begins obtaining an indulgence, one will make a post here stating the indulgenced work (and I suppose any particular soul the indulgence is for). Then, when the indulgence is completed, make a followup post, until we reach 5000 posts (perhaps a mod should make a separate post for this effort). To review, the conditions for a plenary indulgence are:

1. Completion of the Indulgenced Work (e.g., praying a Rosary in a group, reading Scripture for thirty minutes, praying for victims of COVID, or reciting the Litany of St. Joseph)
2. Prayers for the Papal Intentions
3. Reception of Communion as soon as possible (due to the COVID situation, usually 20 days before or after; also I have heard that one can obtain two indulgences, one for oneself and one for another from a given reception, though I only have this on pastoral, not Magisterial, authority).
4. Reconciliation and being in a State of Grace at least by the completion of the work (going to Confession once counts for 40 days of indulging, and AFAIK this is also now an ASAP thing rather than a strict thing due to the pandemic exceptions...precise information is at [http://www.penitenzieria.va/](http://www.penitenzieria.va/), though God is not exactly legalistic regardless).
5. Total detachment from all sin (the hardest and an objectively unknowable condition, which actually justifies multiple attempts per soul, though a sincere prayer for detachment from any and all sin suffices for this purpose I think). 

I am sure all FN Catholics  (42% of Canadian indigenous people), if not all FN people, will appreciate the effort at least.

When I first asked my boss a while ago if I needed to report these tips/how I would go about doing so (because I was genuinely unsure) I was told “not to worry about it” and that it “wasn’t a big deal”.

This was many months ago, but I now realize that it would be sinful not to report this income (correct?). I just didn’t because after being told not to worry about, it I didn’t think much of it and I wasn’t sure how I could realistically report this on my taxes. So, two questions:

Am I obligated to keep a record of all these cash tips I receive/like should I just make a tally?

How would you suggest I make restitution/atonement for the wages I didn’t report on my last year’s taxes and ones that I don’t remember how much they amount to up to this point in the year?

Spiritual attacks after praying to Mary?,QuietPrism,1625183575,"So, I'm not Catholic (yet). I'm still discerning that path (between that and Orthodoxy).

But I did start to pray the rosary, perhaps out of curiosity, or to get over those protestant feelings of ""Mariolatry"". I tried doing it more often, in faith, for help with sin, and for the fruits of meditating on the mysteries.

Almost every time now, like a few hours after praying, or a day after, it's like my mood takes a nose-dive. Even saying ""Holy Theotokos, save us"" on my prayer rope triggers it.

I do struggle with major depression, gone untreated for years. I do live in an extremely stressful home environment. So these are factors as well. 

But most of the time, I can distract myself, and set my mood into a neutral state of sorts. 

When I pray to Mary, sometimes I am overcome with this manic rage, suicidal thoughts, intense feelings of hatred/self-hatred.

I have made a decision. I am coming into the Latin Rite of the Church. I felt the need to write this out because it's relavant to Internet Catholicism, and how we do evangelism therein.


I stated before I had problems with iconoclasm, modernism, the filioque, and other issues. Moreover, I expressed a feeling that I wanted to avoid papal authority by being in a rite which he is not directly over. And finally, I felt ashamed of my heritage as a Latin Catholic, given my upbringing as a Brazilian protestant where hatred for Mary, Jesuits and the bishops are engraved into our very souls. This is a self defense mechanism since the whole nation is entirely catholic, and Protestants feel the need to seperate themselves to not be absorbed. 


Oc, these are issues with both myself and the wider church, but somethings helped me accept my place within the Latin Rite. 


**Issues with the Church**


Iconoclasm and modernism are dangerous, and are everywhere in the Church and our world. I was under the impression it's a disease the East has mostly fended off, but clearly not as my own and other's experience can attest to. One way to see this clearly is Michael Lofton's interview on Pints with Aquinas. He can explain it better than me. (I'm pretty sure I'm only allowed one link per post)


Beyond that, things more concrete like sexual abuse and other ills present in the Latin Rite are only evident because of its size and centralization, but are everywhere. Financial corruption, sexual abuse, and every other sin which people blame the Church and the Latin Rite specifically for are universal in both religious and secular institutions. My perception was tainted by Church Militant primarily, where my every protestant suspicion was fed so completely. Stopping watching the Vortex helped me re-enter myself on doctrine, rather than scandal. I've started watching it again, but I feel more mature, not as easily scared away from our Mother. 


Now, these are my major issues with the Church and how I've approached them. Beyond this, everything else is my own fault for being stubborn. 


**Issues with Me**


The Filioque is hard to accept unless you accept Papal authority. It just is. However, something which helped me is explanations of the trinity and the filioque by Scott Hahn, Pints with Aquinas, and Robert Barron in his Rosary explanations. That the Father gives everything to the son, and if the Father spirates the Spirit, that same spiration is given to the Son. The love between both forms the person of Spirit, hence another way of thinking of the same spiration giving form to the third person. We as catholics need to defend the Filioque and its licitness. We can't just crumble else we are undermining the authority of the Church.


The Papacy is an emotional issue. So it's only by God's grace that I changed. I now feel OK being his direct spiritual son on a fundamental level and don't feel like running away to the east.


A final problem was resolved through Scott Hahn's reflection when seeing Eastern Catholicism. He was very attracted, but his heritage was the West. It's a vestage of Protestant thinking to find some bastion of Grace and window shop certain traditions with what agrees with you. This acceptance of my heritage was helped by praying the rosary. Doing something so distinctively Latin helped cemente that its okay to embrace it despite what I grew up with, and oc the grace of Our Lady.

Why did Jesus initially refuse to aid the Canaanite woman in Matthew 16?,jackjyoung,1625170826,"I'm fairly new to my own investigation of the Bible and I've been putting a lot of time into the Gospels to start, as most people probably do. One thing that I don't entirely understand, though I thought I understood before but I clearly do not, is this section in Matthew 16:21-28. 

I understand that the Jews are God's chosen people, or at least were at this time, but it's also true that Jesus' mission on this earth was to preach the Good News to everyone, and this was not exclusive to the chosen people. There's no question there. 

And since Jesus was so quick to help the Centurion, why was He slow to help this woman? The only thing I can imagine is that it was purely a test of faith, and that He never intended to ignore her, but was merely seeing how she would respond, perhaps. 

The line about children and dogs, also confuses me, but not for the expected reason. Again, I understand the important difference between gentiles and Jews at the time, but would helping this woman be equivalent to taking away food (grace) from the children, being the Jews?

"Please help, I feel like this is all such a mess",Estella149,1625168312,"I was baptized Catholic. During my Confirmation courses in 7th or 8th grade, a Catholic church in a poorer area of our city was closing down. My parish was remodeling and it was a beautiful, but expensive remodel.
When I questioned why we weren’t diverting funds to help the struggling church stay open, our priest said it wasn’t for little girls like me to worry about. 
I was really upset and quit CCD and starting going to a non denominational Bible church with my friends.
I met my husband in 2007 and we attended various Bible and Baptist churches but never really found a church home.
During the pandemic, I started going back to the Catholic Church. I missed the tradition and my childhood memories there. My grandmother’s health was also deteriorating and it made me feel closer to her. My husband and kids liked how short it was and how engaging the priest was. I decided to make my Confirmation and was Confirmed in the fall of 2020.
They didn’t say anything about our marriage, but everything was rushed and hectic with Covid. Reading more now, I think my marriage may be invalid? I spoke with a canon lawyer who said if I made my confirmation then I am validly married. But did they miss it in the disarray of covid?
I’ve been trying to convince my husband to do a convalidation, but he is estranged from his family and unable to get his baptism records. The Baptist church he was baptized in closed down, and he is too hurt to contact family for pictures and more info. Some really really hurtful things happened and even talking about contacting them to get documents is hurtful.
The diocese asked for a letter about his baptism. It took me several weeks and a lot of fighting for him to finally write it and now our church is asking for more info in the letter. We abstained from relations from April until today waiting for convalidation but it’s destroying our marriage and making him extremely resentful of me and the church. Even if we submitted everything today, it would be another 4-6 weeks and they still want us to meet with the priest and are missing his baptismal records. Who knows how long it could be…

I want to do the right thing, but I feel like this is really hurting my marriage and my family. And all of these hoops are making him so resentful I don’t know if he will ever choose to become Catholic now and it’s breaking my heart.

The problem affecting annulments,SanantonioRose2,1625166025,"I posted a month ago about the problems I'm having with being Catholic, stemming largely from my involvement in the annulment mechanism of the local diocese.

I received a lot of responses, the vast majority polite and helpful. Many thanks. I received one, however, which I kept and re-read and I want to present here, but I'll leave it to the author to identify him or herself if they want. I present it here because it really, really sums up well what I'm so distraught over.

The author marks three ways of approaching marriage. 1.Allow divorce and remarriage freely, 2.Grant zero annulments or, 3: Presume failed marriages to be null.

 

&gt;But I don’t think it’s necessarily bad to have the order be: first concluding the putative marriage wasn’t real by the very fact of its true dissolution, and *then* investigating the cause at the root (so as to make sure it’s not repeated).  
&gt;  
&gt;Abuse would then be annulling marriages that truly could still be reconciled, or rushing the investigation into the cause in such a way that the same mistakes might simply be made again.  
&gt;  
&gt;After all, when a coroner is investigating a death, they don’t say “I’m assuming this guy is alive until I can identify a cause.” They say “this guy is clearly dead so there must be a cause, now we must find it.”

&amp;#x200B;

The above paragraph is a really well written summation of what *every single judge I know and have spoken to thinks.* And, it's entirely wrong. So, this author has very, very well summed up *the problem.*

The above opinion presumes that what is ""valid"" or ""invalid"" is *the continuing committment,* what one of the judges here called ""The spirit-enlivened relationship."" 

No.

The ONLY thing which is valid or invalid is the reception of the sacrament by both parties. This happens in a moment, when consent is publicly given. If consent is validly given by both parties 

(if you don't understand all that this implies, please go look up actual Catholic theology of marriage, and the pre-requisites a person must have to validly enter into a marriage - it's actually pretty complicated when all of the possibilities for dispensations are taken into account)  

...then the sacramental marriage exists and no subsequent actions or changes of opinion can alter this.

It is this eternal fact which the annulment tribunal exists to investigate and rule on. Was a valid marriage contracted by these two parties on their wedding day?

I thank the author if the above response for summing up why I am so scandalized by this. The priest-judges here, and after much research I'm confident to say ""everywhere"", hold a fundamental misunderstanding of what marriage is, what an annulment is, and what is possible.

That's why things are so screwed up. And that's why I'm so scandalized.",Catholicism
Praying for a friend living in total sin,Dependent-Summer2043,1625166014,"My friend of 10 years has been acting completely out of character, and I'm so worried about her.

Question about Act of Contrition,Apprehensive_Tie_805,1625161898,"I'm not a baptized Catholic (although I have enrolled in RCIA) and thus don't have the access to the sacrament of confession, and in the cases where I have stumbled into mortal sin, I've been making my best effort to make a perfect act of contrition out of sorrow for offending God and say to myself that I have a reasonable hope that God has pardoned my sins outside of the sacrament of confession, and instead I've been confessing directly to Christ since I can't confess to a priest.

Can someone link a good explanation of The Sermon on The Mount or explain the excerpts I have shared?,osteo5511,1625161789,"I have read this sermon several times but have always been confused by it.

I am not sure if a lot of what Jesus is saying is meant to be taken literally.

For example:

Mathew 5:22

But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment.

I understand the idea of this but, when would anger reach the point of mortal sin? I would assume most of us get angry at daily inconveniences.

Matthew 5:29

But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29

This is another one that has always confused me. Is looking at women enough to merit mortal sin? I read that it only becomes a mortal sin when you intend to commit an act of impurity. This is still somewhat confusing considering, most men probably feel attraction to the women around them daily.

My confessor told me to only refrain from receiving if I were to ever commit an act of impurity.

Matthew 5:33

33“Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.’ 34But I say to you, do not swear at all:

I don't even understand what this means because I never knew swearing to do something was a sin.

Mathew 5:39-42

But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. 40If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also. 41And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. 42Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away.

This is another one that confuses me. It seems as if the Scripture is saying to be a pacifist and not to engage in conflict.

This does not make sense to me because Catholics have not been known to be pacifists. We literally have crusader saints.

Also, would this mean we could never refuse the request of another for help or charity?

Mathew 6:7-8

7 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling(F) like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. (G) 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need(H) before you ask him.

Wouldnt this contradicts the way we pray as Catholics by using formulaic prayers that can involve a lot of repetition?

I also don't understand this passage.

Matthew 6:22

22 “The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy,\[c\] your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eyes are unhealthy,\[d\] your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!

Sorry if this is too much but, I have always had trouble understanding the sermon on the mount. I grew up nominally protestant and recently reconverted to Catholicism.

The explanation my protestant Pastors would give is that none of us can ever be as righteous as what is outlined in this sermon and to pretty much just trust in our faith to save us. I have obviously rejected that since I am now a confirmed catholic, lol.

Any guidance on this would be appreciated. Again, sorry for the length of this post but I feel like this is something I better get a good understanding of.",Catholicism

Feeling sick,GreyWolf_Monkey,1625160022,"I don't think it's being reported on the news here in the UK (though no doubt they would take a hostile attitude towards Catholicism) but saw on Twitter that there have been 6 or 7 catholic churches burned to the ground in Canada. Far from being condemned or having any sympathy, there is gleeful justification along with calls for more and for it to continue - one tweet even said ""Bxrn CAtholic Churches"". These people see nothing wrong with what they're doing in fact they feel justified and that it is the right thing to do. They have enormous popular support. So much so that any pro Catholic opinion is immediately hounded and backlashed against. 

What can we do? How do we change the narrative?  PEople want to oppose christianity, they are glad to do so. to direct hostility against christianity. They are glad to have an excuse to throw vitriol at the church. Its seeen as acceptable, even an obligatory duty to throw hatred at the church. Everyone is against us - Islamists, jihadis, secular people, the west, world leaders, the ignorant, the malicious. Indeed the most vicious criticism seems to be coming from white people of European descent who would consider themselves as on the right side of history, and without prejudice themselves. We are absolutely in the midst of persecution here in the western world and I honestly think this just the beginning, that anti-catholic pogroms will follow.

I feel so sad. Far from accepting the love and sacrifice of Jesus, people are indifferent to laughing at it while they reject it.  The entire world is against us and we are not on a fair playing field - things that we are accused of do not get thrown at other groups. Sympathy lies with other people not with us - we only receive hostility, scorn, condemnation and attacks.  

The tweet ""Bxrn Catholic churches"" would have received a backlash and an immediate block by twitter had it been directed against any group that was popularly accepted as being a victim group or that would cross the line of heresy against wokeism. But catholics are seen as the perpetual enemy of wokeism and popular contemporary opinion and enjoy no popularity at all.

A Saint for SSA/LGBT+ Catholics?,ThrowThisAway2k21,1625156657,"\*poll on this issue can be found at /r/SSACatholics\*

 Saints, people that were noted for their devotion to God in their life and the divine miracles that are ascribed to them, have interceded on behalf of their patronages since the beginning of the Church. While there is currently no patron for SSA/LGBT+ people, there are several canonized saints that have been seen as possible candidates. Oftentimes these patronages for for a specific group that were/are connected in some way to that Saint. For example, Saint Moses the Black is the patron saint of Africa, Saint Edith Stein is the patron saint of converted Jews, etc. 

That leads to the question posed in the title of this post. Should there be a saint for Catholics that experience same sex attraction or in anyway identify within the spectrum of non-heterosexuality? Personally, one thing that says there should is because SSA/LGBT+ Catholics have had their own unique experience with the Church and within the Church. Up onto today as Catholic who is gay or who has gender dysphoria is going to have a different experience than a Catholic who's straight, and often not for the better. Additionally, as a previous post of mine shows, it has become increasingly clear that there is a different approach needed, pastorally and philosophically, to cater to this group of people largely because what we have been doing, or rather what we haven't been doing, has shown itself to be ineffective at best. 

So is there currently canonized that would fit the bill? Some saints, St. John Newman, St. Aelred, Sts. Sergius and Bacchus, have been contended to be homosexual, although the evidence for this is heavily disputed. But that doesn't mean they wouldn't be a good patron. St. Newman did have a life-long celibate and passionate friendship with Ambrose St John, to the point in which he asked to be buried with him after he died. St. Aelred wrote *On Spiritual Friendship*, a treatise that offers a model of chaste compasionship that is heavily underultlized. And Sts. Sergius and Bacchus, while not representing a sexual or romantic love, do represent a strong same-sex brotherly love which again acts as a possible model. There are other saints whose patronages deal with chastity and temptation, St. Joseph and St. Mary Magdalene for example. Or would it be best to wait for a saint that is confirmed to have or perhaps even openly lived with same-sex attraction?",Catholicism

3 Day Prayer to the Holy Spirit (Has Never Failed Me!!!),holyspirit1313,1625115959,"My sisters and brothers I wanted to share this beautiful prayer to the Holy Spirit. What makes this prayer special is that it's only three days and you make no prayer requests during these three days, except for these words to the Holy Spirit. It is one of the most powerful prayers and it puts my heart back in the right area with the Holy Spirit. Countless miracles always occur for me when I pray this with all my heart genuinely. We all know God has set us free from sin, but I think what we forget a lot is that God has also freed us from shame and guilt. Living our lives ashamed robs us of our true identity and keeps us discouraged. But remember you are a child of God and have the Holy Spirit within you! Keep your head up high and I encourage you to pray this with me. God bless. 

Prayer:

Holy Spirit, You who make me see everything and showed me the way to reach my ideals. You who gave me the divine gift to forgive all the wrong that was done to me. And You who are in all instances of my life. I want to thank You for everything and confirm with you once more that I never want to be separated from You, no matter how great the material desire may be. I want to be with You and my loved ones in Your perpetual glory. Thank You for Your love for me and my loved ones.

I watched, what was a ‘PRIDE’ Mass, using pre consecrated hosts by a validly ordained Catholic priest, also given by two pastors of the Protestant faith, and a man in drag and makeup to a large crowd of possibly non-catholic and also, more than likely in a state of mortal sin. I listened as they rattled off their own version of the Beatitudes, which I will not utter here. 

I, have no ill feelings towards those who made the desecration occur, although, in my charity, I am white knuckling it. Why? What has Our Gentle God done to deserved to be crucified and torn apart, again, and again? Why are there no heroes to protect Him? Why are there no voices in the churches calling this for what it is?: The unbridled demonic mass desecration of the Altar.

I just wanted to rant, to put this out there because the justly felt indignation I feel is making me want to cry, and I have no one else to talk to.

Is This Bad?,ClassicGalactic,1625106915,"WARNING: I don't want to bum anyone out, so if you don't want to read anything sad, then you don't have to read this post.


I've read so many upsetting things on Reddit, like people hating Pro-Lifers, people still celebrating pride, people burning churches, people wanting to kill all religious people, people practicing witchcraft, and upsetting satanist art.

I've learned from looking into history how terrible humans can be, and I'm only 15, so I'm afraid that all this negativity is going to affect my mind in the future.

Politicians are a joke.

Governments are never safe from corruption.

Governments don't truly care about us. They just care about power.

That's the cold, hard truth.


I'm a high-schooler, and there were some girls in my English class who would preach Communism, and they even said that they wanted to Kill all Men.

I get why Women might hate Men in general, after the history of sexism and oppression, but why kill us Nice Dudes who aren't evil?

I've been losing my faith in humanity, like with toxic feminism, leftism, cancel culture, all the pornography on Reddit, all the Profanity, and the same stuff can be found on so many other sites.

I couldn't believe it when I heard that everyone deserved Hell for the first time, but now I understand why.

The CCP, North Korea, and all the people who are starving and are being discriminated against in our world.

Bullying, Murder, Crime, Riots, everything.

If I were God, I would have never created Humanity. I would have never dared!

I feel so bad for him, with how he has to feel everyone's pain every day, and how so many mock him, even though he died for all of us, so we could have hope and meaning in life, and eternal joyous life in Heaven.

Humans may be getting smarter when It comes to logic and science, but spiritually, many humans are becoming so blind.

I've heard about the horrors on the Dark Web, like Child P*rn, Snuff films, Gore, and Illegal Drugs and Weapons being sold.

I've been thinking about the glorification of satanism and sin, like cheating. Global Warming...

So, I'm starting to think that I should turn my back on all of Humanity.

I should reject strangers, and have absolute hatred for all of humankind. I should just try to hope that God doesn't send me to Hell, and just try to live far away from everyone. With absolute anger for the nature of not only everyone, but also myself...

I've done bad things, so in the end, it would be hypocritical to judge others for sinning, because I have sinned as well. We all have, as the bible says.

But I've seen commentary about why God is evil, and I would have to say that he is extremely harsh in my opinion. Eternal Suffering!? For just not believing!? That's Insane!!!!! How could a loving God be distant like that! Does he just want to enslave us!?

"As a former Mormon, I'm struggling.",messdnys,1625103281,"I'm a recent convert to the Church but I am struggling with some of the ""messaging"" or language used to describe God and our relationship to Him. But I first want to make it clear that I say all of this with sincere humility, seeking to understand and reform my opinion, and is not meant as an attack on the Church.

I come from the LDS church (Mormonism), which really stresses above all God's love for us. They also stress God's commandments, the seriousness of sin and our moral failings, and our complete dependence on divine help. But the starting point is always how much we matter to God and how much we are worth to Him and therefore I always obeyed God out of love for Him. It was like 1 John 4:19: ""Let us therefore love God, because God first hath loved us."" Because I knew how much God loved me, I was naturally very sad when I did sin because I knew I had hurt Him, and I always tried to be better to please Him. It might also be worth mentioning that the LDS concept of Hell as I remember it is that it's actually very difficult to get there and practically no one goes there, so I was never really afraid of Hell and that was never my motivation in being obedient.

Catholic teaching, at least how I've experienced it in RCIA, and certain things I've read like the Baltimore Catechism, Imitation of Christ, Lives of the Saints, etc. seems to just stress our sinfulness and unworthiness. It says that we don't deserve God's love. It says that we should feel very guilty for being so rebellious. It stresses Hell a lot. I'll give you an example: I was reading ""My Path to Heaven,"" which is a book that my parish uses to teach children the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius. In it, it says this: ""I think about how small and worthless I am. What am I compared with all the other people in the world? Couldn't God have easily gotten along without me? And I begin to look at my sores, which are my sins, and think about how nasty and filthy sin has made me all over."" And it then goes on to talk about how we should go to God and tell Him how sorry we are and thank Him for being so patient with us. And this is the kind of stuff that I encounter all the time. 

And I'm not saying that all of that isn't true. But I think about how I will talk to my children when they are older, and I would not tell them things like ""I love you even though you don't deserve it, and I would be perfectly fine if I'd never had you."" This kind of stuff makes me feel horrible. I know that my feelings aren't a standard for what's true or correct or where I actually stand with God, but I've noticed that as I've been becoming Catholic, I'm starting to feel so distant from God and so much hatred for myself that I don't want to pray. I don't feel motivated to do His will because no matter what I do, I feel like He just sees me as a failure. It feels like He's always angry at me. And I don't see Him as my loving Father like I used to. I feel despair.

Can anyone - especially any former Mormons - relate to this? What have you found helpful to focus on or do? Is it okay for me to just put down the stuff I am reading that makes me feel this way, or is there a problem within myself (like pride?) that I need to fix?",Catholicism

I’m being pushed from the church and it’s heartbreaking,MONSNovak,1625102078,"   Disclaimer: I know nobody will read this all and care or even agree but this is my feelings personally and I feel it needs to be said. Its truly heartbreaking the way this sub is going and how it’s so casual about hate and how they use Jesus to defend it. 
   A little bit of background; I grew up in an agnostic/Jewish household and since moving out to go to college I’ve started attending a Catholic Newman center on campus. I felt an intense pull towards Jesus since moving out and I felt called to dig deeper into it. I started attending RCIA classes and daily mass without fail. I studied at the church and did my school work with the holy family watching over me. I cooked there, prayed there, learned there and loved every second. My friends joked I’d end up becoming a saint if I kept at it. I have a rosary in my rear view window and pray it constantly. I love preaching and teaching people about Jesus and it truly makes my soul feel good to listen to gospel music and sit at church even when it’s not in service. I feel at peace and I know God is loving and I love and respect Him.
     The issue is with people on this sub who drop casual homophobia. The people who picket outside of planned parenthood and yell hate from the streets with their signs about the end. 
     I started attending and felt safe at my church, I felt loved and like I had a father for the first time in a long time. I attended so much and listened and learned because they welcomed me with open arms. They taught me an guided me and still are to this day but I feel less and less love for the church as a whole when I come on this sub.
     With pride month coming to an end this sub is filled with “causal memes” about how they’re so glad and how it’s disgusting and sinful. But aren’t we all sinners? Isn’t that the point, we’re all so messed up and sinful that Jesus is the answer, that He’s our savior and we need him? We should strive not to sin and be like Him but we’re human it’s not possible that’s the point! We’re trying our best and we need each other to do it. 
     I have never seen anyone picket or scream about any other “sins” or issues. It is direct hatred blasted at these poor people who are just lost and they use Jesus’s name to defend the attack. Why not sit and listen to them? Find out who they are as a person how you can help them how Jesus might be able to help them. Nobody will attend a church that despises them for one single aspect of their life. Nobody will feel Jesus’s love or welcoming arms if they’re being berated and attacked, they won’t want to.
     Seeing the casual posts with light hatred make me feel unwelcome in this community, in Catholicism. I am so deeply devoted I have no question in my mind that Jesus is real and our Savior, it’s not a belief I know. I just wish I was allowed to safely worship and praise him in a community who also does the same without being defined by a single aspect of my humanity.

Seeing God in a wrong way and how to see him as he wants?,BuzzCut08,1625094397,"This post might be long and I apologize. I feel like I have to explain my life in order for what I'm getting at to make sense.

For as long as I can remember I've been fearful of God. When I say fearful I mean afraid (terrified might be too strong of a word but I've had moments where I was close to feeling like that). I'm talking like looking at almost everything I do (even if it isn't a sin) as if I was being judged.

Growing up I've been baptized and had my confirmation. But there was so much I wasn't taught. Part of it was my folks weren't very religious themselves (I don't even think the practice anymore). The only time I went to church on Sunday was when I was at my grandparent's place as well as Christmas and Easter but that was it. My parents never took me to church on their own. Tried Sunday school a few times but it was around an hour's drive one way to my grandparent's place at the time. We moved further away so the visits became less frequent (which obviously meant less Sunday church). Over the course of my childhood/teenage life, I wasn't told much about our faith. Why do we say grace at dinner? Why do we go to church on Sunday? Why can't I do this or why do I have to do that? 

This of course eventually led me to a very dry spiritual life for quite a long time. This of course allowed a very nasty vice to take root. I'm talking about pornography. I was never told that I shouldn't do it because it was a sin. Rather I was told I shouldn't be doing it because I was too young to be looking at it (this started back in 1999 I think). Because of that (and being a hormonal teen), I looked at pornography every chance I had. This even led me to watch it while I was at work. What made it worse is my pornography addiction transformed from one of self-gratifying pleasure to that of anti-anxiety and anti-stress medicine. It's like Prozac/Xanax for me which is ironic because for some reason the actual medicine doesn't work for me.

I eventually went back to faith after hearing all the various ""end of the world was coming"" (I think the nail in the coffin was the one with the guy who basically went across the country preaching about the world ending and I think he did this twice before he passed away. I can't remember his name). It was a shock to me to see how much I wasn't taught by my family. And because of that, I feel like sometimes I'm under God's microscope for every single thing I do. I still have relapses trying to break my pornography addiction although I can say it's nowhere as bad as it was before especially since I'm actively trying to break it. My pastor tagged me to lead a pornography support group at my church because he believes it as well.

But what I'm getting at is I fear God and fear him in a way he doesn't want to be. Right now the phrase ""judge, jury, and executioner"" comes to mind instead of ""loving, merciful, compassionate, etc."" My pastor believes I have scrupulosity which isn't surprising since I am diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. I go to confession almost every Saturday and if I don't go (because I know I don't have anything to confess at the time) I start getting anxious like I'm forgetting something.

I told my pastor that, in a way, I felt like I was addicted to confession. After I did my confession and my penance I was so happy. But a few days down the road and suddenly I start thinking in the back of my mind ""Have I sinned lately?"" and I think that causes me to end up having relapses because my brain doesn't stop thinking about it. And once I do have my relapse and sin then I'm completely miserable and counting down the days until Saturdays for confession or hoping that the pastor would be able to fit me into his schedule to see me.

I think my incorrect view of God is what's getting me. I didn't realize it until recently but I am blind to seeing God because I don't see him as to how he wants to be seen. How does he want to be seen and how do I start seeing him like that?",Catholicism

Question about Justification,cm_yoder,1625091590,"I am Catholic neophyte and currently reading through the Third Council of Baltimore's Catechism.

I also know--or at least I think I do--that faith and sacraments can and do bestow justification upon us. However, virtue and vice imply choices that are made after the fall. Thus, is it fair to say that justification by faith alone is faulty because it does not consider that our justification is strengthened by our virtuous deeds and weakened by our viceful deeds?

This is the 21st century, and its scientifically known, that ""possessions"" are usually scizophrenia or some sort of mental illness that can be treated by a psychiatrist. I went to a catholic school and back when I started watching horror movies like the exorcist or the conjuring yada yada, I asked the priest what he thinks on all of this possession and exorcist stuff. He said that there havent been cases for centuries now, because these things are mental problems. So Im not trying to mock anyone here, I just saw the polish/ukrainian dudes post about his girlfriend who ""wakes up after a sleep paralysis with bruises on her neck"" etc. The post is either made up, or she does those bruises to herself either during in her sleep, or when she is awake (which is worse, but in either case, she has to get a psychiatrists help), or she is cheating on pure dude (im pretty sure about this) and other dudes leave those bruises on her.

While initially, her and I thought that her experiences are purely psychological, I’ve started to believe that it might be diabolical. She told me that she sees around 8-12 demons during the experiences, usually on Tuesdays and Thursdays. They talk to one another with high-pitched voices, and thus she knows their names. Two of them are little kids (she says their names are Bartholomew and Anne) who run around her room and play with her stuff. They also sing and dance, and don’t really harm her. However, the others are worse. She told me about one who is Half-deer, half-human, another is called Lucifer, another Jace. Another is called Irna. Most of these usually touch her and choke her, and Jace does sexual things to her (leading us to believe he could be an incubus). Another mocks her and makes fun of her. She likewise sees a demon who claims to be her late friend (who committed suicide, and that was involved in the occult and witchcraft during her life). We think these aren’t hallucinations, because my girlfriend has woken up with actual bruises and cuts on her neck after the demons interacted with her, as well as a bloody nose and ripped clothes.

Reality just kind of hit me with the new euthanasia laws in Canada,enitsujxo,1625074026,"A new bill passed in Canada in March of this year to relax current euthanasia laws in Canada :(




I was outraged by the new law but kind of forgot about it until now. Today the facility I work for sent out an email outlining the changes in the euthanasia law.




The changes include eliminating the 10 day waiting period for persons whose death is foreseeable (so basically you can request euthanasia and have it that day or the next day.




Another change is that the person requesting euthanasia no longer requires their natural death to be forseeable in order to qualify for it (butbthere is a waiting period).




This makes me sad. There is no respect for life in Canada. We are not God and we have no right to decide when to end someone's life. 




I'm also kind of scared.





One reason is that I'm an LPN working in a hospital, and I'm probably gonna see more patients on my unit that want this. 





For now, nurses are very minimally involved with euthanazing patients (they may choose to be in the room to provide emotional support for the family/patient or pass supplies to the doctor doing the procedure). But what if the laws eventually become so lax that nurses will be required to do it? If it leads to that I will absolutely refuse to have anything to do with it, they can suspend me if they want but I'm not purposefully killing a human being.


The other reason I'm scared is that euthanasia laws are only going to get more lax. I knew this when the law was first passed in 2017. And here we are  :(  I dread what could potentially be next",Catholicism

My first date with a „radical feminist“ that I met at mass: An experience that shook me,throwingaway_1992,1625055448,"Dating as a catholic isnt easy as a young (25) man in the boonies. I was very happily surprised to see a young woman I had never seen before at church. After service I approached her and we had some really good smalltalk. The week after that we chatted once again and it went great! Then in the next week again I asked to get some coffee together and I was over the moon! Finally a date and finally a woman who seems like a fellow catholic. We scheduled to grab some coffee at tuesday.

So I had some time and I did some digging about this woman on twitter and it was…weird… Her profile instantly read „Radical feminist, Pro-choice catholic, #MeToo“. I cringed but dug a little deeper and saw that she followed many radical left pundits and stuff which made me uncomfortable. Accounts that claimed all men are rapists, nonsense about white privilege, soft-porn (""LadyBoners"")... Still I thought... Well she herself didnt write anything misandrist so lets give her a chance... Oh boy.

So now at tuesday the date begins, and its off to a decent start. But then the topics begin to shift. First she really talked very long about how western men have historically oppressed women, and how nowadays this discrimination is still taking place. She said that by just being a man I was already part of the problem, and how I had to prove her that I was not a rapist ""like all western men"". She added that being a white man was a double crime, as I belonged to the two groups that perpetrated and perpetuated discrimination in all societies. She also mentioned that a lot of men were judgmental of her past, because she used to be a sex worker and had both boyfriends and girlfriends. ""Since Jesus preached forgiveness, you should accept everything about me"".

Later it shifted to politics unfortunately and it went from bad to worse. She began to rant about basically anyone who wasn't an avid pro-feminist activist. According to her, disagreeing on her views about feminism was ""gender violence"" and ""against catholic beliefs"". She claimed that actual catholics are pro-choice, and cited Thomas Aquinas as a source that justified abortion.

Then came what really made me upset. Since its pride month I mentioned that I didn't support hormone treatment for underage kids, and that parents should be allowed to stop their kids pursuing such irreversible treatments. She got visibly angry and called me a nazi. According to her, by rejecting these children their identity, I was ""condemning them to a life of suffering"" and that ""I could not be a christian if I held such hateful, misogynistic views"".

"Agnostic Atheist ""seeker"" with questions about efficacy of his Prayers",TheSanguineLord,1625052106,"I feel as though I should provide at least some context to the question, but don't want to overburden the post with a wall of text. Below is as condensed a story as I can give, but feel free to skip to the questions in the next section:

	• To my shame, I used to take Dawkins seriously on Religion and had a warped perspective about Christianity from exposure to Ken Ham, Kent Hovind and other such 'preachers'.

	• My long-term girlfriend, who had been baptised Catholic but wasn't practicing when we started dating, became more serious and involved in her faith, resulting in her Confirmation about a few years ago.

	• Of course, I wanted to support her as much as I could, so I would attend Mass with her, practice hymns with her (she joined the choir), and once COVID re

	• As part of this, I wanted to learn more about the Catholic faith so I started looking around on Youtube and starting watching Bishop Barron, Council of Trent, Ascension Presents, Pints with Aquinas and read Feser's ""5 proofs"" and Kreeft's ""Practical Theology"". 

	• Having been unconvinced by philosophy\*\* alone, got the idea to try a prayer for God to show Himself to me.

\----

So, I've been giving prayer a go for about a week and (truth be told) feeling like a bit of a prat, and some thoughts have occurred to me:

1) Does prayer **require** faith in order to function? If so, I'm in a bit of a catch-22 in terms of praying for something that might 'bootstrap' faith.

2) If prayers of a non-believer can work, what (in people's opinion) is the best methodology to go about such prayers? Currently, I'm attempting akin to meditation + enunciating the prayer in my mind.

2) I've tried to phrase the prayer in such a way as to ask, respectfully, that God reveal himself in some way that I'll understand. I'm not expecting a pillar of fire or a burning bush, but now I'm concerned that maybe I might miss the sign….or might have missed it already. Is this a reasonable concern? Does anyone have suggestions as to what things I might be particularly vigilant for?

I'm open to all other comments, suggestions and questions. I know that on the internet talk is cheap, but I really am trying to understand more.

"Lamentations, Baruch, and a mess of Ezras",coinageFission,1625047215,"So we all know the canon list universally agreed on by the Roman Church: the Damasine List, dating from the Council of Rome (382) and given in the Decree of Gelasius (492-496), reconfirmed by the Councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage (397), by Innocent I's letter to Exuperius (405), and *twice* given the solemn force of an Ecumenical Council -- at Florence (*Cantate Domino*, 1442) and at Trent (*De Canonicis Scripturis*, 1546).

\[REMINDER: Eastern Churches, both in communion with Rome and not, use a bigger biblical canon than we Latins do, but include all the same books we already have.\]

A surprising thing to note about these canon lists is that at first glance they don't appear to agree with each other, though in truth this is due to various differences in the way the books are actually divided up. The most notable case is when canon lists omit Baruch (Damasus), Lamentations (Florence, Trent), or both (Hippo, Carthage, Innocent), an apparent discrepancy easily resolved by remembering that in times past, those two tended to be treated as extensions of Jeremiah. Some canon lists, that differ from the Damasine List in other places, explicitly mention all three and include the Letter against idolatry -- ""Jeremiah, with Baruch, Lamentation, and the Epistle"", a formula found in the canon lists of St Cyril of Jerusalem (348/350), the Council of Laodicea (363-364), St Athanasius (367), and St Epiphanius of Salamis (374-378).

On the other hand, it is constantly witnessed that all the early canon lists mention two books of Ezra, with Florence and Trent specifying the first as Ezra and the second as Nehemiah. But curiously (and differently), the Septuagint with which the early Christians would have been very familiar with has two books of Ezra (Esdras A and B) -- and *both* are two different translations from the Hebrew original of Ezra-Nehemiah. The Greek retained them as such, the Vetus Latina also kept them, but Jerome removed the redundancy by translating directly from the Hebrew, and later copyists split his work into the two books we have today. They correspond well to the Septuagint’s Esdras B. And Esdras A? Its Latin translation is the apocryphal 3 Esdras, placed in an appendix to the Old Testament along with 4 Esdras and the Oratio Manassae by Clement VIII.",Catholicism

Question about Mary and Evolution,ReflectionOk1747,1625041076,"I watched Fr. Chad Ripperger’s video on evolution and the culture of death. He said four things that struck me.

One: The Marian dogma of her immaculate conception suggests that she is THE immaculate conception, thus to believe we revolved from apes and Adam and Eve were conceived before they committed original sin goes shading this.

Two: Evolution suggests nature moves from a lower state to a higher state which contradicts most of what we know.

Three: the idea of theistic evolution where God at each steps alters the course of evolution violates the principle of economy, where it is much simpler for God create everything in one motion than to constantly cause miraculous events in every living thing.

Four: something about how each creature has an intrinsic nature or that evolution from one species to an entirely new species goes against God’s. That it violates the procope of integral good in which all that is good has God as its source, and thus all life must have God as its direct, not indirect, creator. Like how Thomas Merton said even daisies are like saints in so such mush as they do exactly what God designed them for, being daisies, and thus are good and pleasing to God and in this way give Him praise.

What do these mean for Genesis and literal vs metaphorical interpretations? I’m sure people will disagree on these four points, but in regard to assuming they either are or are not correct, how greatly would this alter our interpretation of Genesis?

P.S. - I myself am perfectly open to the idea of a literal interpretation, or at least literal in terms of the creation of life, as to suggest it impossible would be to place finite limits on an infinite God as far as I can see.",Catholicism

I've read that the Catholic Church condemns artificial insemination and IVF, even if it's the husband's sperm, but I can't wrap my head around why that's the case. Sure, one might see children as gifts from god and as gifts, one can't force the giver's hand to make this gift.

"Considering converting to Catholicism but I work on Sundays, will that be an issue?",blayne288,1625036036,"Hello, I've been a southern Baptist my whole life and have recently been taking theology very seriously. In the process of taking theolgy very seriously, I've come to realize something just doesn't sit right with me in the evangelical answers. They're logically satisfying, but there are always 10 answers for the same question. I feel that God put it on my heart to realize that there can only be but one interposition of His will and His word, not dozens. This then led me to do some research into Catholicism. 

I came from a super anti-catholic household, and my mother having previously being born and raised a Catholic, I simply took her word for fact and never questioned it. That is, until now. I feel like I've had an absolute paradigm shift, and my views on Christianity, and what Christianity might mean to me, has been completely flipped upside down on it's head. I feel like so much of what I've been raised into is interpreting what the Bible says, instead of actually living and actually acting as the Bible calls us to do. Why waste time interpretating, when the one, original church, founded by Christ himself, already has the answer? Why not otherwise spend that time acting as Christ calls us to, and understanding the Bible as the original church, founded by Christ, intended us to?

Regardless, sorry for my rant, I'm just very excited because this whole theology is completely different from what I've been used too. On to my original purpose for this post I suppose. I understand Catholic Christians take their church attendance much more seriously than other denominations. Currently I work a weekend shift. I work 12's on the weekends and I also work 8's on Thursday Friday. It isn't out of necessity per se, but, I do prefer it because it comes with quite a pay bump. I've also since been elected the union representative for my shift, and enjoy the freedoms it gives me(I have 3 day weekends, and occasionally 5 if I so choose not to work Thursday and Friday.) 

My question is, is it mandatory for me to attend Sunday Mass? Currently I attend a weekly Bible study at my church instead of the Sunday service. It is to my understanding, there is Mass on other days than Sunday, but from what I've read, Sunday Mass should only be missed out of absolute necessity. If this is in fact the case, do Catholic church's often have multiple services? Waking up earlier than usual to actually attend wouldn't be much of an issue. 

My other question regarding this, is, would I be sinning for even working Sundays in the first place? I know the Bible calls us to rest on the Sabbath, but from what I'm raised in, the Sabbath doesn't necessarily mean Sunday. As long as you take one day out of the week to rest and glorify God, it didn't matter which day. For me now, that's Wednesday. 

Any responses would be great, I would love the help. Perhaps soon I should get in contact with a local church and sit down with someone to ask these questions. Thanks guys, and glory be to God!

Question about conscience,IratePixel,1625029753,"Hello everyone!

I know someone who believes it is sinful to play any type of game which has anything in it that would be sinful to do in real life. The same would apply to movies and such I assume. I tend to be of the mind that since videogames and movies are not real, it is not inherently sinful to enjoy these avenues of entertainment as long as you're not being led into temptation or sin and it is not hurting your spiritual life nor keeping you from performing your duties in life.

So here's the question: is it a sin on my part if I recommend him a game and encourage him to play it? Or a movie, or whatever else. The reason I ask is he would technically be violating his conscience. I have told him what I think about these forms of entertainment but that if he truly does believe that they're sinful, he should not play them as to not violate his conscience. It's worth noting that he already does play games, watch movies and listens to music with potentially sinful themes such as violence or worshipping other gods (obviously in a fictional universe and neither him nor I are tempted to actually go out and worship pagan gods as far as I'm aware).

A faith we can decide for ourselves is no faith at all. And no minority has any reason to allow a majority to prescribe what it should believe. Either the faith and its practice come to us from the Lord by way of the Church and her sacramental services, or there is no such thing. The reason many people are abandoning the faith is that it seems to them that the faith can be decided by some officials or institutions, that it is a kind of party program; whoever has the power is able to decide what should be believed, and so it is a matter of getting hold of power oneself within the Church or, on the other hand - more obviously and logically - just not believing.

My boyfriend and I are talking about matrimony and I’ve been reading extensively on Catholic traditions. I could have sworn that it was customary for the bride and groom to walk in together but each TradCat ceremony I’ve seen has had the father walk the bride down the aisle.

After doing some research I found out that the ancient and traditional Catholic tradition is to have the bride and groom walk in together. The Catholic church recommends this because it symbolizes their consent. This is also why Catholic weddings never include the question, ""who gives this woman?"" since it could end up as cause for annulment.

This tradition also seems so romantic to me. For your first time seeing each other to be when y’all are about to walk down the aisle and enter into holy matrimony as one. 

Has anyone else done this? Was your family offended? Is the “dad walking down the aisle” thing a Protestant thing that just became the norm after V2?

I am disgruntled with general Christianity in today's American society. Frustrated with pop concert churches and non biblical liberal Christianity. So while I'm proud to be a simple follower of Jesus and the Bible, only practicing what it says and not adding anything more, I have some questions about the Catholic faith. I admit also that I'm debating a tad bit on whether to accept catholicism. 


1) Am I wrong in assuming it's ok for high priests and/or the pope to interpret and add onto the bible/faith/practices? I've heard some catholic priests say it's ok. However Revelations 22:18-19 say otherwise:                 ""I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book."" As well as multiple other passages. 


2) Humans are so easily corruptible. I dont need to mention that typical anti-catholic talking points about priests grosly abusing power and have a history of the official church offering cheats into heaven (buy a ticket, go crusade, etc.) How can such a organization who's given so much power in the denomination be trusted? 


3) I can't get over praying to the saints thing. I understand that you all don't worship them like Jesus, but it feels like idols of other spiritual beings to me. Is there a way someone can put the revering of saints that doesn't sound like heresy?

And what's the national color of the Netherlands? (After all, St. Therese doesn't always answer our prayers, when she does, with a literal flower)   


That's an easy reply, right? I've found my future lifelong partner, and we've lived happily ever after. Only thing is, none of that happened. There'd be at least a 2 week delay between our messages because she wasn't a premium member, and because I ran low on money, I couldn't renew my membership, which means we haven't talked since then. Naturally, that whole situation caused me to simply brush off everything that happened thus far, and to think as of what happened as either wishful thinking on my part, or as a devil-ish deceit, since it was a sign that wasn't confirmed down the road. Or so I thought. In the days and weeks following that up to today, I've witnessed things which I'm not sure can be considered signs or not, such as:  


\- A lot of things I've read, from Quora to books to articles, on the widest variety of subjects mention the Netherlands to some extent;  
\- When I picked up a mate of mine to hang out one time, he started a conversation about the Netherlands and Dutch architecture as soon as he got in my car, completely out of the blue;  
\- When I'm driving home from a test, I'm waiting for the light to go green, when I casually spot two flags hanging from a window, one of my country (Brazil), and another from the Netherlands.  


As much as I'm trying to shake all of that off, my mind keeps drifting back to it. I asked a friend who's on the verge of entering seminary about this whole situation, and he said: ""You see, you know this (sign) is of God because it is very specific: Not only was orange for a country you've never been to, but its also the national color! And God always goes above and beyond our expectations to make sure it's very certain. And you know this isn't ambiguous because it was beyond what you expected."".  


With all of that being said, I'd really like to hear your opinions about this situation. Please comment if there's any part of the story you'd like clarification on. Thank you in advance to everyone! Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum!",Catholicism

Is this anger sinful?,Mental-Pineapple-504,1625009070,"So my mom has been having issues with the neighbors. They built a fence 6 feet into her land without any permission (the ordinance says anything close to 4 inches and you need written approval from the neighbor... They never asked anything). My mom's been talking with a lawyer, and they sent a letter to them, which has resulted in him and his wife playing ""good cop, bad cop"" with her.

The wife approached her and tried to flip it on her saying how upset she was that she felt the need to hire a lawyer, that they were going to help her mow the grass, and that its just so much property for her to take care of. The guy calls the lawyer 5 times trying to claim adverse possession and now wants to buy the land because he hasnt lived there long enough for that and that was a blatant lie.

Its expensive, and my mom is thinking about selling them the property because of the cost and hassle of a lawsuit. I told her id work to help pay for the fees because its the principle of it all, trying to pull a fast one and even after, refusing to hold themselves accountable. Had they would have asked to buy prior or even after accepted responsibility and tried to resolve it without trying to make themselves seem blameless, I'd feel differently. But, i am furious because they are probably going to get away with it (theyve made a habit of trying stuff like this with other neighbors in the past). I want them to learn a lesson that they need to treat their neighbors with respect and they cant walk all over a 72 year old lady because it was convienient for them.

This is where it gets sinful... I noticed them outside, and seeing them made my blood boil (this meeting about this happened a few hours ago, so its still fresh). I cursed without thinking, then told myself right after that I shouldn't be that way. I know this part i really need to work on...i know i screwed up right after i did it with that part, but am I justified for being angry right now about this or is the whole thing sinful? Im concerned about mortal sin because i know that part was at least venially sinful. And any tips on how to keep this anger in check so it doesn't fester and turn into more serious feelings?

Im trying really hard to evaluate my actions better. Thinking about confession this week, but its after mass so I'm not sure about communion. Im also having a hard time finding the line between justified anger and when it becomes a sin...i dont really want them to suffer, i just want them to stop trying to take advantage of her and learn they cant just do whatever they want and constantly get away with it and take from others for their own gain.

I read somewhere that the novena prayer should be prayed at the same time everyday for the prayer to be most effective.

But in the Blessed Sacrament He is completely vulnerable. Even though He knew how ungrateful and cold we'd be (so many abuses and sacrileges).  
If He who is God abandoned Himself to the hands of sinful men, why is that I wouldn't abandon myself in His loving in caring hands? He knows what I need and what's truly good for me, but I still struggle to trust Him. I know all things work for the salvation of our souls and we need bitter remedies to heal the wounds of our sins.

Catholicism and Modernity,MorelsandRamps,1624998005,"Hi friends, this subject in many ways has been weighing heavily on my heart in recent weeks, but is especially on my mind today. Today there was an interesting thread on Catholicism’s relationship with fascism. It started off as an interesting conversation, but eventually devolved as many commentators used it as an excuse to defend historic fascist regimes as compatible with Catholicism. The thread was eventually locked by the mods. I’m not looking to revisit this topic, but such an intense discussion reminded me of a seriously problematic attitude I see among many American Catholics that I feel we should address. It involves how many of us see our relationship with the modern world.

Possibly the most important question on the minds of modern Catholics is how we should interact with the modern world. It was, in fact, the great question of Vatican II and why the council was called at all. It’s a question that’s asked of every Christian in every generation, but in our modern society, the question seems to have much more urgency. Other generations took for granted how thoroughly religious society was. We are not so lucky. We therefore have a much more difficult existence in these times. In a time where the majority of people are either hostile or indifferent to religion, we practicing Catholics can feel like aliens in our own societies. 

A natural impulse to these conditions is react negatively. Those who do seem to either want to retreat into the safety of our traditions or condemn the outside society wholesale. In this view, society is completely fallen beyond repair. It is a hellhole of moral relativism and “degenerate” behavior. Attempts at reaching modern, non-Catholic people are hopeless, as it would necessitate the watering down of our beliefs and compromising the truth of Christianity. In these circumstances, it is best to see the Catholic Church as a bulwark against these forces, who must be resisted by any means necessary. In relation to the former thread regarding Catholicism and fascism, it means that any forces outside the Church that will help shield us from this completely fallen society are to be considered allies, no matter how morally dubious. 

I think this worldview is the absolute wrong way to approach the problem of modern society. In fact, I think if we double down on this thinking, we will continue to hemorrhage members and will be unable to complete the Church’s evangelical mission. We will doom ourselves. 

The Catholic Church is not primarily an institution dedicated to defending upright moral values. We are not the Jesus Christ Society for the Promotion of Moral Excellence. We cannot take an antagonistic stance towards modern society on simply moral or ethical matters, even though they may be seemingly grievous matters. Yes, ethical living is an important part of living a Christian life. In fact, I believe our moral teachings are some of the most beautiful aspects of our faith. But to a modern person who is completely divorced from any semblance of Christian spirituality, beginning any dialogue on Christianity with moral pronouncements could be completely ineffective. We will be talking over the heads of these people. Anyone who doesn’t have a concrete grounding in the spiritual life is not going to appreciate the depth of Catholic moral teaching. We, I believe, have to approach dialoguing with the modern world in a different way. At least at first. 

Which takes me to my final point. In order to successfully engage with modernity, we as Catholics need to offer modern people what they lack. Poll after poll has shown that despite practical religious indifference, modern people are still intensely interested in religion. Something like 80% of Americans pray, despite many not belonging to any church. Close to that believe in an afterlife as well. What that says to me is that modern people are still trying to access the spiritual side of their lives, but don’t think Christianity can offer them anything. Our duty as Catholics, therefore, should be to introduce them to the rich Catholic spiritual, sacramental, and theological tradition as the answer to their heart’s deepest desires. We need to show them how Catholicism can be a positive force in their lives, not a negative one. 

The first chapter of one of my favorite books, “Introduction to Christianity” by Joseph Ratzinger / Benedict XVI, is an almost 60 page essay on the first words of the Creed: “I believe.” Before exploring the central claims of Christianity, Ratzinger starts with why modern people should believe in anything at all. Taking our lead from Ratzinger, I think we must begin here as well. The answer to the question of why we believe cannot be because our faith offers a “less degenerate” social and political system. Nor can it be because it will make us morally upright people as opposed to the “godless barbarians” our society is full of. The answer can only be that we believe because through an authentic encounter with Jesus Christ, we fulfill the deepest desires of our hearts, which is ultimately union with God. If we evangelize with anything else it mind, it will all come to nothing.",Catholicism

Adam and Eve Revisited,TheNicholsonBlade,1624996574,"The Adam and Eve Story Revisited

My take on this situation is not a literal one. My research shows that it’s probable that the Adam and Eve story is a allegory. For what you might ask? Well for selfishness of course. The ability to want for ones self without regard for the other. This has always cause the fall of societies so we are given this lesson first and foremost in our Holy Book.

This is a fall from unity conscience of humanity and the disease of selfishness that is ever present until it is completely rejected when all humans once again desire unity with each other.  A One World Philosophy so to speak that doesn’t have to be spoken anymore because the lesson has been learned.

Eve was tempted into desiring the apple. Desiring without the conscience thought of repercussions for her other half’s self or how it would affect her unity with Adam and God. She bit the Apple of self and fell away from Unity. The snake lied yes but she knew full and damn well what was said she just didn’t understand why until after the ACT! The act is the most important part because that is the manifestation of the emotional desire. OKAY so I’m Eve and I just made a boo boo.  Now I feel like I just had half of me torn out of me because I was once whole and now I have been torn into two because I was selfish. Meaning I no longer have regard for others and this corrupted my thinking. Now It doesn’t say what the dialog between Eve and Adam was but I’m assuming it went something like this.......

Eve: Hey honey how’s it going?

Adam: Great I was just picking some apples and naming some animals. Isn’t it great that we live together and don’t have to worry about anything because we all have the same common interest of love and unity together?

Eve: YEA yea that’s great and all... you remember how I said I went for a walk earlier and I saw that tree that God said not to eat from? 

Adam: Yea what a bout it? Honesty it kind of gives me the creeps. It kind of looks unnatural to me. The fruit just looks kind of strange like it’s rotten on the inside. 

Eve: Okay don’t be Mad but......

Adam: ???? What is Mad....?

Eve: Don’t mind that...Well I kind of took to a bite of that apple and guess what.....

Adam: ?????

Eve: Nothing happened. Isn’t that great!?

Adam: But GOD said not to eat it! He wants the best for us obviously so why would you even think about that? 

Eve: Well there was a snake and he said I would be even more like God!

Adam: Wait a Snake told you would be like God? That’s silly because I can’t create all this stuff like him...I can only make what he made more beautiful....

Eve: Honestly I feel great and I think you should try it too. Remember he said we would die? Well guess what....I’m still standing... don’t we do everything together?

Adam: Well you are right....You are still a alive and you don’t look bad. In fact you look great still.

Eve: I know right???? 

Adam: Why would God lie about that? There must be some mistake....

Eve: No mistake. Heres a fruit from the tree. Have a bite and you will see...

*Adam takes a bite*

Adam: What just happened? I have a weird feeling like I’ve done something against myself? Why do I care less about God and more for myself? What have you done to me?

*Eve starts crying*

Eve: I know!! I needed you to help me with this feeling. I don’t know what it is but it’s like you were part of me and now you are not and I didn’t want to be with this feeling alone! I needed you to understand it so you could help me!!!

Adam: Wretched woman what have you done!!!! I am ashamed of you and of myself... I’m going to go put a fig leave on my sensitive parts because how could I show you my vulnerability like that again when you had no regard for it and threw away my trust!!!

*God walks in*

God: Adam my son...why are you wearing Fig leaves? I sense your shame. You ate from that Tree of Selfishness didn’t you?.....”

Adam: Tree of Selfishness? I thought it was the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil?

God: What’s the point if I give you all the answers? There is no point to that. You can only know evil if you only think of yourself and no one else. Otherwise you can only think for the good of all. This the real name of the tree. If I said Tree of Selfishness you wouldn’t understand because you wouldn’t comprehend what selfishness was. Now that you ate, so the true name is revealed and you punishment of returning to unity begins. Get out of my house. 

Adam: BUT BUT BUT the woman you gave me tricked me!!!!

God: Oh so you enjoyed her one moment and thanked me and now you spit in my face? Get out of here you ungrateful wretch. Lies beget lies and your ungratefulness will always breed evil in your heart.

Adam: BUT BUT when can I come back??

God: When you learn to extinguish selfishness with Love Gratefully. 

Thus humanity is always kicked out of the Garden of Eden when it’s mentality is filled with selfishness.

How can you know for sure truths about angels and demons when you can't see them yourself?,Silent-Guitar4526,1624992103,"This question was posed to me as I was trying to convert someone in my family.

The person believes in God (and even Christ but in an highly unorthodox view) but doesn't believe one can prove His existence, following similar reasoning.

My Return to Catholicism,acolevfx,1624981403,"I was touched by the conversion post yesterday and thought I would share my experience in light of it.  

I was raised in the Catholic Church and that was really all I knew.   Family, friends, schools, and community were all within this environment and I knew nothing different.  My parents were adament on keeping me away from outside influences so I wouldn't become corrupted.  I had heard of other belief systems, but assumed them to be a very small percentage of people since I knew nobody like that. 

I have always been very inquisitive and I love learning new things.   So inevitably there were things that leaked into my experience that my parents didn't approve of.  My father in particular has much skepticism about the modern scientific worldview and so things like evolution, homosexuality, and even astrophysics would prompt stricter limitations on my exploration.  Nevertheless, I would soak in everything I could get my hands on.

I never really had many issues with the Catholic view until high school.   That's where I was surrounded by people who didn't share my worldview at all.  I met and befriended people that were adament about disagreement with the Church and organized religion in general.   I even had teachers that challenged my views.  

Bit by bit, my faith was chipped away by my peers, my teachers, and my scientific endeavors that seemed to contradict everything I had grown up with.   I started exploring mild substances like alcohol and marijuana which added to my questions.  I then began to regard my parents and former companions as well meaning, but naive in their beliefs.   

I remember one video in particular really kickstarted my move toward atheism.  It was a video called ""Zeitgeist"" that made a strong case that all religion was basically a modified form of sun worship.   I had no defense for this argument and it shook my relationship with God.  Now when I prayed, I started to feel like I was talking to the sun.   

I began to look into everything I had been sheltered from and regarded this as an awakening to the truth that had been kept from me.  I was particularly entranced with debates from Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, and Matt Dillahunty.  They were excellent thinkers and mopped the floor with their Christian counterparts to be honest. 

From there I stopped going to church.  I only went on occasion when my parents insisted.   I was confident in my newfound atheism and even felt some superiority due to my scientific and philosophical knowledge.   I would challenge other Christians and try to dismantle their worldview so they could awaken to ""truth"" like I had.   I felt like I was doing them a favor.   I would even say I was a bit angry at the Church for having deceived my family and for standing in the way of progress.

After a few years, the ""atheist glow"" wore off and nihilism started to take hold.  Taking my materialist worldview to it's logical conclusion, I came to believe that I was a meaningless cluster of dust that had nothing to look forward to but death.   All my joys in life were hedonistic and fleeting.  To me, meaning was an invention and could be changed at any point in time.   

This starts to lead to depression.  I started grasping for straws.  I tried Buddhism.  I tried Pantheism.  I tried to do more meditation and to manifest meaning with with vision boards.  But deep down, I was dead inside because that's where it all ends up.  I even remember crying because ultimately I was alone with nothing permanent.  Not even my own soul. 

This is where things get interesting.  I remember reaching out in prayer saying ""If there is a God somehow, please find me.""  

One night in college, I decided to try psychedelics for fun with some friends.   I took some lsd and went on a journey.   I got separated from my friends and met up with someone who showed me an art book.   It was called ""Sacred Mirrors"" by Alex Grey.  In a nutshell, he paints the different levels of the self and you journey through layers from body to mind to spirit.  The ""mirrors"" end with God as a source of light from within.   

This all made so much sense to me and moved me in such a profound way.   I meditated on and contemplated that book for a few years.   I then decided I was no longer atheist and that I did believe in God.  

From there, it was a search for ultimate truth.  I began to build from the ground up.  I found Truth is objective and not an invention of the mind.   I discovered the soul and so much deep historical discourse that I had formerly disregarded as dark age nonsense.   

I slowly became convinced in a Western worldview, but still felt like mixing other religions in to my liking.   Then I discovered Jordan Peterson.  Something about the way he makes sense of the world ignited my passion for Christianity again.  I was able to reconcile with my Father found that he had so much knowledge I wasn't willing to listen to before. 

From Peterson I found lots of other sources.   I found Jonathan Pageau and ""the Symbolic World."" I found literature such as ""Man's Search for Meaning"" and ""Crime and Punishment.""  I found John Vervaeke's ""Awakening from the Meaning Crisis.""  I found so many other people who were asking the same questions I was and had similar journeys.   I'm so grateful for this man. 

I had a pregnant wife and some kids and as they got older, this pushed me to take my search for Truth seriously.   I want to be a good father and to give them a solid foundation for morals and reason. 

So through the experience of fatherhood I am finding the Catholic Church is the best place to find Truth.  I just brought my family into the church, got my children's First Communion and Confirmations.  I am now studying the lives of the Saints and found a very rational and smart Catholic who thinks at a high level: GK Chesterton.  

I am so happy and blessed to come back to the Church.  I find the opposite of my atheist view.  Everything is full of life and meaning and my family is happy and learning to live in harmony.   

Thanks to all of you who made it this far.   I know that was a lot of text lol",Catholicism

Recently, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/ntx3fu/help_a_protestant_understand_catholicism/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) regarding how I was raised protestant, but gained a huge interest in Catholicism after reading the bible myself for the first time. Of particular interest was Mathew 16, 17-19, where Jesus describes Peter's role, seemingly calling him the pope. 

Through the encouragement I got from you guys in my last post, I decided to visit my local church for the first time. And wouldn't you believe it, the main verse being discussed during the first mass I attend was Mathew 16, 17-19. This truly felt like a religious experience, as so many things had to line up for me. I had to start reading the bible at a certain time, notice the specific verse that sparked my interest in Catholicism, and had to attend mass just the right day to hear the priest discuss the verse.

My Fight Against Sexual Sin,GoldenAceKiller,1624975371,"I've mentioned this before, but I fell into sexual sin by accident when I was still in elementary school. It's been more than a decade. Since then, it's been a problem in my life. I didn't start actively fighting it until maybe one or two years ago. At first, it did get worse maybe because my body was just used to it at that point. However it has slowly getting better. These are the steps that I am taking.

1. Know when you need to get professional help.

2. Trust in God, receive the Sacraments often, pray often. Ask for others' support and ask for them to keep you in their prayers.

3. Keep someone in mind that you are doing this for. Could be God, your spouse, your children, your friends. Like going to war and having a photo of your family to remind you of what you're fighting for.

4. Anytime you are tempted, take a deep breath, clear your mind, maybe take a walk and distance yourself for the stimulus that is tempting you. Sometimes it helps to do something silly, like dart your eyes while humming the happy birthday song apparently.

5. Commit to it and hold yourself accountable. Have it on your mind every morning when you wake up that you are working to be chaste and striving for holiness.

6. Replace the bad habit with a better habit. Take up a new hobby.

7. Know the moments when you might be more easily tempted: tiredness, stressfulness, hungriness, et cetera. This means that it will be important to increase the probability of not sinning by taking care of our health.

8. Persevere through the withdrawal symptoms. It will hurt and feel awful.

9. Learn about the issue. Research the basic pyschology that's going on. See what others' strategies and tips are.

10. A reward and punishment system. Make it through a day, give yourself a small treat. If you don't, come up with a reason that might deter you to decrease the probability of sinning again. Maybe, no Internet time, no phone, no games, et cetera.",Catholicism

How to love/share Catholicism without coming off as arrogant/prideful?,enlightenedempanada,1624974970,"Hi everyone, I've been thinking about this issue for a while and would like to receive advice. My parents were watching an Israeli show/movie where three radical orthodox Jews hurt a Palestinian teen because they believed in their racial/religious supremacy. My dad then told me to ""be careful"", because apparently when I speak of my Catholic faith, I sound like I'm placing myself on a pedestal over everyone else and can end up with a similar idea of supremacy. I brushed it off because it was a very extreme comparison. I always speak of my faith as the fullness of truth (without speaking poorly of non-Catholics), but I think my parents are bothered at my speaking of Catholicism as the most ideal, and it's objective truth as Christ's church. They tend to excuse it by saying ""but what about \*insert Catholic here\* that was a bad Christian or did bad things? I know other people outside of the faith that were a better example"". Ultimately, I just want to know how to embrace and preach the Catholic faith as the fullness of truth without seeming arrogant, yet also without compromising with moral objectivism.

Just a few things I’d like to get off my chest,DirtyDan45,1624968205,"So my parents used to be Catholic when me and my siblings were younger but they converted to Protestantism and moved between several different evangelical churches. My brother and I are currently in the process of converting to Catholicism in our mid 20’s now and we catch shit from our parents all the time. “It’s not biblical, the Catholic Church doesn’t teach the Bible, it’s an evil organization” etc.

It’s ironic that more than anything, the reason my brother and I left Protestantism (specifically evangelism) was the dramatic nonsense we heard growing up, like how the end times were here, Obama was the antichrist, QAnon, charismatic Christianity, rapture talk, etc. the criticisms I have of evangelism are the same they have of Catholicism; their belief system isn’t biblical.

What to do with animal souls?,Kerghan1218,1624967992,"I'm at overnight emergency veterinarian.
Almost all of my patients are in a bad way, and I see more death than I care to comment on. 

Euthanasia is ubiquitous in my field, and staunchly considered part of the standard of care. Allowing an animal to undergo a natural death is basically condemned by my colleagues. I am newly returned to the faith, and up until very recently my views were lock-step with the rest. I had discussed it during my general confession, and my priest had advised me that as animal souls are not divinely inspired, their suffering does not explicitly bring them closer to Our Lord; it's not a sin like it would be if I were an MD.  So I still do it, but it's not as easy as it used to be.

The problem I'm having, though, is that I have a profound amount of empathy for them. I can't explain it to them, I can't apologize for what I know is going to happen, I can't prepare them for their journey - natural or assisted. I have an urge to want to bless them or anoint them or somehow - to paraphrase off the old Roman custom - give them a coin for their journey.

What are good arguments against Deism?,Prestigious_Set_1128,1624961300,"I think the single best argument in favor of Deism is the watchmaker analogy: Like a watchmaker, God created the universe in such a way that it can ""run on its own"" perfectly according to his will, just like a watch can run on its own according to the watchmaker's will (i.e. how fast it should tick, in which direction should it go, ...)

So, if God is perfect, omniscient and omnipotent, why couldn't he have created the universe just like a watch, which then runs on its own in such a way that it represents God's will?

Can something be wrong but not a sin?",Minimum_Incident186,1624941819,"Hello, I would like to thank the people who commented on the last time I posted here, you were all very helpful. I'm not a Catholic yet but I have contacted my local church and hopefully I will be able to muster up the courage to undergo RCIA this or next year, and I'll see what happens. Unfortunately, due to who I was in the past I do feel quite alone in my investigation of religion, my friends and family are quite atheistic and my country, like many others, is getting more atheistic with every passing decade. I don't think it's a good idea to only think about these ideas alone, lest you come to the wrong conclusion, so I have to come here again for your opinions. I would like you to  point out any flaws or errors in my thinking. Anyway, post now:

One of the classic atheistic arguments is the Euthyphro Dilemma. I would answer this question by saying that an action is good or wrong is a fundamental metaphysical property of the action itself. The action is, has always been, and always will be wrong. For example, something which is wrong, will always be wrong, no matter how many variables are added to the equation. Do you have an issue with this interpretation?

Anyway, assuming that is true, this does lead me to a few questions. In the example of killing, let's take it that it is objectively wrong. If a cop is to kill a suspect unjustly, that is clearly wrong and is therefore a sin. But if a cop is to kill a suspect justly (in the case of someone who is in the process of pulling a gun in order to fire upon officers), that would still be wrong because killing is fundamentally, but it is necessary to prevent the greater wrong of the criminal killing the cops, and also to preserve law and order in the civil society. If it is a wrongful act, but it is necessary, therefore it is not a sin. Is this is a correct understanding of sin, that it is distinct to wrongfulness, but often overlaps. Do Catholics believe that everything which is wrong is a sin? Should a cop who has killed suspects justly go to confession for those killings?

Another example would be abortion when the mother's life is at risk. If we say that abortion is objectively wrong then it follows that abortion when the mother's life is at risk is also wrong. However, it is again necessary, because it would be a greater wrong to let the mother die (if we assume this situation is literally ""you're going to die if we don't terminate immediately""), and is not a sin, although it is wrong. Am I wrong? Forgive me if this is an asinine scenario.

Would that be a mortal sin for the action hero, for every person killed that wasn't necessarily going to kill them right away, but most likely would trap or kill you or your family if they detected you (like say you sneak into their compound and snap a guards neck from behind. the guard is only a threat because you are trespassing in a restricted area, but you could argue that you are doing so for justified reasons). Could a situation like this ever fall under just war, rendering the less-directly involved guards as enemy combatants in a sort of war?

Circumstantial Catholic with Questions,Intelligent-Ad5316,1624927749,"What does my confirmation mean for me?

I have such a complicated relationship with Catholicism. After my mother died I was placed with a family that I stayed with for a while which was Catholic, and they had me baptized, given my first communion, and confirmed all on the same day. I was 11, and my brother was 8. We'd had minimal religious schooling beforehand. (I only remember going to maybe 2-4, one hour long evening classes.)

As I got older I was eventually moved to a new (Southern Baptist) family before becoming independent on my 18th birthday. I've come to understand that my Catholic experience is far from normal. I do like the idea of confirmation, the idea that one makes a final choice at an appropriate age (generally junior year of high school for my peers) to make a permanent commitment to the faith. That seems so reasonable to me, but I feel like I was robbed of that opportunity.

I don't currently live as a Catholic. I'm an involved member in a Unitarian Universalist Church. The life I live is inherently at odds with the Catholic faith, (I am transgender and on medically necessary birth control) but I've made this commitment to the Catholic Church that I definitely still don't understand the depth of.

What does it mean to be a confirmed Catholic? Is my name on a list? Do I get included in Catholic statistics? Is there a way to remove myself? (No beef- I just want to be authentic. I am not Catholic and don't want to lie or be included where I'm irrelevant) If I decided to be Catholic again, would there be a way to make a more relevant, meaningful, adult commitment; since I feel like an 11 year olds confirmation lacks a a certain intentionality.

Someone in r/CatholicMemes said that no one is unfit for the Catholic faith (paraphrasing) but I feel like I am. I'm just not sure what my relationship with Catholicism is or means, and in this tradition more ancient than anything else in my life, I don't know where to start.

Sorry, I know this is a lot. I'm trying as hard as I can to he genuine and not negative. I've had hurt feelings about the faith in the past, and am trying to come fourth with understanding and curiosity to learn about the breadth of Catholicism, beyond just my narrow experience.",Catholicism

Facts aren’t always indicative of something from God,Gjak_Illir,1624921163,"Interesting part of the faith I’ve been reflecting on. Someone on here mentioned some old text of another religion that was anatomically correct and fearing that it was the correct religion because of how factual it was as we know now 

Could it have been faked and added in later? Possibly but I doubt it. On a similar vein, maybe someone visited a fortune teller and they knew so much about them and thought that it just had to be a “gift” from God. I think a key that I often forget is the intelligence God gave to angels 

Yes, Catholicism works with and embraces science and at the same time science isn’t a qualifier for Catholicism. Because God gave the angels, including the fallen ones, intellect that we cannot fathom and it could very well be coming from the other side 

“The natural intelligence of an Angel is common to both the good and the fallen angels, the demons. ‘Although an Angel’s intellect is not his own substance, just as our intellects are not our own substances, yet he possesses such penetration, that he is able, at one glance, to take in the whole field of science lying open to his perception, just as we, at a glance, can take in the entire field of vision lying exposed to our eyes.’”

  I'm a pretty new revert, and I'm not clear on the Church's teachings in regards to pets/animals. This weekend I'll be visiting my brother and his family, including my 6-year-old nephew. Their family dog died today; he's been there my nephew's whole life.

The Lord may have sacrificed himself for humanity but he also healed the nameless women who touched the hen of his garment.

Saint Francis may have been responsible for many miracles but he also helped lepers and treated them with respect.

There are so many other saints who did the same that sometimes miracles detract from their innate kindness.

I include myself in those who often negate the smaller things. Like saying good morning to a neighbor, helping an elderly person with their shopping, complimenting a co-worker on a job well done.

The most powerful and readily available conversion tool is kindness. We must never forget that small acts can go a long way. Although we must fight for our our faith, we must also live it. If we aren't doing these small, easy acts then our bigger actions are often without meaning.

Catholic Church's position on illegality of abortion vs. other sins,Educational_Skill736,1624914808,"I'm having trouble making sense of the Church's push to legally ban abortions, while not pushing for illegality in other areas considered morally abhorrent by the Church.  Playing devil's advocate, take adultery for example.  Adultery is explicitly condemned in the Ten Commandments.  Yet, as far as I know, the Church does not push for adultery to be treated as a criminal offense.  The Church's position on the morality of abortions and adultery is very clear and seems consistent, yet the Church's attitude towards these two subjects from a legal standpoint does not appear to be the same.  I understand upholding the sanctity of life is different from cheating on one's spouse, but adultery is still a mortal sin.  

I'm sure these questions are not new, and that many Catholic scholars have worked them through.  However I can't find a good source to answer this.

It’s kind of humiliating to admit this ( because it reflects badly on me) but it’s true. Maybe because of it but since I’ve grown in piety it seems the sharp fangs and long claws of the world at large haven’t retracted in the least, it’s ice cold heart warmed up barely a degree, If that much.

""What can be called more sordid,  more void of modesty, more full of shame than prostitutes, brothels and  every other evil of this kind? Yet remove prostitutes from human affairs, and you will pollute all things with lust; set them among  honest matrons, and you will dishonour all things with disgrace and   turpitude"", Saint Augustine, De Ordine II.4 

""In human government . . . those who are in authority rightly tolerate  certain evils, lest certain goods be lost, or certain greater evils be  incurred: thus Augustine says: “If you do away with harlots, the world  will be convulsed with lust.” Hence, though unbelievers sin in their  rites, they may be tolerated, either on account of some good that ensues  therefrom, or because of some evil avoided."" Saint Thomas Aquainas

""Prostitution  is like the filth in the sea, or a sewer  in the palace. Take away the  sewer, and you will fill the palace with  pollution; and likewise with  the filth (in the sea). Take away  prostitutes from the world, and you  will fill it with sodomy"". Saint Thomas Aquinas in Opuscula XVI

""In lustful men lust plants deeper roots through easy and frequent sex  with prostitutes; and so, when the frequency of this vice increases all  the more, they do not cease committing pollution and heinous sins \[i.e.,  graver sexual sins that sex with prostitutes was supposed to prevent\] .  . . and therefore they do not abstain from soliciting upright women. On  the other hand, when prostitution is permitted other innumerable evils  are added \[e.g., more prostitutes are created, children are corrupted,  and marriage is devalued\].""  Saint Alphonsus Liguori 

Now what do I want to point out here? We all know and agree that Church teaches that prostitution is a grave sin and also sex outside marriage is a grave sin but we can see that these Saints said that it is better to tolerate prostitution lest certain goods be lost, or certain greater evils be incurred. Now we can all figure out the examples and we can understand their point here and they used the example of prostitution but the concept of ""lest certain goods be lost, or certain greater evils be incurred"" can be applied to other things as well.

We know that abortion is very serious moral issue and it should be number 1 when it comes to guiding us how to vote but also there are other things that are sinful but yet politicians get a pass with it. For example Catholic Church is against divorce but yet no one puts emphasis on this issue whatsoever. Can we vote for the politicians that support divorce? Should we ban divorce entirely? I think these issues have not been brought into politics for a long time. I know that there were many countries in Europe where divorce was illegal and it only became legal in like 80s.

I am not aware if Catholic Church has a position when it comes to voting for politicians that support sinful things. Yes there are documents that talk about abortion and euthanasia but it's not always that clear and we can see the reason now why US Bishops want to make a new document to make things clearer. I might be wrong but I believe that Joe Biden thinks that he did nothing wrong so therefore he sees no point in banning him to receive Communion.

Pope Benedict XVI (then Cardinal and  Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) issued a document called [""Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion: General Principles""](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/worthiness-to-receive-holy-communion-general-principles-2153) 

In that document the interesting and controversial passage is this one:

 “A Catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in evil, and so  unworthy to present himself for Holy Communion, if he were to  deliberately vote for a candidate precisely because of the candidate’s  permissive stand on abortion and/or euthanasia. When a Catholic does not  share a candidate’s stand in favor of abortion and/or euthanasia but  votes for that candidate for other reasons, it is considered remote  material cooperation, which can be permitted in the presence of  proportionate reasons.” 

Now remote material cooperation occurs when one does an action that is not sinful in and of itself and where he does not endorse the evil that his action facilitates. And someone can understand from this passage that it is not immoral to support women right to decide to abort but you must bear in mind that abortion is a grave sin. Maybe this made Joe Biden stating his position like that and that's why I said clearer statements need to be made.

So I want to hear you opinions on these points like when it comes to divorce, should we advocate to ban it completely or should we allowed this ""lest certain goods be lost, or certain greater evils be incurred"". Also what about the issue of contraception? Church is against contraception but no politician has any plan to ban it, and the question is should we ban it because it's a sin?

I am aware that Church doesn't advocate for theocracy and that state should be independent from the Church but then we should make clear border where we draw a line. Do we draw a line only to abortion and we can tolerate the rest? Or should we tolerate everything? Or maybe make illegal everything that it's sinful? I can give another examples on things that are sinful but legal and not Catholic and Catholic politicians talks about it like for example divorce, contraception, fornication, adultery, using drugs for recreation, euthanasia, waging wars that are not defensive, allowing homosexuals to have ""marriage"" and sex, etc. There are really many points but where do we draw a line what to permit and what not? Maybe I am extreme but don't you think it's better to make illegal everything that is sinful or make everything legal lest certain goods be lost, or certain greater evils be incurred, then to permit something but forbid something else?

Yes I am aware that not all sins are equal and some sins have greater evil and of course I am not talking that we should punish sins of mind that doesn't involve a action or direct cooperation in evil. Let's just focus on those examples I mentioned because in the past those action used to be illegal and recently became to be legal and when I say recently I say from 80s.

And now let's discuss the most difficult topic of all which is abortion. Some argue that we should make abortion legal lest certain goods be lost, or certain greater evils be incurred. You might say that nothing good can come from supporting abortion and I agree with that but also we need to be aware of other things and I want to give an example of a country where banning abortion resulted in disaster.

Romania was a communist country from 1945 to 1989 and abortion was legal until 1966 when a new law was passed and it made abortion illegal (it was still legal in cases of rape and incest and for women older than 45 years, etc.). This law was not passed because of religion because obviously communists are atheist but it was passed because they wanted to increase the population. Contraception was also banned and as a result of this the population really increased. But also not everyone wanted to have 5 kids and as a result of that many women performed illegal abortions. In many cases those illegal abortions resulted in the death of both woman and baby and it is estimated that 500.000 women died because of illegal abortions from the period of 1966 to 1989 which is a big number for Romania that has 20 million population and bare in mind exact numbers cannot be known because media was not free then.

Abortions were performed by medics in most cases but they were not made in hospitals because at every gynecologist ordination there was 1 officer from secret police because they were aware of what was going on. Medics meet these ""patients"" in houses or hotels or elsewhere where it was more discrete and not that controlled. Some abortions were made by unprofessional but even in places like hotel the infection could occur because it's not a sterile place and often time medics would not be there during entire duration of killing the baby.

Also abortions were punishable by law and you could end up in jail for 10 years or more. There were medics that performed illegal abortions for big money and they all risked their lives. Also they passed the law that women younger than 45 needs to go frequently to gynecologist so they can know if one is pregnant so to track the baby so a woman cannot abort it. Also even if the country was so strict and it controlled you monthly to see if you are pregnant or not still some women performed abortions and also some people illegally smuggled contraception. It was not possible for them to go to other countries to perform abortions because you were not permitted to leave the country in communist Romania.

Many women could not support such big families and they would give a birth but throw away the baby or they left babies in front of orphanages and as a result Romania had the higher number of orphanages in the world. Those kids were treated very bad, many died of hunger, many were abused and abused sexually. Very few kids turned out normal from those orphanages, many of them were having mental disabilities and were not even able to communicate. Almost all of them after Communism went down in 1989 and orphanages were closed all kids went to live on the streets and became criminals. Even among those who lived with their parents were treated bad because they didn't want to have that many kids so we can imagine the lack of love in a family with unwanted kids.

You can read more about this situation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decree_770) and please do read to see how it was. Also there is [a great movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Months,_3_Weeks_and_2_Days) about how some girl wanted to get illegal abortion during those time. There is a controversial hypothesis on how legalization of abortion will reduce the crime rate, you can read more about it [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect#Donohue_and_Levitt_study)

Many countries that were more free in Europe that had illegal abortions went to other countries to perform the abortion. This was case in Spain and Ireland where it was known that women went in other countries to perform abortions and they also had cases of illegal abortions in their countries that also resulted in death of both woman and baby. And even today in Europe in countries where abortion is illegal (Poland) they can go and have abortion in the neighboring country. I believe that there is no obstacle for someone from Alabama where abortion is illegal to go and have abortion in California where it is legal, right?

So in the case of Romania was tolerating abortion in 90s a good thing because it ended up those horrors that resulted from banning abortion? You be the judge. Also I want to remind you that I do not advocate for legalizing abortion but I want to have a discussion on those points that I mentioned, should we allow certain evils for the benefit of all or should be ban all evils and also should we be denied communion if our belief differentiates from our political ideas.

Thank you for reading and I hope I will not be understood wrongly because this is only a discussion and the examples do not reflect my beliefs because I always voted for the parties that wanted to make abortion and euthanasia illegal. More so I want to discuss other sins and their legality and support from political standpoint and whether one should be denied Communion if he doesn't agree that divorce should be banned. Maybe I will play a little devil's advocate in the comments but just for the sake of discussing and not opposing your opinion because honestly it's a difficult discussing in regards to these things.",Catholicism

"No, Gary Wills, the Bishops Aren't Wrong About Abortion",Catholic-Apologist,1624885409,"Today The New York Times published an op ed by Gary Wills titled ""The Bishops are Wrong About Biden -- and Abortion"". Available [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/27/opinion/biden-bishops-communion-abortion.html).  The article throws every facile argument in favor of abortion against the wall and hopes something sticks with NYT's largely pro-choice audience.  Surely Wills will win the popularity contest, but he doesn't score any points in logic or theology.  Here is a recap of Wills' arguments and my objections:

&amp;#x200B;

* Argument 1: Wills begins by claiming that abortion is not condemned anywhere in the Bible; that St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and others did not condemn it.  As to Pope Pius XI's Casti Connubi, which forbids all attempts to prevent procreation, Wills argues that the Pope just misread scripture.  
   * Response: All of this argument wrongly assumes that the Church cannot issue new teachings in response to novel problems.  It makes sense that the authors of scripture and the early Church fathers did not address this issue; in those days, there was not an industrial medical apparatus killing millions of infants in the womb.  Of course, the Church is not bound to forbid only what scripture forbids, because we believe that the Church is the living body of Christ guided by the Holy Spirit.  Thus Pope Francis can write an entire encyclical about the environment, guided by other Church fathers, despite the fact that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John did not know what carbon emissions were.

&amp;#x200B;

* Argument 2: Wills argues that, by the Church's logic, God is in an abortionist because half of fertilized eggs do not achieve nidation - i.e., adherence to the ovum.  He then brashly proclaims that his fingernail clippings are no more or less ""human life"" than a fertilized egg that doesn't make it.
   * Response:  This line of argument has consequences Wills does not seem to apprehend.  If we can attribute all natural incidents to God, then God would not only be the greatest abortionist but also the greatest mass murderer by means of tornados, tsunamis, plagues, etc.  The reality is that God allows bad things to happen in nature and we don't know why.  That is the classic problem of evil; not a warrant to ourselves emulate that which we attribute to God, and commit mass murder.

&amp;#x200B;

* Argument 3: Wills then makes several emotional appeals, using anecdote - not logic - as his guide.  He talks about how some legislatures are trying to criminalize infanticide; that in the 1960s, his parish priest did not take a position on abortion; and that his mother did not see any reason to bury her miscarriages.
   * Response:  Our historical treatment of fetuses has literally no bearing on what is true. This is nota condemnation of Wills' priests or grandmother; it's just to say that there is nothing meritorious in this line of argument.  Furthermore, the belief that a fetus is a human life does not necessitate that we punish abortionists to the same degree that we punish murderers; or bury fetuses like we bury those who have died of old age - there are other factors that can influence our decisions about how to meet out punishment and bury the dead.

&amp;#x200B;

* Argument 4: A majority of natural law experts and the population in general does not oppose abortion.
   * Response:  Truth is not a popularity contest.",Catholicism

Feeling increasingly scandalized by the Latin Mass,barchive22,1624859442,"I'm a former atheist and - how terrible of me - very poor. I've been attending latin mass daily for about 3 months and coming early and staying late to read my Bible and pray rosaries. The liturgy is amazing and I love everything about the experience except the other Catholics and their dirty looks and snide comments.

High Mass today just sucked. All these rich white people staring at me mean mugging me. Glaring at me in line to confession, glaring at me in the pew, glaring at me praying my rosary. All the little comments. I drank too much water an hour before mass and had to go to the bathroom, I waited until Eucharist so I could slip out and everyone wouldn't stare at me. Then all I could think about was how I shouldn't go to the bathroom or everyone will think I'm stealing the Eucharist because I'm not dressed in a $2,000 suit like it's a fucking wedding. Had an awkward exchange with the usher by the bathroom because I was so anxious I just felt like I should ask him to look at my tongue so everyone wouldn't think I was spitting in the Eucharist in the toilet. I didn't because I decided I was being crazy so I was just awkward instead.

But I just got nothing out of mass at all. Complete waste of time. I can stick to the low mass, but why should I be segregated into the lesser rite by these weirdos who act like I have leprosy? I feel stupid for how excited I used to be to go to church.

I've been to some ordinary form vernacular masses (novus ordo) and I just don't like anything about them. At this point I'm too traditional for them too, I don't like being the only one with a rosary or listening to Amazing Grace on piano instead of Asperges Me or being the only one to kneel for communion on the tongue.

But I feel like the Latin Mass parishioners are turning me back into an atheist. Sorry I'm not rich, assholes! 🤷 I just lost my job, the fuck do you want? I wear the nicest clothes I own every day and am doing laundry every couple days so they're clean.

I don't see how I can keep going to mass every day like I have been and I don't get anything out of the new mass. I can go to a Byzantine mass on Sundays but it feels like a loss to go to church once a week instead of 7-9 masses.

Any advice? I have a miserable life and daily mass has been the only thing I have to look forward to every day. Honestly I'm thinking I might have to look into Islam again. If this is the one true church maybe that's not worth as much as I thought it was.",Catholicism
This is your friendly reminder that there are 163 days left in the Year of St. Joseph,Ozzurip,1624858826,"For the Year of St. Joseph, Pope Francis has (once again) decided to be recklessly generous with the Church’s treasury of grace over which he is custodian.

* Praying that those in need of work can find it
* Meditating 30 minutes on the Lord’s Prayer
* Perform spiritual or corporal works of mercy
* Recitation of the rosary in the family
* Entrust daily activity to St. Joseph’s protection
* Recite the Litany of St. Joseph

When I join Catholic community activities (bible classes, meditations, confession, Masses), my parents aren't happy nor supportive at all. They'll say that the priests are talking nonsense, and they were so happy when all my confessions got cancelled cos of covid. And they're throwing lots of shade by name-calling or criticising my confirmational Godmother ever since we met each other. She's stayed away from us too. 

But then many times they'll brag to me how they managed to pray one whole rosary without my knowledge that it's family rosary time, since I'm in the showers. I take a long time in the showers because it's so difficult to move around in the shower, and they don't want to help me anyway, even to the point of scolding me when I fall down and cry for help, or when I need help for fallen objects. I work late into the night due to the nature of my job, so sometimes I can only join the rosary session for about 2 decades, sometimes I've to skip rosary, but I definitely attend when I can.

The last straw that I've had was two weeks ago, when they asked me to ask my former regular confessor for house blessing. (Cos of covid, now I've no more regular confessor.) But my parents kept postponing the blessing and expressing their refusal to even go for confession upon the priest's request. They've never gone to him for confession before. So, they wasted Father's precious time and made him feel unwelcome, and Father himself cancelled the blessing in the end because he was uncomfortable with us, and he's pissed off at us for wasting his time. He also told me not to contact him unless absolutely necessary. And I almost lost my confessor... Thankfully he told me that I can still see him for confession.

I got paranoid when I felt tingling in, well, I'm not gonna post it. But anyways, I got to confession recently, but I still felt tingling in the church. And even when I was in a state of Grace, I felt tingling still.

Questions in regard to Islam,Jaded-Mixture8465,1624847274,"Hello everyone, I come from an Orthodox family and I love my religion, but recently the existence of Islam has begun to make me severely doubt my faith. I come from a country with a Muslim majority population and recently many Muslim's have exerted a great deal of effort in trying to convince me to convert to Islam and I can't help but find many of the points brought up by many Muslim missionaries and apologists rather compelling, for example, they have pointed to various verses in the Quran and hadith that can be verified by modern science such as accurate descriptions of functions of the human anatomy and natural phenomena including descriptions the development of the human embryo or it's descriptions on the structure of mountains among many others. Another reason that has made me begin to lose faith is the fact that Muhammad was illiterate and had too low of a social status to learn to compose poetry, and the quality of writing in the Quran is undeniably extremely high and is regarded even in Secular circles as one of the greatest works of Arabic literature which is a point many Muslims cite to support their belief that the Quran was not written by a human hand (essentially that Muhammad would not have been able to write the Quran on his own). There is also a fear factor that has caused me to be this unsettled, a literal reading of the Quran would strongly suggest that I would go to Islamic Hell if I were to remain Orthodox which has made me consider leaving my faith out of sheer anxiety as to my fate if I end up wrong. I am studying very hard about both Islam and Orthodoxy and I want to hear why you from a logical, scientific, and theological standpoint do not believe Islam to be true so as to help me determine which faith to follow.

Edit: I'm not so much looking for why you think I should believe in Christianity as I am looking for why you think I should not believe in Islam, if I am sufficiently convinced that Islam is not true I will automatically remain Orthodox",Catholicism

Are these reasons why I want to start receiving on the tongue prideful or flawed? (explained below),throwawayjdkdbdj,1624843967,"So without giving too many specific details, I will be moving to a new parish soon. From what I can tell, I am worried about the fact that it may be more on the heterodox side (potentially, I do not want to presume. but on the surface it appears as though it may be the case). 

As a separate issue, I have been thinking about wanting to start receiving on the tongue for a while now, but because I am often assisting in some way on the altar when I’m at Mass, I haven’t wanted to just switch my method of receiving and catch the priest by surprise. I am also hesitant to just start doing it at this parish because I am mildly concerned that me switching the way I receive could be perceived as me being prideful or looking down on others who don’t receive on the hand (which I obviously would not be doing). 

To be clear, the first reason above all that I am doing this is that I’ve had some difficulties with trying to comprehend the mystery of the True Presence and I feel as though receiving on the tongue would help me be more reverent to the Sacrament and better internalize its importance.

(tl;dr below)

**However, my question is: 
Would choosing to start this practice when I move to this new parish, with the secondary intention of being a reverent witness to a place that may need such a person, be a flawed motivation for doing so?** 

Again, I want to stress that I wouldn’t be doing this because I think I am anyone special, nor because I want to appear extra pious to anyone. But rather I would be doing this because I feel this may be a part of a greater call God is placing on my heart to help bring this parish to orthodoxy.

James 2:19 and what I believe to be a miracle,Gjak_Illir,1624843264,"To preface and add a sort of warning, I am speaking of an ordained Roman Catholic priest who is assigned to a diocese , warning is more so that his alleged stigmata isn’t officially recognized by the church

Went to one of his masses when I was a bit agnostic and didn’t know even if God existed and was lacking in that belief. Bored in the back not caring to pay attention, with my sibling when I started shaking and assumed it to be a scared reaction to my sibling having a kind of dyspnea reaction. Later learned that he said something along the lines of and in a language that I don’t personally understand - (paraphrasing as I was too embarrassed to elaborate) some of you may feel God and if you are in a state of mortal sin you may feel afraid and start to tremble

Whether you believe this/me or not, this apparent miracle gave me the same kind of faith as the demons where my full fledged belief in God and the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church are taken as fact and I saw myself as savable despite being in a near constant state of mortal sin

But I have also used it as this Bible passage warns and I am glad that I have finally recognized it in myself that it’s not enough. Still in a near constant state of mortal sin but I keep yearning to get back, met with and reached out to priests on numerous occasions, to prepare myself for confession and even now I yearn for mass which I haven’t been to since even before the covid shutdowns

Copied from my Facebook. Forgive the incoherence. I needed to get this off my chest.,Scorpions13256,1624838067,"As many of you are aware, Catholic churches across Canada are being vandalized and burnt down in response to the Native American boarding schools. The Canadian government, however, seems to not be getting any blame for this. 

On social media, far more people are praising this than condemning it. The people who are supporting this call themselves ""tolerant"" and ""progressive."" As a matter of fact, many of these people have LGBT flags and Canadian flags for profile pictures, absolving the government of any responsibility. They fail to see the irony in burning down churches in the name of ""tolerance"" and ""progress."" They have simply traded homophobia and misogyny for anti-catholicism. 

Harming civilians and rioting is counterproductive because it turns public opinion away from your cause. It may also have the unintended effect of making the Catholic church less likely to apologize to feel more ""in control"" of things.  The more you engage in violence, the more you divide society and turn it into a gloomy place.

In addition to all this, more extreme people are calling for churches to close down or be taxed at ludicrous levels. This is a sign that persecution may follow if trends continue.

Line drawing questions regarding idols/wicca in the Catholic tradition,Sheru05,1624834239,"Let me preface this by asking to please not attack; I have been transitioning to Catholicism for a few years and I am genuinely curious/have questions! If you find this offensive, I can understand why, but I am just curious and looking for guidance so I ask that you please move on rather than say mean things about it. I've looked online and not found much on point with my specific questions. 

Obviously you cannot worship pagan gods or practice any sort of magic/sorcery/etc., so that's not what I am wondering. I have always found the practice of appreciating nature (the way our environments work, the way physics/biology work) to be very spiritually meaningful to me and it is one of the main ways that I feel close to the Lord. Centering myself through mindfulness meditation and appreciation of my surroundings brings me a sense of peace like no other and I always thank God throughout the process. I've recently been informed this is not good and borders on wicca? 

I recently started learning about some pagan tradition, just out of curiosity, and it seems like there are many similarities. I have a few specific questions. I know most catholics/christians don't believe in crystals, but many believe that rosaries can provide divine protection? Why is there a difference? 

Many candles used in Catholic contexts mirror those used in the occult. So why is this allowed but when other people do it, it's not allowed? 

Why are some statues allowed for Catholic purposes? I know there was the whole debacle w/Pope Francis and the Amazon figures not too long ago. I just don't understand why some statues would be idols and others not? 

Regarding witchcraft, where is the line? What is a spell/potion versus legitimate medicine? I know of the argument that it is not right to step in and try to take control away from God. But I don't see why that would apply to folk medicine and not to modern medicine. I think modern medicine would actually have a much stronger argument against it, but I would still take my child to the doctor if they got an infection or something. I am just confused about the rules and rationale and I am genuinely looking for some guidance to better understand the Catholic tradition and belief system.

My conversion to Catholicism,bearcrk,1624833180,"I grew up in the Midwest, and so like many who did, grew up as a sort of generically non-denominational but protestant Christian. Neither of my parents really went to Church, I'd sometimes go with my grandma but it wasn't frequent. Regardless of my parent's very relaxed view on Church attendance, they were both very hardcore ""Christians"" - hated gay people, believed in hell and talked about it a lot, but also found solace in Christ and God. My parents don't believe in evolution or the big bang theory, etc.

So, you can imagine that enter middle/high school, being a smart kid, I abandoned all of that pretty quickly. I felt that I was smarter than my parents, smarter than most of my family, certainly smarter than every Christian who believed in a stupid made up sky-fairy friend. Certainly smart enough to know that people don't raise from the dead. I engaged with atheism pretty regularly and frequently debated on the topic in school, with friends, etc.

I've always had a pretty strong desire to know things, and to pursue truth and knowledge when I could. Late high school, like many atheists, I had come to be very pessimistic and nihilistic, essentially realizing that while I thought atheism might be *right,* in and of itself it offered to real prescriptions of behavior or worldviews. I explored some basic philosophy, trying to build up a moral framework around myself. A lot of Nietzsche, mostly. I explored some eastern religions, believing that because they were ""less obvious"" than Christianity and monotheism, they must be true, or at least be *more true*.

An important cornerstone for me was the discovery of *hygge*, a danish concept that can be best summarized as comfort and gratitude. It gave me a framework for being happy - by being grateful for things. It began a series of self-discipline, eating proper meals so I'd be more grateful for them, stopping to actually complete tasks and be grateful for a job well done. Simple stuff.

Along my philosophy journey, I encountred Søren Kierkegaard. I could reconcile a lot of his writing, even though explicitly Christian, with my vaguely-eastern-atheistic-skeptical-but-""open-minded"" view of the world. I start to realize that most of my conception of morality, objectivity, ethics, etc., were really just stolen from Christianity, given a different name, etc. Encountering the work of Dr. Jordan Peterson furthered this realization. His Biblical series on Genesis helped me to understand that there can be deep truths within literature, even if its not a literal truth.

From here, I came to the conclusion that, at least as a prescriptive worldview, Christianity was ""right"". At this point, I was about to finish my first year of college, or just starting my second year of college, I don't remember which. Like Peterson I often said that I ""act as if God exists"" (altho I really didn't). Eventually I came to just cut it short and say that I believe God exists, which was more or less true by this point. Altho I still struggled with some Gnostic/Mystical ideations about God - that He is the Universe, and that all religions held the same truth expressed in different ways. Like a universalist that held onto the Christian manifestation.

A lot of this changed when I started reading theologians like Thomas Aquinas and early Christian writers like St. Augustine, or apologists like CS Lewis and the like. Through a long, hard battle I eventually settled on the conclusion that Christianity was not only *right* as a prescription, but *right* in terms of what it actually describes. When I explored Christianity on this grounds, then I had a simple goal - determine which denomination is true. This exploration led me to Catholicism, I can go into the details of why I believe Catholicism to be the truest expression of Christianity, but in short its because I went back to which church was the closest to Christ in history. A lot of people debate it, but to me its the Catholic Church.

I appreciated that the Catholic Church didn't oppose reason, and that most of my objections to the Christianity of my parents was either answered by the Church, or at least offered room for interpretation or choice. For things I didn't agree with, there was a rich well of teachings and explanations for it. 

I started just ""pretending"" to be a Catholic - dipping my fingers in the holy water, genuflecting before entering the pew, attending adoration, praying the Rosary. And the weird thing was, it worked. Prayers started being answered. I questioned the papacy and was given satisfying answers. I questioned sacred tradition and apostolic succession and found the answers to my objections fully satisfied what I was looking for. Catholicism, to me, seemed rational, intellectual, and reasonable. Orthodoxy and Protestantism, by contrast, seemed emotional and irrational. 

In my process of conversion, the one thing I truly struggled with was the Eucharist. While I could intellectually accept the deep metaphysics of transubstantiation, I didn't really *feel* it emotionally.

If this was the end of the story, I would still be a Catholic. I'm convinced that its true, I came to it purely out of an intellectual pursuit.

What is the proof of Saint Dominic's Apparition?,Shanea10,1624828962,"As title says, just curious on what the proof of Saint Dominic's Apparition is and when it was firstly recorded in history. I know the apparition was highly likely, and I don't doubt it one bit, but I am looking for additional proof I guess is all. 

To start, I know that there is no records of the Marian Rosary existing in the post-Saint-Dominic-apparition form at all, and Saint Dominic became famous as a result of his work, which is some supporting proof to begin with. But the counter-argument to this could always be ""Well he didn't record the apparition at all, and he could have always just made it up"" (even though I think it is unlikely he made it up, it is still a counter-argument nonetheless)

Additionally, I know Saint Dominic himself didn't have any writings, but did other Dominicans write down what he told them (about his apparitions and such) and then the writings about Saint Dominic and his apparition got passed down from generation-to-generation? Or alternatively, were the details of the apparition told by Saint Dominic himself to Blessed Alan when he appeared to him, and that is the first time the apparition of Saint Dominic was recorded in History?

In Germany there are non-celibate gay couples being blessed by the Bishops. In National Catholic Reporter they're pushing some pop singer whose music is about sin and who is a legally married lesbian who talks about how important her ""Catholic identity"" is to her. I read on here all the time how people are struggling with sexual sin, stopping for a day or two, confessing and receiving the sacrament. If you can't establish a pattern of clean living, that doesn't sound like contrition to me. I read just yesterday about how there are apparently women getting indefinite dispensations from the birth control rules over uncomfortable cycles or economic hardship. These people are obviously getting support from priests and Churches who are letting these things slide, and then the priests are just as stuck in reprehensible sin of their own. My diocese probably dispenses more settlement checks to the victims of abuser priests than they do sacraments at this point. Doesn't that weaken the ability of the Church to say what's right when it matters? If they're willing to say that the Church is wrong on one thing, they're probably willing to say the Church is wrong on another thing, and nobody really bats an eyelid while the credibility of the Church falls to pieces. Why does no-one seem to enforce anything? It's all just big talk online and in official documents, the situation is the same as it ever was - everyone does what they want and communion gets taken and taken for granted. 

What gives? Is all of this about Church teaching being part of Catholicism just bluster?

I converted from nondenominational Protestantism after trying to disprove Catholicism unsuccessfully. It moves from the concept of the importance of objective truth into a critique of Martin Luther as a reliable figure for doctrinal reformation and the logical implications of the necessity of any sort of doctrinal reformation for Christ’s church, and then moves into the bulk of the content regarding Typology and a biblical, historical, and logical defense of the Eucharist. 

I also have a second book about 80% ready that covers the Papacy, Sola Scriptura, the Saints, Purgatory, and Salvation, all defended using typology, scriptural arguments, and including a LOT of citations from the Church Fathers. 

I’ve learned a lot since I wrote this, but at the same time I consider it to be the most exhaustive defense of these doctrines available to the average lay person without investing months-years of time and lots of money on research. It includes basically all the best arguments available for free and in the 40 or so books I was able to read over the course of three years of in depth research.

I am not sure what to do.,Draghia_Petra,1624797814,"Should I convert in secret, without telling my parents? (My dad would dislike it highly and even though I am not sure what he might do, it is possible that he will not allow me to attend Mass and maybe even practice my faith at all.) 



Or should I wait 3 years until I graduate to do it?



If I convert in secret, the only problem is that I will not be able to attend Mass all the time (and I am very much aware this is pretty bad), and when I would, that means I would have to tell my parents I am just going out with my friends, and I don't want to lie but there is nothing else that I can do...



I still haven't contacted the priest from the local parish, but I have a feeling he might want my parents' approval for my Confirmation, and that's why I feel very stuck and unsure to what to do.

"Marriage Advice: Alcohol, Masturbation, Pride, etc.",shounen-no-haato,1624797392," 

I have two problems I want to ask advice for from other practicing Catholics, especially those of you who are married... The first is that my husband is a ""high-functioning alcoholic. It's really tiring! What I want to know is, ***what are my obligations as a Catholic wife? How do I handle this?***  
His family enables him and has soft-alcoholic tendencies themselves. His closer friends do as well. (And they would probably downplay some his actions and effects from drinking probably if I told them.

He has made some incredibly bad decisions through the alcohol, but he swings back and forth from acknowledging it to sort of softly downplaying the severity of some of those things. (One time cops literally came to search our house because he posted something questionable. And I could write up a whole thing about that affair on its own.) He also starts comparing his alcohol to what he says is actually his worse addiction (like I need to focus on it more or something?): porn/masturbation.  
And yes, those really do cause tons of problems too. I think that is another thing to address, but he doesn't do that around me anymore so I don't know how or when to address that either.

It's rarely brought up on its own, just mostly when I try to talk about the problems with the alcohol. And literally any attempt I take to deal with the problem directly is seen as some kind of challenge to his authority or manipulation, etc. He's very sensitive to feeling like his manhood or authority is being challenged. It also plays into his porn issues to an extent. And so you can probably imagine, he doesn't have any desire to share his problem with people seriously or do something like therapy...

My second question is -- ***is it unjust if I don't want to have a child right now because of this situation?*** At one point I told him that I really didn't want to. He seemed really hurt by this and said we shouldn't have sex anymore then. Or rather, maybe he was saying that's what I was saying. (After all, 'I don't want to have a child with you right now' would mean I'm not open to life.) I've never denied him sex before, even to the point of him having called in 'the marital debt' at least once when I really didn't want to. But right now, yeah I guess I am denying him. Is this unjust? Am I wrong to feel this way?

He said he didn't care why I said it, having a child isn't something that's supposed to be 'conditional'. I'm pretty sure he thinks it's some kind of emotional manipulation to like have him whipped or something, like 'if you don't do what I want you, can't have a kid with me' kind of thing. But in my head I'm really struggling to see why it's wrong? I mean things are really bad right now. And they were already quite less than ideal when we got married. I feel like I was really foolish back than to think that although he had red flags, he had the ability to work on them just because I'd seen him make some promise of changes back at the height of our affection for each other. It sucks because we both do actually want kids and we're heading to our mid-30s so it's really important to get a move on. What do I do? I feel like I'm at a standstill.

"[Personal Experience] The Lord, our God truly sees all of us.",Eroldin,1624791886,"Let me first explain my situation: I suffer from multiple disabilities: I'm autistic, I have ADHD and I also suffer from a anxiety disorder and diabetes.

My Anxiety disorder affects my blood glucose levels, which makes me suffer from anxiety even more. This vicious circle, leads to great instability in my diabetic live, and lots of late nights (living on my own, alone doesn't help as well...).

This leads to me missing a lot of Early Sunday masses (late Sunday masses are not available in my town, and taking my out my bike for a long ride, messes up my diabetes even more).      
For this reason, I try to go to the Thursday evening mass (which I sadly have to miss a lot as well).

This night, I had the same problem; my blood glucose level was unstable once again, but luckily it stabilized around 2:00 AM. Tired, thanks to quite the unstable week I had, I thought: Let me watch the service on T.V. and let my body rest from this disaster.

After taking my breakfast around 7 PM and returning to bed I got a dream where I was checking on my glucose level and got a reading of 10.2 mmol/L (or 183 mg/dL) which is a bit high, my mother gave me a sugar-free Red Bull and said: ""Your glucose level is fine, now go to church!"".

At that moment I woke up (it was around 9:30 AM) checked my glucose level (it was 10.2 mmol/L like my dream said!) got ready as fast as I could, took a Energy Drink and raced to church.

At mass, whilst listening to the pastor's sermon he said the following:

&gt;Know that God loves every human being. No matter if one is popular, unpopular, beautiful or not beautiful, healthy, unhealthy or disabled, loved by others or hated my others... even if you do not love yourself. God sees and loves you.

These where just the words I needed to hear. I've experienced quite a lot of suffering in my live, but not only knowing; but also realizing  that God's love rains down on me (and all of us!) strengthens me more than I could imagine.

Writing this down, also inspired me to quote Psalm 139:8

Issue with coveting others and how to look at the situation.,DependentShirt8089,1624779019,"Hello all,

I am a married man and am having some issues that I’m sure are more prominent than I realize.  Sometimes I will find myself regretting (in the sense I have feelings against) my choice in marriage.  I will tend to covet (think the grass is greener) others wifes, girlfriends, etc.

I think some of these problems stem from my getting married when I was not spiritually healthy or ready, and my own defects of my character.  With that being said I have a good wife and I don’t think this is a situation where I would be eligible for an annulment (or could morally justify it personally if it was).  All that to say I think God is calling me to will the good of my wife and push her towards salvation.

I guess I am just having issues with jealousy of others and their wife’s and coveting.  I say those things loosely because it’s more dealing with those feelings on a strong level.  I sometimes have to avoid settings where someone is with their wife or girlfriend lest I feel regret in my own marriage.  Is it ok to avoid these circumstances if they make me feel this way?  I’m admittedly mixing up action with feelings I get.  Are these feelings normal and what do I do with them in my walk towards Christ?

Is it a sin to bring snacks into a movie theater where doing so is against the rules?,heraclitus_ephesian,1624777464,"A lot of theaters have rules against bringing snacks in from the outside, but the temptation to do so is strong since movie theater snacks are exorbitantly expensive.

I’m leaning towards “yes, it is a sin” for two reasons:

- We should treat people as we wish to be treated, and if I owned a theater I would want people to follow the rules.
- Theaters depend on revenue from snacks to make money. In fact, from a business perspective, theaters are basically snack stores that show movies on the side.

But I can also think of reasons why it might not be a sin:

- It is not illegal to my knowledge (I’m in the U.S, but laws may be different elsewhere)
- If the options were “bring snacks” or “no snacks at all,” bringing snacks would have no impact on the theater’s revenue. But if it did,
- Theater prices are set to reflect the reality that some patrons will bring snacks

My heart just sorta breaks and I slip near doubt.

At least priests and the clergy voluntarily give this up, homosexuals don’t actually get a say in the matter. At times seeing this as disordered is as difficult as seeing the Eucharist. As the Eucharist is the body of Christ but appears to only be a cracker, so to are homosexual relationships sinful but appear innocent and without fault.

I can’t help but doubt, despair, or feel guilt. It is by sheer grace I’m straight, in their position I wouldn’t last a week. Let alone my whole life. It’s just a difficultly I deal with.

Examples of the Catholic Church defending the rights of indigenous peoples that radical Catholics and radical Christians can learn from,Anglicanpolitics123,1624762048,"I am a non Catholic speaking about the Catholic Church because I believe in being ecumenical. Furthermore I believe in consciousness raising and awareness. These are key parts of commitments to justice. Now in light of the mass graves and burial sites in Canada the issue of social justice for indigenous communities has come up. And not only Christians, but Catholics specifically are grappling with the connection between their institutional tradition and colonisation. Out of a commitment to justice and an Ecumenical commitment I want to point to an alternative tradition in the history of the Catholic Church that has been devoted to justice for indigenous people and anti colonialism. It involves activists, bishops, priests, Catholic spirituality, social teaching, down to the present. This does not erase things ranging from the Papal Bulls of Donation and the Doctrine of Discovery to Residential schools, Stolen Generations, Native American Boarding Schools etc. But it does provide an education tool that Radical Catholics and Radical Christians can use in embracing a liberation theology by knowing that they don't have to start from scratch or wander aimlessly or abandon or feel disillusioned with their own faith tradition in order to fight for justice. So here goes in terms of history and theology.

**(i)Historical Papal defenses of indigenous communities**

* Pope Paul III was the first Pope to defend the rights of indigenous communities in 1537 when he issued the Papal Bull called Sublimus Dei. In it he condemns those who engaged in the enslavement of the indigenous populations of the New World as well as colonialism in general stating that they were tools and ""allies of the Devil, the murderer from the beginning"". So from this Pope's perspective the colonisers were imitating Satan himself.
* Pope Urban VIII, the Pope of the Galileo Affair also initiated a defense of the indigenous communities of Paraguay condemning the Portuguese colonisers there through a Papal Bull that he wrote. He was such a dramatic document for its time that when it was read in Catholic Churches the settlers were so infuriated that they began burning down parishes and seminaries.
* Under Pope Innocent XI the Holy Office(which headed the Inquisition ironically) issued a directive that condemned both the African slave trade and the oppression of indigenous communities. Furthermore it surprisingly supported compensation and reparation to African and indigenous communities that were colonised or enslaved.
* Pope Pius X in 1912 issued an encyclical called Lacrimabili Statu which addressed the rights of indigenous peoples in Peru where he strongly denounced the rubber plantations for the exploitation of indigenous people and their labour and significant also condemned the missionaries there too for failing to defend the rights of the indigenous communities

**(ii)Bartolome De Las Casas and the Salamancan Monks**

* When Spain colonised the New World they established a system of labour called Encomienda which made indigenous people wards of Spanish lords who could exploit their labour for gold. This involved physical slavery, torture and sexual slavery. When the reports of the atrocities came back to main land Europe the Grand Inquisitor Cardinal Cisneros sent a team of Dominican monks from Salamanca in Spain to investigate the reports of atrocities.
* This delegation of monks was led by a man named Pedro De Cordoba and when they reached the island of Hispaniola and the monks saw the crimes committed the priest and monk named Antonio De Montesinos gave a famous Christmas sermon in 1511 denouncing the crimes of the conquistadors and threatening to deny them absolution until they repented famously stating ""by what right"" they had to do these things. Not only did Fr De Montesino's sermon denounce colonialism but surprisingly it tied justice for indigenous peoples with gender justice for indigenous women, a far reaching insight in terms of how colonialism and gender oppression intersect.
* One person who was inspired by this sermon was Bartolome De Las Casas who would end up kick starting the first human rights movement in world history to have encomienda abolished. He along with Francisco De Vitoria succeed in getting King Charles of Spain to develop the New Laws in 1542 that abolished encomienda in New Spain and helped set the stage for international law. Later on in 1556 De Las Casas manage to get the Spanish to abolish the Requiemento(Spanish requirement) that tied explicitly tied assimilation and conversion with conquest.

**(iii)The Jesuits in Latin America**

* The Jesuit missionaries in Latin America, particularly in Paraguay and other places surprisingly played a huge role in the protection of indigenous rights through the development of what were called reduccions, which were suppose to be utopian socialist like communities were indigenous communities were protected from the slave labour of the Portuguese. Because of this both the Portuguese and the Spanish regarded the Jesuits as enemies. In turn the Jesuits and the Guarani indigenous communities became allies where the Jesuits helped trained and arm militarily the Guarani communities in a 150 year guerilla campaign against the settlers.
* Eventually through treaty in 1750 the Spanish and Portuguese formed an alliance where they ended up invading the reducciones, conquering the Guarani after a long struggle and expelling the Jesuits permanently from Central and South America. Nevertheless that story of indigenous resistance through leaders such as indigenous resistance fighter and priest Sepe Tiaraju continue to inspire indigenous communities in Paraguay, Brazil and other places and Sepe himself as a resistance fighter is recognised as a Servant of God. Meaning he could be on the path to sainthood. A good film to watch on his life and the Jesuits in this region is the Mission produced in the 1980s.

**(iv)The Catholic Church in Paraguay under Stroessner**

* Paraguay fell under the dictatorship of a man named Alfredo Stroessner who instituted a policy of authoritarianism and human rights abuses. One was the genocide of indigenous groups. He initiated a forced assimilation policy called Indigenistas. It sought to forcibly assimilate the Ache and Enenhilt tribes while at the same time assigning land contracts to settlers from other Latin American countries such as Brazil or Uruguay as well as Canadian multinational corporations and settlers from the Canadian West. This campaign was initiated violently through torture, forced removals, the burning of homes, sexual violence against the wives of indigenous men, etc.
* The Catholic Church in Paraguay was the only institution in Paraguay that denounced this. They did this first through pilgrimages to the shrines of the Virgin Mary which became human rights marches. The second was consciousness raising through the dissemination of information to the uncontacted tribes that shared information of how Paraguayan law worked combined with pressure campaigns on the Paraguayan government and Senate. All of this culminated in Pope John Paul II's visit in 1987 which highlighted both human rights issues when it came to authoritarianism and the rights of indigenous people. Because of this high profile visit, it was used as a catalysts for indigenous activists, campesinos and human rights activists for mass protests and demonstration which led to the collapse of Stroessner and the end of his dictatorship.

**(v)The Catholic Church during the Guatemalan Civil War**

* The Guatemalan Civil War was a vicious conflict where the American backed dictatorship in the 1980s engaged in a policy of genocide of the Maya indigenous communities that led to the deaths of 200,000 people. Many Catholic priests, nuns and members of the Base Communities(grassroots solidarity movements centred on worship and Bible studies) laid down their lives in defense of the rights of indigenous communities.
* Eventually the Archdiocese of Guatemala stepped up and played a leading role both in negotiating an end to the Civil War and also leading Guatemala's Truth and Reconciliation Commission with the United Nations to investigate the crimes committed. As a result of this, many of the military leaders who committed crimes against indigenous peoples were put on trial and brought to justice and Guatemala as a nation ended up adopting international conventions such as the U.N convention on torture and the rights of the child.

**(vi)Catholic Social Teaching on the rights of indigenous peoples**

* ""“Whenever the truth has been suppressed by governments and their agencies or even by Christian communities, the wrongs done to the indigenous peoples need to be honestly acknowledged….The past cannot be undone, but honest recognition of past injustices can lead to measures and attitudes which will help to rectify the damaging effects for both the indigenous community and the wider society. The Church expresses deep regret and asks forgiveness where her children have been or still are party to these wrongs. Aware of the shameful injustices done to indigenous peoples in Oceania, the Synod Fathers apologized unreservedly for the part played in these by members of the Church, especially where children were forcibly separated from their families""\_Pope John Paul II(Ecclesia Oceania)
* ""Indigenous peoples....are not opposed to progress, yet theirs is a different notion of progress, often more humanistic than the modern culture of developed peoples. Theirs is not a culture meant to benefit the powerful, those driven to create for themselves a kind of earthly paradise. Intolerance and lack of respect for indigenous popular cultures is a form of violence grounded in a cold and judgemental way of viewing them. No authentic, profound and enduring change is possible unless it starts from the different cultures, particularly those of the poor. A cultural covenant eschews a monolithic understanding of identity of a particular place; it entails respect for diversity by offering opportunities for advancement and social integration to all""\_Pope Francis(Fratelli Tutt, prg 220)
* ""The businesses, national or international, which harm the Amazon and fail to respect the right of the original peoples to the land and its boundaries, and to self determination and prior consent should be called for what they are: *injustice and crime*. When certain businesses out for quick profit appropriate lands and end up privatising even potable water, or when local authorities give free access to the timber companies, mining or oil projects, and other businesses that raze the forests and pollute the environment, economic relationships are unduly altered and become an instrument of death. They frequently resort to utterly unethical means such as penalising protests and even taking the lives of indigenous peoples who oppose projects intentionally setting forest fires, and suborning politicians and the indigenous peoples themselves. All this is accompanied by grave violations of human rights and new forms of slavery affecting women in particular, the scourge of drug trafficking used as a way of subjecting the indigenous peoples or human trafficking that exploits those expelled from their cultural context. We cannot allow globalisation to become 'a new version of colonialism'""\_Pope Francis(Querida Amazonia prg 14)
* ""Since we cannot deny that the wheat was mixed with the tares and that missionaries did not always take the side of the oppressed, I express my shame and once more 'I humbly ask forgiveness not only for the offenses of the Church herself, but for the crimes committed against the native peoples during the so called conquest of the Americans, as well as for the terrible crimes that followed throughout the history of the Amazon region. I thank the members of the original peoples and I repeat: 'Your lives cry out....you are living memory of the mission that God has entrusted to us all: the protection of our common home""\_Pope Francis(Querida Amazonia Prg 19)
* ""Dialogue must not only favor the preferential option on behalf of the poor, the marginalised and the excluded, but also respect them as having a leading role to play. Others must be acknowledged and esteemed precisely as others, each with his or her own feelings, choices, and ways of living and working. Otherwise the result would be, once again, 'a plan drawn up by the few for the few; if not 'a consensus on paper or a transient peace for a contented minority'""\_Pope Francis(Querida Amazonia prg 27)
* ""It is essential to show special care for indigenous communities and their cultural traditions. They are not merely one minority among others but should be the principal dialogue partners, especially when large projects affecting their land are proposed. For them, land is not a commodity but rather a gift from God and from their ancestors who rest there, a sacred space with which they need to interact if they are to maintain their identity and values. When they remain on their they themselves care for it best. Nevertheless in various parts of the world, pressure is being put on them to abandon their homelands to make room for agricultural or mining projects which are undertaken without regard for the degradation of nature and culture""\_Pope Francis(Laudato Si prg 146)

So these are the historical and theological resources that radical Catholics, radical Christians and those who are committed to justice who are Christian or Catholic can draw from from their own faith tradition when addressing injustices against indigenous people. I think people should study these traditions. Internalise them. Make them practical along side studying things such as the TRC in Canada. Reflect on them along with the words of scripture that speak about justice.",Catholicism

Trouble discerning if this was sinful (lying/hiding things),ElessarofGondor,1624758834,Long story short my wife and I were forced to buy a new car in the current market (not ideal) we went to trade our old one at the first dealer which to our knowledge had a clean title and their check turned up that it had been in an accident but was not salvage. Called to get a quote from a second dealer to see if they could beat it and they told me it was a salvage title (first time I had heard it) we ended up going with the first one but I realised as we were paying for it that I didnt tell them the other dealer was claiming it was salvage. Was this wrong to do/deceitful? I had signed a document earlier that to my knowledge it was a clean title and to be fair the other dealer could have been lying about the salvage just to make me negotiate less (he still offered the same amount). I'm just feeling awful now that we didnt disclose that to the first dealer after we found out but at the same time we have no idea if it's true since through multiple registrations and insurance companies its always appeared clean.

How to find a new parish,Lemaitres_Waffles,1624757156,"Hello all, 

As the title entails, I am trying to find a new parish around my county. I used to drive about 45 minutes to go to my previous parish. I was very active there, the mass was very reverend, and it provided some great resources such as a young adult group, bible studies, and theology classes. The priest at the parish was also my spiritual director however he left the parish this week to become a hermit and now I am left without a spiritual father for the moment.

The commute proved to be rather tiring and the new priest that came in is already changing the parish up to become less reverent and accessible. (Moving evening daily masses to mornings, changing music from organ hymns to contemporary guitars, ect.). 

I would like to find another parish to ease my commute but also one that is just as reverent if not more to the one that I was attending and have the blessing of being able to do so. 

For those who may have been in a similar situation, how do you go about searching for that right parish for you? Specifically, what do you look for in a parish, the community, the priest, the liturgy, or even in their website? I have some ideas of my own but would like some suggestions.

The reason about jesus picture should dont exist(Gotquestion.org),Khangtupiddevil,1624753714,"The Bible nowhere gives a physical description of what Jesus looked like during His incarnation. The closest thing we get to a description is in Isaiah 53:2b, “He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to Him, nothing in His appearance that we should desire Him.” All this tells us is that Jesus’ appearance was just like any other man’s – He was ordinary-looking. Isaiah was here prophesying that the coming suffering Servant would arise in lowly conditions and wear none of the usual emblems of royalty, making His true identity visible only to the discerning eye of faith.
Most of the images we have of Jesus today are probably not accurate. Jesus was a Jew, so He likely had dark skin, dark eyes, and dark hair. This is a far cry from the european/Caucasian Jesus in most modern portrayals. One thing is clear: if it were important for us to know what He really did look like, Matthew, Peter and John, who spent three years with Him, would certainly be able to give us an accurate description, as would His own brothers, James and Jude. Yet, these New Testament writers offer no details about His physical attributes.(gotquestion.org)

We are all guilty of original sin,Ambitious_Ad_8339,1624730467,"**""Being a distinct** **person** **I am not strictly responsible for the crime of another; the act is not mine. Yet, as a member of the** **human** **family****, I am supposed to have acted with its** **head** **who represented it with regard to the conservation or the loss of grace. I am, therefore, responsible for my privation of grace, taking responsibility in the largest sense of the word. This, however, is enough to make the state of privation of grace in a certain degree** **voluntary****, and, therefore, ""without absurdity it may be said to be** **voluntary****"" (****St. Augustine****, 'Retract.', I, xiii). "" - Catholic Encyclopedia**

**""Furthermore, the act of sin performed by a member, say the hand or the foot, does not carry the notion of guilt from the hand’s or foot’s will but from the whole person’s will, from which as from a source the movement of sin is passed to the several members. Similarly, from the will of Adam, who was the source of human nature, the total disorder of that nature carries the notion of guilt in all who obtain that nature precisely as susceptible to guilt. And just as an actual sin, which is a sin of the person, is drawn to the several members by an act of the person, so original sin is drawn to each man by an act of the nature, namely, generation. Accordingly, just as human nature is obtained through generation, so, too, by generation is passed on the defect it acquired from the sin of the first parent."" - Saint Thomas Aquinas**

**Paragraph 404 of the Catechism: How did the sin of Adam become the sin of all his descendants? The whole human race is in Adam ""as one body of one man"". By this ""unity of the human race"" all men are implicated in Adam's sin, as all are implicated in Christ's justice.** 

In simpler words, just as our hand is guilty of sin because of its source, the will of the whole person, who chose to commit a sin like stealing, all mankind is guilty of sin because Adam, the source of our human nature, chose to commit a sin. Humanity is one body, one person, with Adam, and therefore we are guilty of his sin, just as our hand, which is one body, one person, with us, is guilty of any sin we commit.

Beauty and Goodness to Truth. In Memoriam of Hans Urs Von Balthazar who died today in 1988.,TJB74,1624726531," In a monumental work of 15 volumes he gathered the scattered achievements of the European theological, philosophical and literary tradition around this fundamental insight of approaching God through Beauty, Truth and Goodness.

* This work, is often referred to as a trilogy which was named Herrlichkeit (The Glory of the Lord), Theodramatik (Theo-Drama), and Theologik (Theo-Logic). By the end of this series, he hoped that theology would become once again, living, dynamic and glorious.
* He left the Jesuits when he formed a ""secular institute"". with Adrienne Von Speyer called the Community of Saint John in 1945, of consecrated laypeople established in 1945, with a mission to work for the sanctification of the world from within the world.
* However he did not leave the priesthood and five years later would be incardinated into the Diocese of Chur as a diocesan priest.

\----- 

* .Von Speyer, a mother in her late thirties, a doctor and a prominent figure in Basel society, had converted to be a Catholic.
* After her reception into the Catholic Church she began reporting intense experiences in prayer, including visions of Christ's Passion and encounters with various saints.
* Von Balthasar's words, convinced of the authenticity of her mysticism, became her spiritual director and in the end she would dictate some sixty books of spiritual and Scriptural commentary. Given her responsibilities as a mother and a practicing doctor, von Balthasar arranged, edited and published these texts, in the process, founding a publishing house.

\-----

* Pope John Paul II organized a Vatican symposium on her thought in 1985, almost twenty years after her death. Pope Benedict XVI described von Balthasar as one of the theologians he appreciates the most, remarking positively, ""It is unbelievable what this person has written and done.""
* In March 2018, together with Adrienne von Speyr, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur formally opened their cause towards canonisation.

Richmond Barthé's Quest to Sculpt God and Man,ThrowThisAway2k21,1624720464," \*Similar posts on  other SSA/LGBT+ Catholics can be found at [r/SSACatholics](https://np.reddit.com/r/SSACatholics/).\*

James Richmond Barthé (1901 - 1989) was an African American sculptor, best known for his work as part of the Harlem Renaissance which focused primarily on portraying black subjects, as well as the spirtuality of man. 

Barthé  was born to a creole family in Mississippi, raised by his mother following the premature death of his father when he was a few months old. Barthé took to drawing at a young age after his mother supplied him art supplies, and began painting at the age of six. Barthé would continue to develop his craft into his adolescence, although a typhoid attack at the age of 14 forced him to withdraw from school. 

Barthé would do various odd jobs, including as the houseboy for the wealthy Ponds family. Through his employment by the Ponds he met Lyle Saxon, an anti-segregration journalist that unsuccessfully tried to register Barthé at an art school in New Orleans. However, Barthé  would eventually get his break after selling an oil painting to a local Catholic church. The priest of the church, Rev. Harry Kane was able to raise the money to send Barthé  to the Art Institute of Chicago. 

It was at the institute that Barthé would be introduced to sculpting, the form he would gain his fame from. Barthé would leave for New York City, setting up a studio and Harlem, quickly establishing himself as among the most prominent artists in the budding African American art movement. Barthé work largely focused on the intersection between his devout Catholic faith, racial comentary, and the black male physique, influenced by Barthé largely closeted homosexuality. Barthé would tour Europe with a friend of Rev. Kane and live in Jamacia for some time during his career, gaining national and international acclaim. 

Barthé's most well known pieces were often religious in nature.  *John the Baptist* (1942), *Come Unto Me* (1945), *Head of Jesus* (1949), *Angry Christ* (1946), and *Resurrection* (1969) to name a few. Several of Barthé's works, like T*he Mother* (1935), *Mary* (1945), or the unfinished *Crucifixion* (1944)  are examples of empathsis of spirtuality and racial justice in his work. Barthé never married or had any long term relationships, only occasionally engaging in short-lived romantic relationships, although his subject matter often focusing on the male form did cause him to gain a fairly sizable audience of gay patrons. In a letter to African American writer Alain Locke, Barthé relayed his wish to have a ""friend and a lover"" to be with, although by all accounts Barthé remained celibate in his life. 

As the Church in modern times seeks to address the long standing grievances of black and SSA/LGBT+ Catholics and elevate them to their proper standing, Barthé is a prime example of a name that is unfortunately forgotten,  but should be a prime example for Catholics longing for justice, inclusion, and devotion to God in all of their activities.

How do you feel about Hungary's new law about LGBTQ+ community?,Florence1476,1624717805,"I don't know if there are any theoretical posts about it.

On the one hand, there is the freedom of speech, of people telling kids what they thinks it's correct and speak about an issue that's very present in today's world. Also, that way kids get to know that there are in fact LGBT people, and they should not be bullied for being different, and I think this last part is very important as a Catholic.

On the other hand, LGBT 'propaganda' without responsible parentes or tutors can be prejudicial for kids as they believe it's a moraly correct thing to do, and that it's not sinful. And that is against catholicism.

"I need resources (books, articles, videos, etc) on improving my Spiritual life. In need of help",PeterJames13,1624704343,"Most of my Catholic life (Including my former Protestant life), most of what I do is Apologetics  and more less about loving God, praying, doing His will, etc. This has damaged my spirituality and because of it, I focused less on prayer, became slothful all the time, became worried whenever a smart argument from an atheist or protestant go unanswered, and doing apologetics all the time. With little time or without ever having the time to love and follow God and to do His will.

This has been a long problem for me in most of my Christian life and I recognized that it is unhealthy and dangerous in thinking that Apologetics can save me. I am thankfully reminded by Matthew 7:22 where it says, ""Lord did we not work miracles in your name? Did we not cast out demons in your name?"". This applies to apologetics.

Questions regarding freedom of Religion from a Muslim,questions2christians,1624703528," Hi everyone,

I am using a throwaway account. While being a Muslim I listen to virtually every conference, lecture of Christians (including some Catholics) who criticize Islam from both a theological and political point of view. That's a weird hobby I know but I am a rather curious person and I really want to get to know the other side better.

However there is something that really puzzle me. I understand when Catholics criticize Islam for things that are in contradiction with Catholic teachings, I don't agree with them but yet I understand where they are coming from. But when Catholics criticize Islam on the law of apostasy (death penalty for someone who leave Islam in a Muslim state), I don't really get it.

I know apostates and heretics are not the same concepts, however I learned that the Catholic Church used to order the killing of heretics (those who publicly proclaimed heretical teachings and did not retract after some kind of grace period). It is not exactly the same as killing someone who leave Catholicism, the analogy with Islam isn't perfect however to an outsider it is kinda the same as both in Islam and Catholicism the ones (heretic or apostate) that don't go public are not to be executed by the State.

When I shared this issue with some practicing Catholics friends I got those objections :

1- 'The all inquisition thing is overblown by the mass media, anti-Christian establishment'. I agree and I think the inquisition did not killed as many as we might think however I was not pointing to the inquisition but rather to the general practice of 'persecuting' vocals heretics. I also don't believe that the Catholic Church actually ordered forced conversions, I have read parts of the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas and he clearly said non-Catholics were not to be forced into the Faith (while it was a different matter for those who already accepted the Faith).

2- 'The Church did not executed heretics it was actually the political powers (states, kingdoms, etc) who did it to maintain stability and peace in the land'. While technically true the Church still insisted on ordering the state to execute heretics (see the Fourth Council of the Lateran).

3- 'What the Church said on executing heretics was a pastoral matter not a doctrinal one, which means the Church was not bound to those former decisions on this matter and we got Dignitatis Humanae now anyway' while I understand that the Church moved on on this issue with Vatican II and that it wasn't a matter of faith where the Church would make no mistake, however I am like : How come centuries of theologians such as St Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Innocent III, Gregory XVI did not see freedom of religion as almost self-evident as Catholics do see it today ? Many Catholics today would see such limitation on public expression of religion not only as outdated but also immoral.

So here are my questions :

1- How come Catholics could have been so wrong for so long on that issue from Augustine to Gregory XVI ?

2- How can Catholics who criticize Islam morally on freedom of religion (specifically on the law of apostasy) still be coherent with the Church's theological justifications for persecuting heretics (see St Augustine use of Luke 14:23) ? I am not talking about Catholics who are saying 'Islam is outdated on this, the Church did move on' but folks who says that limiting freedom of religion and 'freedom of error' is purely evil.

3- How do you respond to those who say there is a contradiction between Vatican II and pre-Vatican II on freedom of religion ?

What bother me this most isn't the historical aspects of it, but rather the theological aspect of it, centuries of theologians finding justification to such practices both in scriptures and what is holy tradition to Catholics.

Catholics were not the only ones for that matter, Martin Luther and John Calvin were also in favour of persecuting heretics as were most of the theologians of their time (both Protestants and Catholics).

Really sorry for those questions, my intent is not to start a debate on Islam, but rather to understand Catholicism. I genuinely want to understand this issue.

**They started the party without even telling him?**

27 The servant told him, ""Your brother has come, and your father has killed the calf we had been fattening because he has got him back safe and sound.""

28 He was angry then and refused to go in, and his father came out and began to urge him to come in;

29 but he retorted to his father, ""All these years I have slaved for you and never once disobeyed any orders of yours, yet you never offered me so much as a kid for me to celebrate with my friends.

30 But, for this son of yours, when he comes back after swallowing up your property -- he and his loose women -- you kill the calf we had been fattening.""

Beauty - Goodness - Truth is the path to God that one of Catholicism's brilliant minds of the 20th Century laid out in his monumental work. Today I'd like to remember Hans Urs Von Balthazar who died on June 26th 1988. He is on the path to sainthood with his friend the mystic Adrienne von Speyer,TJB74,1624700633,"  

* He was very sad that Theology had become so dry, abstract and formulaic he would produce a monumental body of work to correct this.
* In this work of 15 volumes he gathered the scattered achievements of the European theological, philosophical and literary tradition around this fundamental insight of approaching God through Brauty, Truth and Goodness. 
* This monumental work, is often referred to as a trilogy which was named Herrlichkeit (The Glory of the Lord), Theodramatik (Theo-Drama), and Theologik (Theo-Logic). By the end of this series, he hoped that theology would become once again,  living, dynamic and glorious.  

&amp;#x200B;

* He left the Jesuits when he formed   a ""secular institute"".  with Adrienne Von Speyer called the Community of Saint John in 1945,  of consecrated laypeople established in 1945, with a mission to work for the sanctification of the world from within the world.
* However he did not leave the priesthood and five years later would be incardinated into the Diocese of Chur as a diocesan priest.
* .Von Speyer, a mother in her late thirties, a doctor and a prominent figure in Basel society, had converted to be a Catholic. 
* After her reception into the Catholic Church she began reporting intense experiences in prayer, including visions of Christ's Passion and encounters with various saints. 
* Von Balthasar's words, convinced of the authenticity of her mysticism, became her spiritual director and in the end she would dictate some sixty books of spiritual and Scriptural commentary.  Given her responsibilities as a mother and a practicing doctor, von Balthasar arranged, edited and published these texts, in the process, founding a publishing house. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Pope John Paul II organized a Vatican symposium on her thought in 1985, almost twenty years after her death.  Pope Benedict XVI described von Balthasar as one of the theologians he appreciates the most, remarking positively, ""It is unbelievable what this person has written and done."" 
* In March 2018, together with Adrienne von Speyr, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur formally opened their cause towards canonisation.

Nobody asked,roaming-buffalo,1624690832,"A certain atheism-focused group on this site seems to reach the r/popular list quite often, and based on the content they tend to post, this Sheen quote seems pertinent.

&gt;“Mockers; can you not see that they are defensive? Have you ever noticed how many of them are writing and talking and giving reasons why they do not believe in Christ’s Mystical Body? Nobody asked them for their reasons; nobody invited them to build their little house on the Rock; but they feel bound to tell you why they are not doing it. Nobody goes around telling people why they are not believers in a new Sun Cult or why ‘paint the barn week’ is a snare invented by a paint manufacturer. This is because people are not conscious of Sun Cults and barns. But all of a sudden, these people have become conscious that they do not have the faith, so they immediately proceed to justify their position. They never tell us what they believe, but what they do not believe. They never give a lecture on why they go to Rock Island, but they give profuse lectures on why they never go to the Rock.”

would my idea potentially offer a solution to the schism?,FactsMachiene,1624684058,"(this isnt a joke, i honestly believe what i am about to say makes sense but i am just a confused individual)

ok, so we all know the only way to solve this schism is for one of the sides to concede and admit the other is right. but obviously no one wants to do that. we can argue theologically all we want, but i cant find any clear cut evidence that proves orthodoxy over catholicism or vice versa.

i say a central authority judges the 2 churches as the leaders (frankie and barty) rap battle. perhaps some other higher ups could also. 

alternatively you could also make the 2 leaders have a full on debate, but thats boring. actually it could work but i wonder how a definitive agreement would work out.

i used rap as an example as i really like rap, (i also wrote a schism rap you can see it in my post history), but you could replace it with anything else (other than theology).

"I need someone who is pro-LGBT and Catholic to talk to. I left the church in my early teens in response to homophobia and was aggressively atheist for years. Lately, I've found myself feeling the urge to reconnect with my Catholic heritage, but I'm scared and ashamed.",levitatingloser,1624680961,"I want to start this off by saying I am not anti-Catholic, and I have not been anti-Christian for the past five years or so. This is both a request for help and a therapeutic attempt at getting this off of my chest to fellow baptized Catholics. I currently identify as an atheist, but have become increasingly more spiritual over the past few years (in my own unique way) and over the past couple of months have been questioning if I should reunite with Catholicism. 

I am a twenty-four-year-old lesbian that was born and raised Roman Catholic in the Southern United States. I realized that I was a lesbian when I was ten years old and came out at age eleven. The way I came out is by respectfully participating in the [annual Day of Silence](https://www.glaad.org/tags/day-silence). Coming from a small town, many people in my catechism class went to my school, and saw this happen. I respectfully engaged in basic communication (yes, no, why was I doing this, thank you, etc) via notebook. I was punished by teachers for not participating in class discussions for a single day (because they didn't ""agree with that"") and became an even bigger target for my already cruel peers. Around this time the Westboro Baptist Church was very big in the news for protesting LGBT people and the funerals of gay and trans people. I was just starting puberty, discovered I was VERY different from everyone else in a significant category of life, and that there were a large number of people who wanted me dead for it. I was viciously bullied at school and that carried over into my catechism classes. When I attempted to go to my teacher and a priest for help, they both essentially shrugged it off and said I was lying. I began refusing to go to catechism and managed to exhaust my parents into letting me drop it before I got confirmed into the church. I'm so lucky that other than a few years of ""are you sure"" my parents were accepting of the fact I'm gay. I don't know if I would be alive today if they hadn't, with all the social hatred I experienced and witnessed growing up. 

I can't tell you what exactly triggered my new feelings, but I've recently started to find comfort in little things like the sign of the cross when afraid or repeating the Lord's Prayer or Hail Mary in my mind. I find myself missing the community of belonging to a religion. The blind comfort of believing there was something larger than myself that loved me. But after the things I experienced, I came to the conclusion that God couldn't possibly be real if he would damn me to eternal suffering in the afterlife and persecution during my time on Earth solely based on which gender I wanted to marry someday. 

Part of me has begun to feel the urge to find a Catholic church near me and attend a Mass, just to see. But at the same time I'm absolutely terrified to step foot into a church again. After I stopped going to catechism my parents would still force me to go to Christmas Mass for a few years, and I'd have legitimate panic attacks over the fear that if anyone knew what I was, they'd hate me and want me out of their holy space. I'm starting to think I stopped believing in a God entirely out of pain. It helped me survive at the time. Now, I'm in a much better place, and I find myself experiencing a spiritual emptiness I never had before. 

I know that Pope Francis said he approves of gay civil unions, but was forced by the Vatican to retract that statement. Even though I didn't believe I was overjoyed when I heard of Pope Francis' opinion, and it was crushing to hear the news that the Vatican retracted that statement. I desire spiritual connection and community, but I am afraid. I've been physically and emotionally attacked by a very prejudiced church in the past, and I'm so scared of being attacked again. I don't want to have to be hypervigilant to avoid all references in life to me being gay to protect myself just for the sake of reexperiencing religious community. As was my mindset when I lost my faith, I would rather be alone than be around people who are against my existence. 

Is it safe for me to reengage with other Catholics? Are there places for people like me to go where I won't have to be afraid? I've been joking with my friends that these feelings can be chalked up to ""Catholic guilt"" but I really wish I felt safe to experiment with my faith. I know that not all Catholics are anti-LGBT, but enough of them are that I find myself questioning my safety should I be ""exposed"". I don't know what to do.",Catholicism

Adam's Soulless Father,rodwyer100,1624677356,"Dear Catholic Friends, I was wondering if you could pose a theologian's response to this question. There is no overwhelming evidence that the human species gradually evolved slowly from simpler species, ultimately to single cellular creatures. This would have been a continuous process, where in each step the parent would have been almost indistinguishable from their children.

Meanwhile the human soul is discrete and indivisible; there shouldn't be something like ""half a soul"". This presents an immediate absurd consequence to me; Adam's father would have had no soul. What I mean is that there must have been a step in the continuous process of evolution where a person was spontaneously granted a soul. This means this person would have been raised by a ""soulless"" person; furthermore biologically that person would have been almost indistinguishable from his child. 

Perhaps this is the step where you would disagree, but seemingly that human's brain patterns would have been indistinguishable from his son's, and behaviorally he would seem human.

[Free Friday] A ballad to tribute St. Maximilian Kolbe (OC),GregorianChant007,1624676054,"**THE LIFE AND DEATH OF 16670**

*\*Numbers pronounced 16-6-70 and 56-59*

&amp;#x200B;

His name was 16670,

That was his name – by those who killed him.

This life, this man of Polish blood,

Born with strength of heart and limb.

&amp;#x200B;

The man, as lad, was poor as dirt.

Fed by his family’s hand at loom.

Simply grown and simply taught,

Their home could rather be called their room.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet out of this simplicity,

The Mother of God had greater plans.

She appeared to the boy and offered him

Two crowns, one on either hand.

&amp;#x200B;

A crown of red, a crown of white,

Crowns of joy, yet death and pain.

He asked for both, because he knew:

Life is Christ, and death is gain.

&amp;#x200B;

He grew a wight and willful lad,

Dreaming to engage in strife.

In his parent’s plan, a businessman,

Yet he entered consecrated life.

&amp;#x200B;

He was called Father Kolbe to nobler men,

And the Mother of God to him was dear.

He fought for her cause, and gathered her troops,

Proclaiming her truths to all that hear.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He never stopped this glorious cause,

Though his name was thought with stain.

He didn’t fear the hostile sort,

For life is Christ, and death is gain.

&amp;#x200B;

His flesh became weak, his breathing strained,

Yet he pushed his knights to a greater zeal.

His flesh regained strength, to fight for her.

Their message gained ground, their shouts to peal.

&amp;#x200B;

It came that in the neighbouring lands

A movement rose among old and youth;

Their song was death, proclaimed as life,

And lies of power, proclaimed as truth.

&amp;#x200B;

And so it was, they rose to great heights,

Taking over German reign;

With troops of their own to push their cause,

And it seemed at the time that truth was slain.

&amp;#x200B;

But Kolbe and his zealous militant

Never backed down nor silenced their cry

For they knew that if given time,

Truth overcomes the boastful lie.

&amp;#x200B;

And so he was caught, and so it would seem

That truth became his earthly bane.

But even in Auschwitz he lived full of love,

For in life is Christ, in death is gain.

&amp;#x200B;

At last came the test, ten chosen to die.

A man, a father, cried in agony.

So Kolbe gave his life instead, an act of love,

And 5659 became 16670.

&amp;#x200B;

In his days of death, he was filled with joy

And even while starving, strength become less

He gathered with his comrades, singing praise

About Mary’s glorious and triumphant “Yes”.

&amp;#x200B;

His end was in a vile vial of death.

This they thought, was his final bane.

But Kolbe lives yet more than before,

For life is Christ, and death is gain.",Catholicism

I am not completely sure about my faith, or maybe I actually am, but the secular world is just so attractive, and I don’t want to miss out. I want to go back, at some point.

But I have also considered becoming a priest. My plan, at least officially and at the moment is to go into STEM, but I’m not really sure. Not anymore. I wanted to go into STEM because of the job prospects and because I have always been good at math and science. And I can’t really explain why I have thought about becoming a priest, besides that I really want to feel close to God and my faith, and that I wouldn’t mind celibacy and have thought that it might actually be better for me. Being honest, wanting to become a Catholic priest is kinda frowned upon here, maybe seen as unambitious and of course the stigma. I have not told my parents about it because particularly my father (who will probably sustain me for the rest of my time as a student) has very negative views about the church. Of course I need to start practicing my faith again first, but it feels so awkward to tell my parents that, as I literally haven’t been to mass on a regular Sunday in years.

I struggle greatly with intrusive thoughts awake or asleep. And don't know how to deal with them besides running from them. 

I find making my confessional hard because I'm not sure of some sins, lack discernment of some , and some I'm not sure how to number some

[Free Friday] A ballad on St. Maximilian Kolbe (OC),GregorianChant007,1624674281,"THE LIFE AND DEATH OF 16670

*Numbers pronounced 16-6-70 and 56-59

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
His name was 16670,

That was his name – by those who killed him.

This life, this man of Polish blood,

Born with strength of heart and limb.

-
 
The man, as lad, was poor as dirt.

Fed by his family’s hand at loom.

Simply grown and simply taught,

Their home could rather be called their room.

-
 
Yet out of this simplicity,

The Mother of God had greater plans.

She appeared to the boy and offered him

Two crowns, one on either hand.

-
 
A crown of red, a crown of white,

Crowns of joy, yet death and pain.

He asked for both, because he knew:

Life is Christ, and death is gain.

-
 
He grew a wight and willful lad,

Dreaming to engage in strife.

In his parent’s plan, a businessman,

Yet he entered consecrated life.

-
 
He was called Father Kolbe to nobler men,

And the Mother of God to him was dear.

He fought for her cause, and gathered her troops,

Proclaiming her truths to all that hear.

 -
 
He never stopped this glorious cause,

Though his name was thought with stain.

He didn’t fear the hostile sort,

For life is Christ, and death is gain.

-
 
His flesh became weak, his breathing strained,

Yet he pushed his knights to a greater zeal.

His flesh regained strength, to fight for her.

Their message gained ground, their shouts to peal.

-
 
It came that in the neighbouring lands

A movement rose among old and youth;

Their song was death, proclaimed as life,

And lies of power, proclaimed as truth.

-
 
And so it was, they rose to great heights,

Taking over German reign;

With troops of their own to push their cause,

And it seemed at the time that truth was slain.

-
 
But Kolbe and his zealous militant

Never backed down nor silenced their cry

For they knew that if given time,

Truth overcomes the boastful lie.

-
 
And so he was caught, and so it would seem

That truth became his earthly bane.

But even in Auschwitz he lived full of love,

For in life is Christ, in death is gain.

-
 
At last came the test, ten chosen to die.

A man, a father, cried in agony.

So Kolbe gave his life instead, an act of love,

And 5659 became 16670.

-
 
In his days of death, he was filled with joy

And even while starving, strength become less

He gathered with his comrades, singing praise

About Mary’s glorious and triumphant “Yes”.

-
 
His end was in a vile vial of death.

This they thought, was his final bane.

But Kolbe lives yet more than before,

For life is Christ, and death is gain.

Baptism help.,BlueRose86,1624671382,"I am a Catholic and want to baptise my daugter. My husband is happy for this.  He was baptised protestant but is now aethiest. 

Our problem stems from the fact that my family, as Catholic can be godparent but because his family are Protestant they can only be Christian whitnesses. This is causing a lot of upset for his family (even though husband and the person we asked to be whitness said they were ok with it.)

Is there anything a Godparent would say on the day that is different to the Christian whitness or do they make the same promises? The arguments I'm getting is that I am sidelining one side of the family in favour of the other when all I am trying to do is raise my child in my faith. 

I'm going to talk with my priest about this to see if there's anything can be done to make them feel better. But I'm honesty so upset that something as unifying as God's love is causing such arguments and thats it's become a ""them vs us"" instead of about my daughter joining God's family.

Christian Silence,Runaway_Poet,1624670865,"This is an interesting and very powerful statement from St. Ignatius that I found in his Epistle to the Ephesians:

&gt;It is better for a man to be silent and be [a Christian], than to talk and not to be one. It is good to teach, if he who speaks also acts. There is then one Teacher, who spoke and it was done; while even those things which He did in silence are worthy of the Father. He who possesses the word of Jesus, is truly able to hear even His very silence, that he may be perfect, and may both act as he speaks, and be recognized by his silence. There is nothing which is hid from God, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let us therefore do all things as those who have Him dwelling in us, that we may be His temples, and He may be in us as our God, which indeed He is, and will manifest Himself before our faces. Wherefore we justly love Him.

Ok, I don't understand how an infinitely merciful god could separate someone from his love for all eternity based off of, if we're lucky, 85 to 90 years on earth. Everything I've read about hell in Catholic theology talks about it being ""eternal"". You're telling me that one billion years after someone dies, they will still be being punished in hell for sins they probably can't even remember committing? You're telling me god doesn't give anyone a second chance after death? That seems extremely unforgiving.

There are definitely people who ""deserve"" to suffer in hell, at least for a little while, but I have a hard to believing that anyone deserves to be there forever.

And what about people who you couldn't reasonably expect to convert. Will an Aztec man who lived during the 1300's, and who's only experience with the Catholic church is violent conquistadors trying to colonize their home, be sentenced to hell for all eternity since he was technically aware of the Catholic church and rejected it?

Does everyone have a vocation?,lucanusor,1624669220,"I'm just wondering if everyone has a vocation.

What about people who die before feeling called to a particular vocation? I know God ""calls"" everyone in a sense, to do charity and good works and stuff, but I'm referring particularly to one of those states I mentioned, that is, a vocation. I hear people talk of non-consecrated singles as being ""intermediary"" because there isn't a life long commitment to a particular way of life, you are just waiting until you ""hear"" the call or something. But what if you never do?

I sort of feel this way. Never been in a relationship and not sure I really even desire to be in one. I'm sort of not good at being social and it would probably be really awkward, even more so than regular social interactions. And I can't see myself being a priest or religious either, for some of the same reasons but also because I feel that is a really big responsibility that I'm not up for.

An Update,OnceAndFutureMustang,1624668511,"I know I’ve been popping in and out here, discerning the faith - at one point in between, uncertain, and even dreading what my parents would say when I announced my intent to convert. 

Well, I can report that I’ve been attending Sunday Mass every week since the Ascension, and it has become the highlight of the week. I am also on track to begin RCIA in September! 

Only today did I realize *why* I’m here every week versus in some other random Church - *because I get to see Christ every week.* As the Eucharistic Lord. 

Last Sunday, the deacon had brought the Blessed Sacrament out of the tabernacle as the altar server I have gotten to know and I were talking. Everyone knelt immediately (for obvious reasons since a King - no, the King of Kings was coming through!) Yes it hurt on tile, but it was worth it for Him. 
 
No other church - save for the Orthodox perhaps - can boast that you get to see Jesus every week. Not as a vague concept of thought, but as a concrete reality.

Anyways, I’m not in fear but at peace wanting to join the Church. My mother notices I am “so relaxed” every Sunday afterwards, and I am beginning to smile more and appreciate my own family (even though they aren’t Catholic.) I cannot wait until Easter Vigil 2022 - I’m taking the slower path; I hope that is alright! 

I’d rather go through RCIA even if I know a lot of what’s going on and what’s taught already, since I want to avoid acting like I know everything. Scripture tells us the Blessed Virgin kept the things she had learnt from God, “pondering them in her heart.” (Lk.‬ ‭2:19‬) I wish to have the same attitude with RCIA.

"Guys, help",Finger-Gunz,1624668116,"I'm saying this on a throwaway(ish) account

I'm a 13 year old (if the age matters) Catholic who was recently confirmed (if this is also relevant,) and was really interested in what all the mortal sins are, specifically, I wanted to know if abortion is still a grave sin of a child was going to have a baby, and if homosexuality was a sin.

I saw the standard ones that I agree with (Prostitution, Pornography, Theft, etc.) But there were some that really took me off guard:

Divorce

Suicide

Homosexuality

Masturbation.

The divorce one took me off guard, because I felt as if the husband/wife were abusive, a divorce was the most practical solution, but it turns out that it was a mortal sin. I was really taken by surprise when I read this, I felt like people who are divorced (unless they are abusive) didn't deserve to suffer in the afterlife.

The suicide one took me off guard too, because the people who committed were already suffering to begin with, and making them suffer more just didn't sit right with me.

The homosexuality one shocked me as well, because I never really cared that much what one person does with another, as long as they were both consenting adults. But then I found out that it was a mortal sin, I felt a little bad. Keep in mind, I never knew most of these were mortal sins until now, because they didn't tell us some of these in my Religious Education classes, only the basic things like murder, adultery, and theft. And for the verses in the Bible that did talk about men sleeping with men, I thought they were all mistranslations. I also thought that gay people were just born that way, and didn't choose to be gay, and that the general scientific consensus was that you could not change your sexuality.

The most embarrassing one to talk about is the masturbation one. Like I said before, I didn't know most of these were sins, mortal ones to be exact, and until today, I masturbated everyday since I was 12, not knowing that I was hurting God in the process. I was almost on the verge of tears while I was praying to God, begging him in my head to not take me to the depths of Hell. I have been sinning for almost a full whole year now, not knowing that I could be sent to hell for what I was doing. I heard that doctors recommended it at a moderated amount, and that it was healthy and prevented things like prostate cancer. I also thought masturbation was an important part of growing up, as I am still going through puberty, and I have random erections and thoughts, which I felt was normal for 13 year old boys. There is also a thing called ""blue balls,"" which is when your testicles hurt and turn a shade of blue when you have been aroused for too long without ejaculating.

I am very torn on the masturbation issue especially, and I'm scared that I could go to Hell when I die.

I have not been baptized yet.

I was not raised religious, but it is still a homecoming. It’s a *re*version, if anything.

I’ve struggled as I’ve grown close to the Church, having not been formally initiated — I read James Martin, GK Chesterton, Flannery O’Connor, Hilaire Belloc, JRR Tolkien, Oscar Romero, St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, even Pope Benedict XVI’s book on Jesus, and my heart thrills to it, but I pull back — it feels like it isn’t mine. After all, I was not baptized Catholic. I was not baptized at all.

Today, I’ve come free of this. There is no particular reason — it came in a flash. The Catholic Church is the faith of my fathers. I put my faith in Jesus Christ as the savior of the earth, and I believe in one church, one, holy, catholic, and apostolic — I believe that is the Roman Catholic Church and the throne of St. Peter. There is no other way.

I have a long road ahead of me. I am not formally inducted into the Church. But if I die today, I will die a Roman Catholic, like thousands of generations before me.

[Megathread] Residential Schools in Canada and Discovery of Unmarked Gravesites,otiac1,1624662518,"In order to centralize discussion and ensure widest possible dissemination of pertinent information, a Megathread has been developed to address issues surrounding the Residential Schools in Canada. Salient information compiled from several sources (included below) is as follows: 


*  The location of unmarked graves near former Residential Schools in Canada, to include 215 in Kamloops and 751 in Saskatoon, has resulted in an upswing in attention paid to Residential Schools. These graves are the burial sites of many children who attended these schools. 


What were Residential Schools? 



*  The Residential School system was implemented by the Canadian government in the late 19th century to educate and convert Indigenous youth, assimilating them into Canadian society. They were operated as a partnership between the Canadian government (who provided funding) and Christian religious organizations (who staffed them). The Catholic Church staffed around 50-60% of Residential Schools; Protestant ecclesial communities staffed the rest. 



*  Conditions at Residential Schools were poor. They were underfunded and lacked clear directives from the government agencies which established and provided for them. Overcrowding, low quality of construction, and abuse by staff given widespread poor regard for Indigenous communities and culture was not uncommon. Limited resistance to infectious disease among the Indigenous population and poor sanitary conditions combined with periodic epidemics in the 19th and 20th centuries resulted in far higher rates of death at Residential Schools than in other Canadian institutions. 


*  The religious organizations which staffed them were poorly trained, poorly paid, and generally understaffed with tremendous turnover rates. Despite the poor conditions, many qualified individuals worked in the Residential School system, and dedicated themselves to improving the lives of those they served. Many of the Catholics who served in Residential Schools were members of religious Orders and were unpaid, or paid a tiny fraction of the amount of those at other institutions. There were also a small number of Indigenous community members who worked within the schools.


Why were grave sites unmarked?


*  Knowledge of the deaths at Residential Schools was not unknown among members of the communities they were built for nor the staffs who occupied them. There appears to be no evidence that unmarked graves are due to concealment attempts by Residential School authorities. Given the lack of resources (despite ostensible government funding, no appropriation appears to have been made by the government for burial expenses until the mid-20th century), especially during emergencies such as acute epidemics, there was little help to prepare and bury individual who died. Burials were conducted with minimal resources and graveyards were established informally. Such graveyards held not only students who died, but staff and settlers. Many of these graveyards appear *ad hoc* in nature, being poorly resourced originally, and it was not uncommon for them to have been abandoned following the closure of Residential Schools as what little infrastructure did exist to support them was removed. 


What has happened since then?


*  In 1991, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB) issued an apology and statement of regret concerning the pain and alienation suffered by many at Residential Schools. The Church in Canada has provided over $60m (CAD) in either direct payments or services in programs as part of the response to Residential Schools. 


*  Since the late 1990s, often with support from the religious organizations who originally ran the Schools, members of the Indigenous communities who attended Residential Schools have sought support and compensation for them time at Residential Schools. 


*  In 2005, the Canadian government established a compensation fund for former attendees of Residential Schools. Since then, approximately $4.8bn (CAD) has been provided by the Canadian government to former members of Residential Schools (both by the original fund and additional appropriations designated thereafter). As well, a number of former Residential Schools have been selected as national historic sites. 


*  In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI expressed his sorrow to Canada’s Assembly of First Nations over the abuse and neglect that occurred at Residential Schools run by the Catholic Church. Before Pope Benedict XVI, Pope John Paul II also expressed his sorrow at the suffering of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Pope Francis has done so as well, and has directed the Canadian bishops to take leadership of the Church’s response in Canada. Neither the Canadian bishops conference nor the Holy See was involved in running the Residential Schools. Those Catholic organizations who were responsible have also apologized and met all obligations stipulated by settlements reached as part of the reconciliation process in Canada.

How much validity should I give to dreams?,M16MoJo21,1624656759,"To preface, I'm on day three of the St. Joseph Novena. 

The last two nights I've had two, very vivid dreams, both relating to my prayer intentions. While I wouldn't exactly call them ""lucid"" per-say, I had a lot more clarity and was able to focus in on some things. As a sidenote, I very rarely, if ever, remember dreams upon waking up.

While the first dream reawakened some memories I hadn't thought about in years, and left me with some clear ideas to meditate on while bringing a sense of joy. The second was far more disturbing, and I'm not exactly sure what to parse from it.

I don't have a spiritual director to bounce these ideas off of, or go into greater detail with yet. I'm just wondering how common this is with this particular Novena. How much credence I should give to this, etc.",Catholicism

Confused about a very racy sex scene in a movie on the Vatican's Great Films list from 1995,Evergr33n333,1624656432,"**I ask that you please read my message in full before responding.**  **I apologize for the length,** but I have struggled with sexual problems so I think about these issues in depth.  The length is so my question is not misunderstand or written off as **""Catholics aren't prudes.  Stop being a prude.""**

In 1995, the Vatican released a list of important films  on the occasion of 100 years of cinema. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican%27s\_list\_of\_films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican%27s_list_of_films)   **I know the Catholic church is not as uptight about nudity as some may think.  I also am not (or at least I think I'm not).**  I know Michelangelo painted figures nude, and they were covered up, then later uncovered.  **I know the Catholic Church does not think the human body's nudity is inherently bad.**  I am also not really a prude.  I think pornography is bad, and I have struggled with viewing pornography and nude women online for many years, but recently overcame it.

One of the films on the list contains a sex scene between a man and his mistress. She is on top of him in bed thrusting, there is moaning, and you see her bare breasts.  I was a bit shocked by it.  I know breasts aren't inherently bad.  I could understand the activity taking place in the movie, but being depicted differently.  I don't understand how a man could not find this woman not arousing.  She is beautiful.  Some movies have sex scenes where the couple kiss each other and passionate fall into bed.  I could see that being OK.  But they go really far in this.  I can see how it's depicting that he isn't moral, having a mistress, and just cares about himself.  But they could have depicted the sex differently.

The movie is Schindler's List, and obviously all the other nudity in the movie is non-sexual and meant to depict people being stripped of everything and treated like nothing.  **I have no problem with using nudity to depict that serious message many sadly need reminding of.  It would be sick to find that nudity sexually arousing.**  I can understand in a way why the film is on the list because of it's powerful message, but isn't the Vatican saying it's OK to watch explicit sex scenes like this as long as it's part of an important story?

There is another film called Metropolis with a scene with a burlesque dancer.  She is wearing pastys on her nipples while she dances in an erotic, but strange fashion.  **I did not consider this overtly sexual.**  I think she is supposed to be a robot in a dystopian future, and the way it's depicted is meant to be really weird and funny, like it's weird that the men are supposed to like this weird robot dancer.  **It's pretty tame and I don't object to it.  I don't think the woman doing this was exploited.  I'm just stating this so people don't think I have a problem with nudity in art.**

I ask this question because I am often confused by what lust is.  I generally believe what the Catholic Church teaches, especially with the larger matters, but some things I'm uncertain of and feel confused about.  I try to understand but I cannot, and asking priests hasn't helped.  I feel like people are going to attack me for asking this question, or make fun of me.  I work around extremely attractive women who wear leggings, and I feel so confused about enjoying it.  As mentioned, I've overcome pornography recently.  So I think about these kinds of issues and what is allowed and not allowed.

I won't post it here, but obviously the Vatican says it's OK to view it at least in the context of the movie.  You can find it on Vimeo if you decide it's OK to view as a stand-alone scene.  I won't link or encourage anyone to if you don't feel it's right.

[Free Friday] What do you think about Mushishi?,CuriousChicano,1624652735,"I watched Mushishi a while ago and always wondered if it’s a good anime for Catholics? 

It is known as bedtime stories for adults because of its ethereal and episodic nature. Hardly any anime tropes in its two seasons, two double-length episodes &amp; a short film concluding the story in 2015. 

Synopsis: ""Mushi"": the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply ""being."" They are beyond the shackles of the words ""good"" and ""evil."" Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural world such as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows.

This is, however, just a vague definition of these entities that inhabit the vibrant world of Mushishi, as to even call them a form of life would be an oversimplification. Detailed information on Mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence.

So what are Mushi and why do they exist? This is the question that a ""Mushishi,"" Ginko, ponders constantly. Mushishi are those who research Mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life.

Ginko chases rumors of occurrences that could be tied to Mushi, all for the sake of finding an answer.

Let’s talk about Catholic schools,Reddituser2452,1624651980,"

Teachers were known to be stricter and harsher, meaner, sometimes even physically abusive. I don’t know how it is today, I assume things are a lot better but even 20 years ago when I was little I went to Catholic school for a few years and remember the staff being unpleasant to deal with. Not physically but definitely a lot “meaner” than when I was in public school. 

Not saying this didn’t happen in public schools many years ago but I think Catholic schools take/took this to a next level. 

So odd coming from a place of education focused around a religion that is supposed to champion thinks like forgiveness and kindness. 

With what is known about Catholic schools I must say that I truly believe that the Catholic staff that ran these indigenous schools in Canada were probably very abusive and evil.

[Free Friday] The nation-state of Israel is a mystical abomination,nessiewatcher4lyfe,1624651880,"&gt;Anybody who wants to damage this fortress and other fortresses we are establishing will have his head smashed against the boulders and walls \[...\] We say to \[the Palestinians\] from the heights of this mountain and from the perspective of thousands of years of history that they are like grasshoppers compared to us. - - Yitzhak Shamir, former Prime Minister of Israel

Ever since the recent attacks on Palestine which have conveniently passed into obscurity, I've been blessed (or tasked, perhaps) by God to read the stories of other such massacres and abominations which have been committed by the state of Israel upon the native Palestinians. I knew that still-waters run deep but I confess that I did not know how deep! ! !

The Israelis have consistently massacred the Palestinians ever since they usurped their homes and their land. They have brutalized them, tortured them, taken away their rights and what is the end result? That much we all know, because it is the end result of all sin: they have condemned themselves.  Sin violates the rights of others and it takes away the dignity of self. The nation-state of Israel, built as it is upon the bodies of dead Arabs, is an abomination upon the landscape.

The push for the colonization of Palestine by the various Zionists confederations around the world dates back to Moses Hess and his book [Rome and Jerusalem.](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rome_and_Jerusalem) Zionism is a nationalist movement and those who advocate for it greatly diminish the actual vocation of the Jewish people, which is primarily concerned with responding to God's Covenant in the spirit of Christ \[CCC 841\]. 

Zionism is instead concerned with forming a secular political identity, one which supercedes any religious feelings. If religious feelings are of any use it is to more firmly establish a sense of national unity, even at the expense of *the other*. In this way, Zionism is not unlike Nazism, and practically this can be seen in the violent actions perpetrated by both ideologies.

Ironically enough, the Zionists were not ashamed to work with the Nazi regime to accomplish their ends of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine. Hannah Arendt has mentioned that preceding World War II the Zionists encouraged an atmosphere of emigration, even telling Jews to *""Wear the Yellow-Star with Pride!""* 

Nazis, likewise, held no qualms about satisfying the Zionists' wishes by allowing for the illegal immigration of Jews to British Mandate Palestine. In the end, the British were humiliated by such actions, yet this only served as fuel for the fires of Nazi anti-semitism and it betrayed the Jews of Germany while satisfying the avarice of their Zionist compatriots.

Compare the Massacres at Lidice and Deir Yassin. The Nazis murdered the men, women, and children of Lidice in an extremely punitive act which revolts the conscience. Such violence is totally unacceptable and unjust; now, in Deir Yassin we see the same thing. The Israeli death squads indiscriminately killed defenseless men, women, and children, dumped their bodies into mass graves, all for the purposes of terrifying the neighboring populaces. Now, after all these years, Israeli development continues to shamefully build over the homes and graves of those they slaughtered.

On October 14, 1953, a punitive force led by Ariel Sharon attacked innocent men, women, children and even animals in the village of Qibya on the West Bank. Families were dynamited in their homes, a reoccurring theme in the slaughters perpetrated by the ""reparative"" Israeli forces. Another reoccurring theme: the denial of any wrongdoing by the Israeli government.

In Kafr Qasem, Israeli forces declared a curfew, unbeknownst to local farmers returning from their fields. The Israelis opened fire killing 49 of them including women and children. Following the massacre David Ben-Gurion declared that some people near the border had been ""injured."" The soldiers who were accussed of perpetrating the massacres received an increase in their salaries, vacation time, and national applause. Shadmi, one of the leading generals in the attack, was merely fined one *piastre* (two cents) for his role in the slaughter.

During the 1978 invasion of Lebanon, Israeli forces herded Lebanese and Palestinian refugees into camps, surrounded them, and for days subjected them to violence, raping women, executing men and boys indiscriminately, even killing children or dynamiting families that were trapped in their houses. Palestinian doctors were singled out, taken from the hospitals and executed in the streets. Hundreds were killed in Sabra and Shatila. All this occurred while Israeli soldiers perched atop an apartment building could clearly see the events which were occurring, yet did nothing to stop them. When Pope Saint John Paul II received news of these massacres, he said: ""With a soul filled with bitterness and deep pain, I have learned the news of the horrendous massacres committed in the Palestinian camps in Beirut. There are no words adequate to condemn such crimes, which revolt the human and Christian conscience.""

Indeed, they do, reading about these and more is really shocking. I always thought disliking the Israeli state was a kind of soft-anti-semitism, especially coming from Arabic peoples that I've met. Now I have a better understanding, I think. The Israeli state is truly an abomination of desolation. And positioned as it is, mystically within the Holy Land sacred to Jews, Christians, and Moslems alike, I see shades of the Apocalypse in its existence. In medieval times the Holy Land was considered by some writers to be the ""navel of the world,"" making it a kind of mystical center that all the nations were oriented towards. So then it makes sense that Israeli exists the way it does. It is both a facilitator of national sins as well as the byproduct of international sin itself. Think of how implicated in these massacres the United States is and how ultimately, in the end, that culpability has led us into repeated conflicts in the Middle East and also brought the painful tragedy of September 11th to our own soil.

Will there ever be peace in the Middle East? If there will, I think it will have to come from the source of all true peace and reconciliation: **The Sacred Heart of Jesus.** When the Immaculate Heart of Mary triumphs over that region and men surrender their hearts to the King and Center of all hearts, then there will be peace. No peace will come from Israeli rockets.",Catholicism

What did Thomas Aquinas see?,Boniface2021,1624648626,"Wikipedia says:

&gt;It is traditionally held that on one occasion, in 1273 at the Dominican convent of Naples in the chapel of [Saint Nicholas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas),[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#cite_note-64) after [Matins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matins), Thomas lingered and was seen by the [sacristan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacristan) Domenic of Caserta to be levitating in prayer with tears before an icon of the crucified Christ. Christ said to Thomas, ""You have written well of me, Thomas. What reward would you have for your labor?"" Thomas responded, ""Nothing but you, Lord.""[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#cite_note-FOOTNOTEde_ToccoLe_Brun-Gouanvic1996-65)[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy1912-66) After this exchange something happened, but Thomas never spoke of it or wrote it down.  
&gt;  
&gt;On 6 December 1273, another mystical experience took place. While he was celebrating Mass, he experienced an unusually long ecstasy.[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy1912-66) Because of what he saw, he abandoned his routine and refused to dictate to his *socius* [Reginald of Piperno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_of_Piperno). When Reginald begged him to get back to work, Thomas replied: ""**Reginald, I cannot, because all that I have written seems like straw to me""**[**\[66\]**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies19939-67) **(*****mihi videtur ut palea*****)**.[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#cite_note-68) As a result, the *Summa Theologica* would remain uncompleted.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMurray201327Ch._10-69) What exactly triggered Thomas's change in behavior is believed by Catholics to have been some kind of supernatural experience of God.[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#cite_note-SEP2-70) After taking to his bed, he did recover some strength[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHealy20037-71) but died three months later.

What could Thomas have seen that would make him disavow his life's work - the setting forth of Catholic doctrine and philosophy in exacting detail?

Note he had two experiences. The first one did not cause him to give up. Maybe he missed the message there, which is why God followed up?

I feel there is something very challenging here for Catholics to think about, given the monumental influence Aquinas had and continues to have.

"Isaiah 7:14 - I Don't Understand The ""Greater Fulfillment"" In Matthew",not_gizmoz,1624643641,"I've been mulling over this for a few days but the passage in Isaiah and Matthew's use of it don't seem to go together. To illustrate what I mean here is an example of passage in the OT that I think does clearly find it greater fulfillment in Jesus:

Hosea 11:1  
\&gt;  When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. 

Matthew 2:15  
\&gt;  where he \[Jesus\] stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” 

Now clearly Hosea is talking about Israel, not Jesus. Yet, Hosea's words do have a fulfillment in Jesus because just as God called his (rebellious and imperfect) ""son"" Israel out of Egypt, so to has he called out his (obedient and perfect) true son Jesus out of Egypt. You can clearly see this is a greater fulfillment.

But I can't seem to do this with Isaiah 7:14

Now there are some differing opinions out there but it seems like what Isaiah is ""truly"" saying in 7:14-16 is something to the effect of:

\&gt; Don't worry Ahaz! If contemporary woman who is at this time a virgin were to conceive normally, by the time her child would know right from wrong (2-3 years) these threats that you dread will be gone. Have some faith in your Lord!

There are some debates about who this child was (Isaiah's son, random child, child doesn't really exist, etc.) but regardless the 2 kings died afterwards and Judah was safe (for now) and Isaiah's prophecy reached it's ""lesser"" fulfillment.

 So now we reach Matthew 1:22-23:  
\&gt;  All this \[the birth of Jesus\] took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Behold, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call Him Immanuel” (which means, “God with us”)

This is hard for me because I don't see anything that ""connects"" the lesser fulfillment to this supposed ""greater fulfillment"".  Matthew use the of the prophecy seem to be at odds with what Isaiah meant originally.  For instance, Matthew takes ""the virgin will conceive"" to mean a literal virgin conceiving. But Isaiah seemed to mean it as some who *currently* a virgin and does not imply that the woman will be a virgin when they conceived (and of course in the ""lesser"" fulfillment this woman did not have to even be a virgin as the Hebrew allows for simply ""young woman""). Matthew also takes ""Immanuel"" to mean literally ""God \[is\] with us"", as in the incarnation, but Isaiah seemed to mean it as ""God is on our side"" 

I suppose, ignoring all of that above, my biggest problem with Matthew's use is that it seems to be taken horribly out of context. In Isaiah's oracle this Immanuel is a sign of deliverance of Judah from Israel and Syria within a few short years, yet our ""greater fulfillment"" ignores all of that and focus only on the fact that a child will be born. It just seems to me that Matthew was reading from an Isaiah scroll and read ""Behold the virgin will conceive..."" and thought ""That kind of sounds like Jesus"" and wrote it down as a fulfillment without reading the context.

I'm sorry if you can't understand what I wrote here, I'm quite terrible at articulating my thoughts.

Scrupulousness and the salvation of the soul.,DependentShirt8089,1624643417,"Hello all,

I’m very scrupulous and sometimes have a hard time truly knowing if I’ve sinned or not.  Even to that point there is something inside of me that says you did or didn’t and it’s a constant battle.  This is especially difficult since I have generally lived a life of sin prior to my revert.  I have resigned to commit to an honest confession at least once every 2 weeks sometimes once every week.  I am honest with my confessor in that I am scrupulous.  

Truly I am terrified of burning in hell and have been filled with the peace of Christ and ask just for his will to be done before mine.  I’m growing everyday though I’m not perfect.

My question pertains to my sins.  Since I sincerely battle with my sins do I always have to go at my earliest connivence?  Like I said I make a regular habit to go once every two weeks at the latest.  If I committed a mortal sin and intended to go to confession at the end of the week and died would I go to hell?  Or would my intent override that?  Or do I need to be calling my priest immediately to confess?",Catholicism

Catholicism isn't about going to the good place when you die. (The problem of Arbitrariness),Mlg_Rauwill,1624636938,"Hello my fellow Catholics,

So I've been reading the excatholic subreddit and really trying to take seriously what they are saying. Most of it is really just pot shots at over zealous Catholics, but I see the validity of some of their critiques. One such critique is why we worship God. A common theme I've been seeing is that people see good people outside of the faith, and if going to church is all about being a good person why should I go to church. Further more why should God get to judge the good? If God suddenly commanded murder to be good would it be good? Why should we obey the commandments of a tyrant who sends us to hell if we don't agree with him? These are the strongest arguments they have by my estimation.

One key theme is strung throughout these critiques and that is arbitrariness and power. They think God is a cosmic tyrant who decides what is good and what is bad and anyone who disagrees is sent to the bad place. The way I framed it would probably be an example of voluntarism, where the traditional claim would be God can only command the good vs the claim that is being made is that that which is good is good because God commands it. I think this is once again a problem with freedom or freedom in the modern sense. I see freedom in the modern sense as the ability to impose ones will on reality, to be able to choose. Which would be inline with voluntarism. Vs the traditional model of freedom which is the ability to choose well. To be free you must be able to not only choose but choose well or else you're just a slave to your passions. So to be free by this definition you must connect yourself to the infinite wellspring of the good, the true, and the beautiful which is God. To climb to the cosmic mountain towards the infinite.

So now I swing back to my original point which is that Catholicism isn't about avoiding the bad place or going the good place, because that sounds so arbitrary. Rather it's a journey, it's a journey to climb the cosmic mountain and reclaim the garden and by doing so to reunite heaven and earth. We aren't trying to escape this world so we can get to the next one, it's about a reunification of heaven and earth, a return to Eden. I see some people get so bogged down with the law of the church that they forget the intention of the law, which is reunification with God, to move toward the infinite in everything we do. So in that way it's also not teaching you how to be a good person, it's about teaching an ethos which then extends down to ethics. The ethics of the church is derived from the ethos that the law tries to capture. It's trying to help you move towards God, to move towards the true, the good, and the beautiful, not towards Plato's demiurge. 

This is just my first swing at this problem, but I feel it's probably the most important question that the church faces today. When Pontius Piolet scoffed at Christ and said, ""what is truth."" He's eluding to the problem of arbitrariness, and Christ's answer to that problem is the cross. The cross is the answer, which even in the modern age has been stripped of all of it's mystery and transcendence, but we need to recapture that mystery.",Catholicism
No such thing as good and evil?,ericx2x,1624636255,"I was watching a documentary on Ben Franklin yesterday.  


There was a moment the describes the beginnings of the enlightenment era. When Ben went to London he met someone who was named Bernard Mandavil. This person was known to say something like this:  


""There is no oral difference between good and evil. God couldn't possibly object to evil or pleasure because everything that comes to us comes from god because god created everything."" -Bernard Mandavill  


This actually interests me a little. Most of my life I have just determined things as good or evil but I realize living in this manner brings me no joy in life. Sometimes I feel like I am judging too much when only God can judge. But at the same time I like to classify things as evil because otherwise I would be a loose cannon, perhaps committing evil.  


I just find this to be very confusing. I can contradict my own thoughts on the subject, and the bible seems contradictory at time. Any fellow catholics have a perspective on this?

Orthodox-Catholic wedding,Fair-Interaction5486,1624635494,"
I’m rather unsure if this is the right sub to ask, but have any of you contracted a mixed catholic-orthodox wedding? My boyfriend and I want to get married in a years span. He’s from Russian and Orthodox and I’m from Italy and a Catholic. We’re both religious although I’m more involved in my church than he is with his. We’re also long distance as I live in Rome and he lives in Canada.

Now I will talk to my priest on Sunday but I was just wondering if anybody had any advice? From what I’ve gathered Orthodox Christians can’t marry with a Catholic ceremony if they want to stay in their community, while Catholics can asking permission to their Bishop.

The fact that he lives in Canada and I’ll move there will it complicate things when getting married in Italy?

Honoring my father and a repeated confession,Gjak_Illir,1624634322,"This has a strong trigger warning dealing with physical &amp; emotional abuse

To preface, I don't hate my dad and fully understand that the past is now the past and any past actions are now between him and God, now that my mom is safe away from him. I don't see, from my limited perspective, how he can be saved because he is the type who is never wrong, and I guarantee to this day he saw himself in the right. And there was also harm cause to me in his actions and not just in the trauma of seeing him physically abuse my mom and blaming him for the abuse, not to mention other things such as cops being called on Christmas day due to him abusing my mother to the point where she was not safe and living in domestic abuse shelters 

Biggest lingering impact to me was in my constant fear and constant doubts in myself because the physical abuse aspect has an easy qualifier, but the emotional abuse aspect does not (I don't know how to describe it - he fully believed that he was in the right and noble, something that was clear looking in from the outside). I have caught myself mirroring him and have had strong emotional responses, but im more terrified about the times that I have not caught myself

I forgive him because thats not my place and at the same time I dont know how I can comply with the fifth commandment. I want to do what is correct and want my kids to know their grandfather (obviously through the safety of me being there, not that I believe he would try to harm them) but how can I? I don't hate him but I don't love him, I am on minimal speaking terms and never think to call him unless he repeatedly tries to call me and i eventually decide to answer.

I have two questions:

1) Can anyone who has read the book vouch for it?

2) I read that the pope, in his will, asked his personal secretary to burn these diaries but he did not do so because he saw merit in publishing it. Is this ethical?

I’ve woken every morning feeling incredibly sick, I’m never at peace for more than a few minutes, and I just feel like garbage. 

I keep seeing an image in my head of a scene from The Passion when Judas was hiding under the bridge and Jesus was knocked off the bridge and hanging by His chains before being pulled up, and remembering the fear Judas had in his face knowing he betrayed Jesus.

I’m planning to go to confession tomorrow since it’s the earliest I can go, but it just feels so far away, and I can feel that evil temptation clawing at me to not go. I will go, it’s just going to be a fight right up until I’m in the box.

Having a hard time with hell,DependentShirt8089,1624625417,"I definitely believe hell is real, but can’t fathom how anyone deserves to go there.  I know we don’t deserve salvation to begin with, but it seems most humans are wholly ignorant of God. I hardly know anyone that actually believes in God.  So how could these people fathom choosing heaven or hell?  And even those that have some understanding of Jesus it’s more of a culture thing.  (We go to church on Sunday thing).  Like they don’t really believe.  

I keep hearing it said that we freely choose hell.  But how could anyone choose something they don’t really understand.  I mean even a formerly trained Christian cannot fully understand heaven or hell.  So much mystery that surrounds both.  

A quarter of the world is under some kind totalitarian control that limits religious freedom, while the rest are consumed by a false religion or completely blinded by some kind of consumerism (chasing worldly things, because that’s what you do as a developed society).

I don’t claim to know who’s in heaven or hell, but even a guy like Hitler or Stalin (both atheist) couldn’t have known the true gravity on their souls of the evil they committed.  I’m not defending them, rather saying maybe they would’ve acted differently if God’s presents was evident to them.  Maybe the Lord did and they still denied him.

Best true proof of God:,Redtiger91,1624620354,"First I would like to quote the Quran (not exact, from memory): ""Worship the creator: Allah, and not the creation: sun, moon, and man"" also ""Those who argue againts God, are wasting their time with true believers"". Something like that. 

Blaise Pascal on the God and nature: I wonder at the boldness with which these persons undertake to speak of God, in addressing their words to the irreligious. Their first chapter is to prove Divinity by the works of nature. I should not be astonished at their undertaking if they addressed their argument to the faithful, for it is certain that those who have a lively faith in their heart see at once that all that exists is none other than the work of the God whom they adore. But for those in whom this light is extinguished, and in whom we desire to revive it, men destitute of faith and grace who, seeking with all their light whatever they see in nature to lead them to this knowledge, find only clouds and darkness,—to tell them they need only look at the smallest things which surround them in order to see God unveiled, to give them as the sole proof of this great and important subject, the course of the moon and planets, and to say that with such an argument we have accomplished the proof; is to give them ground for belief that the proofs of our Religion are very feeble. Indeed I see by reason and experience that nothing is more fitted to excite contempt.

Not after this fashion speaks the Scripture, which knows better than we the things of God. It says, on the contrary, that God is a God who hides himself, and that since nature became corrupt, he has left men in a blindness from which they can only escape by Jesus Christ, and except through him we are cut off from all communication with God. Nemo novit Patrem, nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare.

[92]

This is what Scripture indicates when it says in so many places that those who seek God find him. It is not of a light like the sun at noonday that they thus speak. No one says that those who seek the sun at noonday, or water in the sea shall find them, and thus it follows that the evidence for God is not of that kind. Therefore it says to us elsewhere: Vere tu es Deus absconditus.

The metaphysical proofs of God are so apart from man’s reason, and so complicated that they are but little striking, and if they are of use to any, it is only during the moment that the demonstration is before them, but an hour afterwards they fear they have been mistaken.

Quod curiositate cognoverint, superbia amiserunt.

Such is the outcome of the knowledge of God gained without Jesus Christ, for this is to communicate without a mediator with the God whom they have known without a mediator.

Instead of which those who have known God by a mediator know their own wretchedness.

Jesus Christ is the goal of all, and the centre to which all tends. Who knows him knows the reason of all things.

Those who go astray only do so from failing to see one of these two things. It is then possible to know God without knowing our wretchedness, and to know our wretchedness without knowing God; but we cannot know Jesus Christ without knowing at the same time God and our wretchedness.

Therefore I do not here undertake to prove by natural reasons either the existence of God or the Trinity, or the immortality of the soul, nor anything of that sort, not only because I do not feel myself strong enough to find in nature proofs to convince hardened atheists, but also, because this knowledge without Jesus Christ is useless and barren. Though a man should be persuaded that the proportions of numbers are immaterial truths, eternal, and dependent on a first truth in whom they subsist, and who is called God, I should not consider him far advanced towards his salvation.

[93]

The God of Christians is not a God who is simply the author of mathematical truths, or of the order of the elements, as is the god of the heathen and of Epicureans. Nor is he merely a God who providentially disposes the life and fortunes of men, to crown his worshippers with length of happy years. Such was the portion of the Jews. But the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of Christians, is a God of love and consolation, a God who fills the souls and hearts of his own, a God who makes them feel their inward wretchedness, and his infinite mercy, who unites himself to their inmost spirit, filling it with humility and joy, with confidence and love, rendering them incapable of any end other than himself.",Catholicism

My soul doth magnify the Lord....,artoriuslacomus,1624611546,"My head keeps going back to that verse from Mary and I can't help thinking of it as an example of what we should all be doing. Not as a woman pregnant with a child of such powerful Spirit that it couldn't be contained anyway but in our own lesser ways. 

In giving a few dollars to a homeless man we exude a spirit of charity, a virtue of God which (I think) qualifies as magnifying the Lord. And by ""magnifying the Lord"" I mean that quite literally. I'm talking about glorifying God, which is our destiny according to Isaiah 43:7. We do that by willfully exuding his risen Spirit into our fallen, material realm so that the Spirit of God becomes thick and heavy upon the face of the earth, as in the days before the fall. 

Essentially, we glorify God (magnify the Lord) by channeling his Spirit, his virtues into our fallen realm so that through us, Gods Spirit eventually overwhelms the material realm, as in the days of Eden, before the fall of man.

I have heard two different responses to this, and I'm interested to hear Catholic opinions on this:  
1. People say that everything bad that happens is for God to fulfill a greater good in the end. The problem I have with this approach is: I don't understand how NOT curing the sick can somehow lead to a greater good in the end. Also, when we decide to cure the sick, are we working against God's original plan? What if we attempt to cure a person, but we accidentally give him the wrong drug and he dies. Does that mean that God meant for the person to die?  
2. People say that God is in a permanent conflict with the Devil and other evil forces. They indirectly say that God is not all-powerful (because then he ofc would just win the war straight away).

I just went through a very difficult period. The biggest thing that got me through it was God. (A Testimony),GlowQueen140,1624596326,"This is dedicated to everyone who is going through a particular trial right now, feeling dejected, hurt, perhaps even alone. Maybe you feel like God isn't listening?

I get it.

My fiancé (N) and I spent about a year planning to reunite for good and get married. The situation in my country, Covid-wise, was getting a lot better, and we were pretty much opened internally with little restrictions, etc. N and I decided that he would come in early July and we would do a small ceremony and start our lives together. In anticipation of this, N quit his job and cut short his lease. It also needs to be said that N was only in his current country of residence for work. He would not be able to stay there for long if he did not have a job. N was also originally from a South Asian country that is struggling heavily to keep Covid in control (no prizes for guessing which one).

So when we received news two Mondays ago that N's entry into my country would be suspended/deferred until further notice, it was undoubtedly devastating. The problem was a sudden surge in Covid cases in the country which led to fast restrictions being placed on businesses and activities. My biggest concern was his living situation because his lease would end soon, my second biggest concern was that they would force him to go back to his country of origin because his work visa would expire. If he had to go back to his country of origin, it was likely that I would never see him for a very long time because my country has banned all travelers from that country. Aside from this, I would also need to reschedule all our wedding plans within 2-3 weeks (although this was admittedly a smaller concern compared to everything else.)

I honestly felt very upset, and while I tried to keep my faith in the Lord, it was really difficult. N was also very upset because he didn't even know how to start to fix this. We had some very tense conversations which did hurt and didn't help our relationship.

Nevertheless, I hung onto my trust that God would show us the path we were meant to talk on, even if not this one. I started praying the rosary most nights, pleading to our Mother for her intercession. I did the rosary with my fiancé over video call too. This was something I never did with just him before. It was very difficult to admit, but I told the Lord that if truly, N was not meant to come in now, then to guide us on what to do.

I also posted in the prayer thread over two weeks. And I'm sure that some of you in the group were praying for me over a casual glimpse of our request. For that, I thank you.

Last Sunday, the Gospel really spoke to me. I always find it serendipitous that when I actually go looking for answers, the Word of God has never failed to present me with some. Last week's Gospel was about Jesus and his disciples in the storm. His disciples really thought they were at the brink of death, and they were fretting about. Which would be totally understandable if anyone was in that situation. And yet, Jesus calmed the storm at the last minute and everyone was okay. He even had the time to do a rebuke about the disciples not having enough faith.

I knew then that God was listening to my pleas. I also knew that He would not let us drown. I even heard Jesus' rebuke as Him rebuking *me* for not having enough faith.

True enough, through the help of my local MP (member of parliament) and a LOT of prayers from family and friends, just yesterday, I received the good news that N's entry had been reinstated due to a slowing of the cases, as well as an increase in vaccination rates. I thanked everyone that needed to be thanked but I am grateful most of all to the Lord because this experience was the thump on the head I needed to remind myself that the Lord has a plan for us. And we have to follow *that plan* and not our own. And even if our own plans go askew, the Lord will guide us through the tunnel till the end.

Don't feel alone in your trials because the Lord is always by your side. I don't consider myself a particularly wonderful Catholic because I constantly struggle with my faith and everything else that comes with it. But sometimes, stuff like this happens, and I'm reminded why we need so much to continue praying and seeking out God's will for us.

I hope everyone has a wonderful Friday and I keep this community in my prayers.",Catholicism

So if they’re making you feel unwelcome in the faith to the point where you want to leave, they’re achieving their intended objective. They want a tiny small-c church made up of people just like them.

Nothing I get out of Catholicism has been presaged by the sadistic radtrad vibe of the largely negative online Catholic forums I’ve encountered. They’re about driving people away from the Church, not bringing them in.

My Conversion Story.,exz20042,1624593396,"So, this has been done a lot in this sub. Where do I start. I was a baptized Catholic as a baby. 2 years ago, I fell off my faith. I just thought, ""what if there is no God at all"". Though, I was 15 and wasn't really a great Catholic back then (I didn't believe in the real presence of the Eucharist, etc). During this Atheist phase, I would watch youtubers like Darkmatter2525, Holy Koolaid, CosmicSkeptic, etc and became pretty anti-religion like I thought it was entirely evil. As time passed I toned my Anti-Theism down a little because I found out how toxic that was. Then I came across this video by a channel called Jubilee called 'Can Satanists and Major Religions See Eye to Eye?' https://youtu.be/auPYOsBejK4. The Satanists in the videos are Atheists and talked the same way that typical Atheists do and had pretty bad arguments on the Bible. I thought to myself, ""Am I close to being a Satanist?"" Even though I didn't believe in the devil, something felt wrong and I could feel it inside. So I distanced myself even more from being and Anti-Theist Atheist. During this time I went from Atheist, to Agnostic, to Deist. I even had this desire to be in a religion, so I tried to join Unitarian Universalism at one point because they accept non believers and had these liberal stances but then I changed my mind because I didn't see the point. But I was still holding on my spiritual life, I remembered back at the Atheists and those Satanists, and the Gnostics (yeah I looked at Gnosticism) interpreting the Bible in their own ways. I wanted to check out how Catholics interpret the Bible. So I started off watching Bishop Barron, and Father Mike, looked into this sub and found Catholicism convincing (tho accepting certain doctrines was hard to do). It's been 3 months since I reverted and I feel like I grew. Thank you God for leading me to the truth and may I grow in faith even more.",Catholicism

I thought we were inclined to some sort of temptation because of our imperfections, and what really mattered is if we chose those temptations or not.

Etiquette at St. Mark's Basilica in Venice - Sunday Vespers and Mass,thirsty_lil_monad,1624570198,"Hi,  


I'll be fortunate enough to be in Venice and have the ability to attend Sunday Vespers and Mass at St. Mark's Basilica. I don't speak a lick of Italian, and I am not a practicing Catholic.  


I don't actually know what Vespers is/are, and I have only been to a Catholic Mass one time in my life and I was very young. I would love attend, but I would like to show proper respect.  


Questions:  
1. Should I arrive for only Vespers or only Mass? If I attend, should I attend both, or is it permissible to attend one and not the other? I am concerned about time and catching a flight (obviously I wouldn't stand up in the middle and leave, but I may only be able to attend the listed Vespers time).  
2. What should I do generally to show respect?   


Thank you so much!",Catholicism

What Medicine can I take and aborted fetal cells,TheSoulWanderer11,1624565554,"Scrupulosity disclaimer / warning 




Hi everyone, there’s something that’s been causing me a lot of stress lately. I’ve been going through the process to start accutane. I have had bad hormonal acne that natural treatment seems to solve for the past 6 or 7 years. It has effected me a long time and after doing my reading I am preparing to start accutane knowing potential side effects. There’s a few problems I’m worried about. 

I was hoping any of you guys would be able to share similar experience or advice. These past few months I have discovered just how widespread the use of aborted fetal cell testing in various over the counter and prescription medicines is. These include regular products like ibuprofen which I believe has been tested on fetal cell line HEK 239. I question the morality of using such drugs at all much less without grave circumstance, but I believe the top 20 drugs in the us fall under this category too. 

The extent to which testing is done is another huge factor. Whether or not the drugs have been used on cell lines, or whether the cells are an intrinsic part of the research and manufacturing process is something that could change for every drug (as far as I know given I am not a pharmaceutical expert). 

I do not want to offend God or descrate the cells of murdered infants. There’s the cell line, the medicine, if there was testing, the extent of testing etc. to consider with all of this. And this becomes a minefield from oral to topical medications. I do not know if fetal cells have beeen used in accutane or when i can stop researching if I am to start this medicine.

What scares me is how will I know if I can ever use a certain medication when it becomes necessary? Even children of God for life does not seem to have a database or way to verify every medicine. I do not wsnt to As you can tell I have a history of scrupulosity and ocd. I do not want to offend God.",Catholicism

Why was the ESV-CE given an imprimatur despite all its protestant bias if protestant bias is the reason we can't read protestant bibles?,gratiaplenadominus,1624559801,"Don't get me wrong, it's my favorite translation.

Obviously the deuterocanon is a huge deal, but setting that aside for a second, if I have a protestant bible + ""apocrypha"", I feel like the consensus will still be I should read a catholic bible. Again, I love the ESV. But it's a thoroughly protestant translation. At this point we have to admit that reading protestant bibles (with the deuterocanon) is just as good as a catholic bible because our catholic bibles have been entirely translated by protestants and given the catholic stamp of approval.

As a convert tho, I'm super grateful. I would feel so guilty reading the ESV without permission. I'm just confused. My other favorite translation is the NASB, but that feels prohibited from where we're standing, despite having no further bias than the ESV or NRSV.",Catholicism

Why doesn't our Lord seem to talk about His role as the Word (Logos) of God very much outside of a few sparse verses?,TexanLoneStar,1624556653,"For example let's take a look at what Saints John and Paul have to say when talking about the Logos:

John 1:1-3, 14

&gt; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made [...] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.

1 John 1:1-2

&gt; That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life— the life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made manifest to us…


Hebrews 1:1-3

&gt; Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power.

Colossians 1:15-17

&gt;The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together

1 Corinthians 8:6

&gt;yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.

Among these 5 verses we see some major themes being that the Word of God:

1. Is pre-existant, and thus God
2. That the Word is made manifest as flesh
3. All things were made *through* Him, things visible and invisible
4. Creation not only was made through Him, but remains *upheld* by Him.

Our Lord does not not seem to talk about his roles as the Word very often, I've noticed. And I've always wondered why that is since I think Logos theology is one of the more fascinating parts of the Christianity.

You get some sparse verses like John 6:38 where our Lord acknowledges He was sent from heaven; a very weird verse to people who claim that Jesus was simply a wise rabbi, or a mere prophet made like Adam. He touches on his assumption of flesh, and implied pre-existance:

&gt;For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.

Again, later, He touches on His pre-existance in John 17:5 and glory He shared with the Father

&gt;And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.

Yet I've always been confused why our Lord never seems to mention points 3 and 4.

I realize that not everything was recorded by the Apostles (John 21:25) and that the testimonies were written so that we ""may believe"" (John 20:31, 1 John 5:13); not have a total compendium of everything Christ taught.

However, the idea that God the Father created all things through Him (and even further: upheld by Him) seems like it would have been a major major teaching and I've always been curious as to why Christ never addresses this.

Any thoughts as to why not? Or am I missing verses where He Himself gives heavy implications of points 3 and 4?",Catholicism
I don't like going to confession,BeautifulGenius10,1624554944,"I hate when I go to confession and confess my sins and TBH I don't even think I've sinned that much. Who knows, maybe the priests hearing my confessions are/were worse sinners than me.

But I don't like when the priests act like they're holier than me and look at me as if they think I've sinned so much when I honestly don't even think I've sinned much. Several times I only went to confession because St. Padre Pio recommended going to confession every week, and I confessed that I was selfish because I didn't know what else to confess, then the priest started criticizing during his homily that it's bad to confess the same stuff week after week, and a couple of priests said during their homilies something along the lines of pretending to be nice but being very selfish inside after I confessed to them that I was ""selfish"" because I didn't have much else to confess (although honestly I think everyone is selfish. Even saints struggled with selfish instincts. I tend to distrust people who call other people selfish as if they think they themselves are so selfless).

Would you consider waiting till marriage in intrinsic part of your core values personally and how does that come into play in a relationship?,polly-1,1624553385,"I'm in a relatively new relationship with my boyfriend and have recently started talking about past experiences with sex and sexual boundaries. I'm finding it difficult to accept his past without knowing if he repented from his past actions with relation to sex and intimacy. How important do you think it is that both partners attribute the same value to sex and marriage?

Personally I want to wait till marriage. I believe that sex and other sexual activities are to be had within marriage and I want to make sure that I have these intimate moments with my husband. My boyfriend is also waiting till marriage but has done some stuff in his past that he says he regrets but I'm unsure if he has such a strong belief in waiting to do any other intimate activities till marriage. We have discussed our boundaries and he understands that I hold strong to my principles and what I want so we have agreed on waiting. But I am concerned that if for a moment while we're together I fall close to temptation, he will not stop if he doesn't hold the same principles I do. Obviously I always want to hold strong to my beliefs but I'm conscious that I'm human and can also fall into temptation. So I do my best to avoid this.

I'm scared that this can cause trouble in our relationship. I want to continue talking about this with my boyfriend but do you think it is possible to have a strong relationship if we don't both attribute the same amount of value to sex and marriage?

It's obvious I'm typing this and asking opinions here because I want consolation as I'm scared this can be a breaking point in our relationship. But I'd like to hear what others' experiences are and what is best to do in such a situation from others' experiences.

My journey towards rekindling my relationship with Christianity helped me evaluate my life and even others particularly TheraminTrees who made video on his journey from Christianity to Atheism which stood out to me...,Environmental-Cut344,1624550488,"First of all, I'm Filipino so even if I can write, speak, and understand English I'm still struggling so please forgive me if I can't fully process my thoughts. I remember, I think this was just last month, really starting to be enthralled again by Catholicism through first having this yearning or thirst for philosophy and truth especially when I was watching a lot of let's say modern philosophy that draws on secularist humanistic themes and sometimes even nihilism as its core like even science-focused channels like Kurzgesagt which I used to watch back in those days. So when I started revisiting Christianity again which first started when I started being annoyed at the double standards of feminism (3rd wave feminism to be exact) as I was a very huge kpop fan at the time and the kpop community is pretty progressive in general especially Westerners and I remember really getting angry at the fact that many kpop stans celebrate hashtags like #AllMenAreTrash which many claim as a joke but are also the first to be triggered when jokes are targeted towards their gender. So this was the 1st red pill moment for me. Also at this time, I was an agnostic or not really sure if God exists so I have this subjective view of the world because I only see God as this higher being not something more profound like on the topics of existence, truth, and all these Classical Theists stuff which I was introduced down in the line. Coupled that with my same-sex attraction made it hard for me to connect to God.  


At the time I was not aware of liberals and conservatives but I remember watching SJW-owned and Anti-feminist compilations so gradually from there I came across Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro and all these other guys. Jordan Peterson, in particular, was the waygate to Christianity and at this time I was still feeling sour whenever Christianity is mentioned and I blame that on this pervasive watered-down Christianity which now I would say is the result of Protestantism. Keep in mind I was baptized a Catholic and I even went to a Catholic school so I was taught about the sacraments and Jesus and Paul however it's only through exploring Christianity here on YouTube that helps me on my journey to rediscovering Christianity.   


This first started with Protestant Apologetics, one that comes to mind is ""Whaddo You Meme"" and sometimes mixed there with conservative politics like with Abbie Beth Stuckey. But even after watching videos from these people, I'm still left feeling hollow and nihilistic because I always have this underlying fear that when eternity comes and I get to be in heaven that it would just be boring and I would be in this complete state of trance, without any will or intellect. That's how I view heaven a while back. I also remember watching some of these protestant YouTubers who are clearly anti-Catholic like Polite Leader for example and I clearly remember feeling conflicted, lost, and alienated of my identity as Catholic so doubts and fear naturally came from it.   


At this time I still have an incomplete, shallow understanding of Christianity. Sure I was amazed by videos explaining the Bible by BibleProject and even Whaddoyoumeme on Christianity but the deeper existential questions are still at the back of my head and I knew now that if I have stayed in this protestant worldview of Christianity then my faith would easily crumble as ""sola scriptura"" is flawed on its own and ""sola fide"" for it relies on the faculty of faith alone and not complemented by reason.   


I also remember thinking ""Wow where are the Catholic YouTubers?"" because Christian Apologetics are mostly coming from Protestant sects at least from the ones I'm watching. And just one day I came across I believe Brian Holdsworth which was my first gateway to Catholicism and from there on I have watched videos from Pints with Aquinas, Taylor Marshall, Ascension Presents, Jonathan Pageau (he's an Orthodox but he's the one that really helped me see Biblical stories in a different light, much more mystical and poetic; ""a living myth"" indeed as I have heard from Peterson I think), Thomistic Institute, Counsel of Trent (an amazing channel which helped me a lot this last month), Fr. Mark Goring, Timothy Gordon, and to some extent Jimmy Akin for the mysteries. Oddly enough I have only heard Bishop Baron in some response videos or some of these people so I find it interesting that he is one of the OG's of Catholic teaching here on YouTube.   


And when I got introduced to Classical Theism and Thomas Aquinas my worldview began to change and I felt peace for the first time and it just clicked. My fear of this previous perception of heaven went away because for the first time I realized that we were made by God to be partakers of His divine will and have a personal connection with him for He loves us very much; that we're not mere automata or robots, that we have a choice: good or bad and whatever we choose will have consequences which means that we must always strive for goodness.   


This also changed how I view heaven and hell as I see both ends as either the final end from which our immortal soul will go. I also remember just this recently tearing up from all of these realizations on the story of Jesus Christ, God's ultimate self-sacrifice and love for us, humans. I started appreciating Catholic teachings and the intellectual tradition even more and now I'm not as conflicted with bridging my faith with scientific truths.   


This made me realized how blessed I am to continually know God through His One, Holy, Universal, Apostolic Church and also TheraminTree's journey in which he says one line that really stood out to me. And what he said basically said is ""I could do a better job than Yahweh!"" when reading, evaluating, and commenting on the dark parts of the Bible. Honestly when I first heard that I felt chills down my spine because it's a testament/warning of our capacity to fall into our pride as it not only leads to our downfall but also blinds us from ever seeking God.",Catholicism
Five Quotes to Bring you Closer to Saint John the Baptist,JourneymanGM,1624549862,,Catholicism
Are Catholic Traditionalists Fighting the Wrong Battle?,pointed_star,1624549318,"Look I'm biased. I come from one of the oldest Catholic families in my country but I'm proudly a post-Vatican II cradle. I look at some of the posts on this sub from conservative/traditionalist Catholics who seem to express vitriol toward the Church's current liturgical practices, social teachings and even it's magisterium. It often comes across like infighting between people who need not be opposed to each other. It's what the Holy Father described as *""safeguarding the ashes of the past""*. Our parish church was built by my great grandparents and our family has for generations worshipped in the very same pews ever since (my mom was baptised, communicated, confirmed, married and will likely have her requiem in the same church building). Of course I see:
- The beautiful bell which is now only rung on Easter Saturday (instead of daily for the Angelus - parents generation or even on a Sunday before Mass as it was when I was younger) [Especially when the Azaan belts out from the many mosques all over the city]
- The ambo which is no longer used. 
-The awkwardness of the Presiders Chair in front of the tabernacle, so that his back faces the Eucharist.
- The well carved altar rails which are now no longer used to receive communion. 
*And there is a real sadness to all this*. 

**But my family has taught me that the Church is not a 
 a container for preserved objects but instead like roots to be drawn on for future growth. I see that tangibly when I consider the faith that my forebears left for me.** 

I was recently DM'd by someone thinking about converting to Catholicism and tried to counsel him as to current teaching/articles of faith etc. *I did not suggest he approach RCIA because he seemed so very conflicted, rather I suggested he enquire about the next Alpha course in his diocese*. [I thought he needed to build faith before he could build Catholic faith]. In fact I said *at least 8 times, over a three day exchange of text, that the Catholic Church wasn't for him* ""The Pope is a mere man"". ""Apostolic Succession is a historical myth"". ""The Church has been guilty of a great many crimes over the years so It cannot claim to not err"". ""The Church should have no say in what consenting adults do"" etc. etc. 

When I tried to probe to get a better understanding of just why this man felt like he did, I saw that he was very much a product of current times, part of the ""progressive left"" in secular politics who have imbibed the neo-Marxist rhetoric they are being fed through the mainstream media and at schools and universities who are pushing a crazy social justice agenda. 

TL, DR: There is a war on religion, which has been amplified since Obama. Our mission to evangelise will need us to speak into a society which increasingly wants to make God in it's own image. In fighting between traditionalists and progressives in the Church damages our ability to respond to the great commission. Traditionalists need to better pick their battles.",Catholicism

I had committed mortal sins, I did very inappropriate things as a child, and I was in the know. I knew they were bad but I still didn’t stop. I hadn’t been to confession since i was really little, and i knew i was in a state of mortal sin. But i didn’t tell my parents “hey, i shouldn’t receive Eucharist.” i was much too anxious.

Years past and i thought all my mortal sin was forgiven, since i wrongly believed it could be forgiven when Baptismal vows were renewed. Now, having scrupulosity, i remember the “no Eucharist” rule.

TLM questions,Araedya,1624548080,"So I attended the TLM for the first time over the weekend and found it a bit confusing to follow. I figure that’s probably pretty normal in the beginning but I’d like to be better prepared for next time. I was given the red missal booklet when I first attended but it was a lot to read and understand during the actual mass and also doesn’t have the actual readings for the day (I decided to order a copy separately so I could read it at home and get myself better acquainted). In the meantime, I downloaded the FSSP imass app since it seems to cover everything (except when to sit/stand/kneel) and also has daily mass videos so you can follow along and get a better feel for what’s going on. However, I feel a bit uncomfortable using my phone during mass to follow along. I am a bit reluctant to spend the money for an actual missal as they seem rather expensive (and on backorder) and I’m not sure exactly what I’m getting for the price – does it have the daily readings as well as the general structure/responses of the mass? Is this a one-time buy? Also I’ve noticed that while trying to follow along with the videos on imass that there is a lot skipped and/or just different from their missal and not sure what to make of it. There were plenty of people that were only using the red booklet during mass – do people generally do the readings at home before they come?
 
TLDR: Looking for advice on the best way to learn and get comfortable with the TLM without necessarily spending $70+ on a missal. Thanks!",Catholicism

God's Hiddenness,ZealousidealCreme770,1624537571,"Hello Everyone,

I have a quick question. I have been listening to some debates lately from Atheist and Christians lately and typically I can get over many of the Atheist objections to the existence of God. However, one of them typically sticks a little bit more than others.

I listened to a debate in which the question was ""Why Doesn't God Make Himself Known"" in which the Atheist stated if God did exist why wouldn't he show up to not just every generation and to every individual in a way that they could not deny his existence. 

My initial thought would be that this would take away the theological virtue of faith and that faith is sometimes more intimate in relationship rather just straight up ""knowing"". My second thought would be that this would almost take away Man's Free Will in that they wouldn't do certain things because they know God is watching over them and could be seen as a tyrant rather than a loving father who respects the wishes of our actions.

Any Thoughts on how to address this question?

Seeking easy basic “what is Catholicism” resources for my Christian husband,qsunnyd,1624526492,"Hi folks, wondering if you all can recommend some very basic nuts-and-bolts resources to help a non-Catholic understand the basics of the faith.

Wondering if there’s anything rather short and very basic that can be recommended that explains how Catholicism differs from Protestantism and the key tenants.

Is it justifiable to make your children believe in the modern/commercialized Santa Claus?,ConfusedChurchKid,1624517945,"I've read very mixed opinions regarding this. Please note that I'm not talking about the real St. Nicholas, but about the mythical version of him.

The current Catechism defines a lie as ""speaking a falsehood with the intention to deceive."" If the parents' intention is to make their children believe the falsehood that Santa Claus ""literally climbs down chimneys, rides a sleigh with flying reindeers, etc,"" then is this technically a form of deception, and therefore a sin (albeit venial)?

Some people seem to say it isn't a sin, because they say it serves to discipline their children and to let them enjoy their imaginations. However, the writings of Augustine and Aquinas also tell us that all forms of lying cannot be justified, since the end can never justify the means.

So while there is nothing wrong with teaching values to our children and disciplining them through fairy tales, isn't it still morally wrong to deceive them through lying?

I can truthfully say that I have never properly prepared a confession and there have been mortal sins that I was truly sorry for that I completely forgot to confess almost like a never ending cycle. One from childhood which was a pretty bad one but it was completely in the back of my mind, never confessed, until I suddenly remembered it while talking to a priest about superstitions and the occult rampant in my culture 

I also don’t feel comfortable with the act of confession itself and understand that priests hear very bad sins, but that doesn’t change the fact that I don’t feel comfortable speaking mine (which leads me to a separate question - can I speak in general sometimes instead of the actual specifics?)

Things have just escalated to the point where neither of us can ever do right to the other and it’s almost constant disagreement with everything. Neither of us is happy in the marriage, and we both see the other as wrong

We come to an agreement where we will behave a certain way to each other and it goes out the window, this shows me that intent is there but it doesn’t come to fruition 

We’re both wrong and it’s clear as day to me, but I believe that it may be nefarious because of some going ons - the fact that problems are just escalating despite neither of us wanting it to, and we’re both hitting flags for emotional abuse on the other, neither of us are happy in the marriage, and some crazy stuff happens like the time when my spouse engaged in self harm, blaming me, and had to be put on a hold. She also is adamant of an unexplainable thing happening in the house involving one of our children getting pushed off the couch and I do believe her

We are both being petty and I can only speak for myself but it does appear that this also applies to my spouse - I see clearly that I’m being petty and I find it difficult to stop. I also have been saying things with an intent that’s seen in a completely different way and misunderstood. Happened today where she saw a comment I made in a certain way, got very angry with me, and I communicated exactly what I meant and understood that it came off wrong to her but I don’t even know how it could have come off wrong even now

Both of us are seeing therapists with the marriage as a focus, and apparently there’s nothing really obviously flagged from a psychological level apparently (other than possibly my adhd).

I don’t understand what mechanism this could have apart from cult indoctrination.

Lemme put it this way, why not teach children the faith if they have a genuine interest to learn. Apart from telling them about their immortal soul, the nature of god etc etc. what’s point? What if the child just doesn’t believe you? I can’t see me ever forcing down my faith on my kid past the age of reason. I don’t think it’s very good to psychologically brainwash a child into Catholicism rather than intellectually persuade and genuine belief on one’s own discernment.

I can speak from an experienced cradle Catholic perspective, Catholic parenting is absolutely worthless. When I was being raised in the faith as my parents perceived it (which was in error, yet another flaw in this practice) everything was taken as a given and without intellectual discernment and heavy punishments for thinking for yourself especially when criticizing or questioning the faith.

The minute I ran into atheistic skeptics I left the faith. I’m just coming back now not from my upbringing but because of intellectual inquiry.

Patronal name-saints—a question,monjilton,1624498867,"So, I’ve been in the Church since 2019 and devotion to the saints was one of the primary reasons why I crossed the Tiber, figuratively speaking. That said, my RCIA class never directed us to take the name of a saint for Confirmation, so I feel kind of robbed of that opportunity of bonding with a saint through that vital sacrament, you know? Not being able to choose a saint at Confirmation has left me with seemingly one other option, my namesake. 

I know I can *really* choose any saint, or rather allow that saint to choose me, at anytime, but I wanted this to be a decision that was out of my control for once; I’m in control of pretty much everything else. Which leads me to building a devotion to a saint I couldn’t subjectively choose on my own, my name-saint. Anyway, my given name is Jonathan, but there aren’t any ‘St. Jonathans’ that I know of. There’s King David’s friend, but I’m not sure if he’s considered a saint, per se. Instead, there’s St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist as the two primary models. 

How do I decide between the two? Do I just pray to both of them and then let them have this western-esque shoot out over who’s going to be my patron? (I don’t really think any saint in heaven is fighting over me, truthfully lol). I’m just wondering and would appreciate any answers to my (hopefully) light-hearted jesting/question.

Questions on 1 Samuel 26-28,simon_the_detective,1624492315,"I'm reading through 1 Samuel and I'm really amazed at what I'm seeing.

In 1 Sam 26, we see the second time David has spared the life of Saul.  Saul seems repentant for wanting to kill David and makes a second vow that he would never harm David.  Then, in 1 Sam 27, David is still concerned for his life and flees to live under the patronage (and apparent fealty, referring to himself as a servant in v5) to King Achish, a Philistine.  While with King Achish, David and his men raid neighboring kingdoms and peoples, killing all the people, but taking away all the booty.  It also appears that David lies to King Achish in v10 about what Kingdoms are being raided.  I believe that David tells Achish that he's raiding Israelites and Kenites (who we see were protected by Saul when he raids the  Amalekites in 1 Sam 15), but the actual parties being raided were others.

Then, in the next chapter, it appears he consents to go to war with the Philistines against the Israelites and only fails to go to war when the Philistine Lords object to his presence.

This all seems out of character for David, to serve a Philistine King, to raid and kill all the people when not explicitly commanded by God or a Prophet to do so, to lie to his patron King Achish about it and to be willing to make war against the Israelites.

Any commentaries available on 1 Samuel that might clear this up for me?  I suspect there's something I'm missing here.",Catholicism

Who Killed Goliath? - Can we trust the Bible?,Joshy2004194II,1624490121,"Greetings, everyone.

I have a question:

According to  2 Samuel 21:19, Goliath was killed by Elhanan. Yet, in 1 samuel 17:50-51, it says that it was David. Nevertheless, most point to Elhanan killing the brother of Goliath, as it is described in 1 Chronicles 20:5. So, case solved? Maybe...

So, there is an ACTUAL contradiction here in the Bible. I've searched all over the place, in both Catholic and Protestant sources, in the old Hebrew Bible, amongst scholars, and they all come down to the same conclusion: 1 Chronicles solves the issue. The issue was a copyists' fault.

But then, if the Biblical authors have made a mistake, how can we be so sure that there aren't other ""contradictions"" in the Bible? I understand words like ""brother"" and ""cousin"" can be used differently. I know hyperbole and exaggeration exists. That generalization is possible. But, when dealing with something as basic as ""who killed Goliath?"", it makes me wonder if the Bible was inspired in the first place.

If I could get some clarification as to why we still believe the Bible is inerrant and perfect, without ""contradictions"", and the WORD of God, when we have a factual error, I would be much obliged.

Seeing that we don't have the original manuscripts, and the ones we do have this contradiction, how can we find a solution to this issue?

Thank you for your time.

Summary of some of the important things I learned about leisure from Josef Pieper's book.,rememberuhavetodie,1624486646,"Hello, I was skimming through ""Leisure: The Basis of Culture"" and there were some good things that I wanted to share.

His definition was: **Leisure** is a condition of the soul that allows reality to present itself. 

I skimmed through and put a list together, because his words can be hard to process. 

**Non-activity** is an inner absence of preoccupation. It is the ability to let go of the work day/week. 

**Stillness** is being quiet, but ready to listen. It is attentive silence. 

**Openness** is a man that does not intervene. I made it into an analogy, the truth or your family, friends, strangers etc. are like a seed and you are the soil. The open man is receptive by allowing them into the depths of your heart. You give the seed time to crack open and put forth its roots into your soil. It is important to maintain (pull weeds/vices) and water (Sacraments) the soil in preparation for that root. 

**Celebrating Spirit** is an inner joyfulness that is celebrating the good received. All creation, everything that is (truth), was deemed good by God. The highest ranking good is God and therefore the highest from of celebration is worship. 

**Refreshment** is the replenishment of a good after an evil (twisted good or exhausted good) is sacrificed. This is fulfilled at the Sacrifice of the Mass. ""My sacrifice is a humble, contrite heart."" It is important to cultivate sorrow for your sins as well as trust is His unfathomable mercy.

**Wonder** is in a sense a removal of our connection to this world. A freedom that allows our minds to transcend to a higher existence. It is a state of not-knowing and unceasingly knocking on the door of Wisdom. Wisdom is not ""possessed"" it is lovingly sought after, which builds up our hope. Contemplating our unseen God is the most satisfying since He is unfathomable. 

***Pride*** gets in the way of our leisure. It is talkative and never really tries to listen (it just waits its turn to talk again). It intervenes; it is always correcting and never letting himself be corrected. It is blind to its own sin and thus doesn't go to confession. It asserts that it knows, it doesn't seek because it is so sure that he knows, thus closing the door to Wisdom.",Catholicism

Alternatives to Courage for LGBT+/SSA Catholics,ThrowThisAway2k21,1624483208,"In this subreddit, and in this month in particular, I've noticed quite a few people asking about why Catholic institutions or LGBT+/SSA people don't use Courage International. On the face of it it's a fair question. Courage is officially sanctioned by Church authorities, is in line with Church teaching, and has well established infrastructure.

Now, I'm not saying that Courage has never done any good or has never helped anyone, and experiences depend from local chapter to local chapter. But it's undeniable that Courage, and the approach many Catholics have towards the LGBT+/SSA community, is one that has limited appeal. The most obvious short coming is persistent allegations that Courage promoted/continues to promote ex-gay theology and reparative therapy, and they have been linked to people like Richard Fitzgibbons and Joseph Nicolosi that do promote such thinking. Additionally, their 12-step program is, as you could guess, more than a little suggestive that an uncontrollable, non-changing sexual orientation can be treated the same way as a chronic disease like alcoholism.

And that leads me to the main thrust of this post, the alternatives that people here seem to not know about. These organizations are led by and made for LGBT+/SSA Christians who wish to adhere to the traditional sexual ethic of the Church. They are often led by young people, many in their twenties and thirties, and appeal to young people.

[Revoice](https://revoice.us/) is an Evangelical/interdenominational organization that hosts conferences and talks about issues facing ""sexual minorities"" (SSA/LGBT+) within Christianity, centered in the sexual ethics and teachings of the Church on obedience, human dignity, and salvation. Many Catholics have spoken at these conferences, such as Ron Belgau, who spoke at the World Meeting of Families in 2015, and Grant Hartley, a former Baptist whose work has been published in America Magazine and has a podcast for celibate SSA/LGBT+ Christians, [Life on Side B](https://lifeonsideb.com/).

Another organization that I've learned about more recently is [Eden Invitation](https://www.edeninvitation.com/). Founded by two Catholic women, Eden Invitation is focuses on building up grass-roots organizations across the country that creates an evangelization that promotes belonging within the Church and elevating the stories and voices of SSA/LGBT+ people. They offer talks, book clubs, and retreats. The organization has gained increasing recognition and media coverage, including [winning a competition](https://aleteia.org/2020/10/09/new-movement-seeks-to-serve-an-overlooked-catholic-group/) from the OSV Institute for Catholic entrepreneurs.

But, as I stated in the title, I don't know if the success and potential these organizations have will matter to a lot of people. And that's because, as the language I've used in this post hints at, these organizations allow for people to use identifiers, pronouns, and identities that make them feel more dignified, happy, and healthy. I can't help but see this as a very silly obstacle that stops very needed dialogue. When people identify as LGBT+, wear articles or accessories that make them feel sane, or don't exactly conform to modern gender roles, that doesn't mean their having sex or disagree with the teachings of the Church.",Catholicism

Question about specific instance of homosexuality,5minusone,1624479182,"I understand and accept the Church's teaching on homosexuality. But I'm curious about this one case in my family; I think it's a bit of a gray area. From my understanding, the Church teaches that homosexuality is wrong because it takes certain aspects of a relationship (Marriage) that are designed for sex, and abuses them for personal pleasure.

However, these two people in my family do have same-sex attraction and do love each other, but I wouldn't say so in a sexual manner. They've never done anything close to sexualizing their relationship. They've never even held hands, kissed, referred to each other as ""married"" or anything like that, they don't talk about it much either; they even go out of their way to enter at separate times at parties. (Also, they're some of the most faithful Catholics I know; one of them even considered becoming a Franciscan for a bit.) It would kind of just look as though they're just two people who live together.

Would this still be considered sinful, since there's little sexual aspect of it? Kinda curious. Thanks, and God bless.",Catholicism

How Has Life Changed for You After Becoming Devout?,DeadpanSpider23,1624476256,"For those of you who lived most of your life without much regard (if any at all) for Catholicism, how has your life changed after becoming (for a lack of a better word) devout?

You see, I was raised pretty modern. My family went to church sometimes but we never made religion a priority. I grew up listening to secular music, playing bad video games, watching sinful movies and shows, and thinking it was all normal and nothing was wrong with it. I smoked a few times and drank a little bit, and I always imagined myself being a womanizer once I got older. 

But I found out that none of that was me. I only did that because society told me to, and deep down inside I was still the shy, honest person I always was.

Thoughts on the Douay-Rheims-Challoner (DRC) Bible translation?,pearlsnvodka,1624472209,"Hello friends,

I’m a very liberal/progressive Catholic having just returned to the Church a few months ago, and I suddenly like the most “hardcore traditionalist” English Catholic Bible translation in existence.

Months prior to returning to the Church after more than a decade, I had started doing a read through of the Bible from cover to cover which actually didn’t take that long. The friend that encouraged me to “give Christianity another shot” got me started with some of the more Protestant translations, four of which now have Catholic “versions” (in order of personal preference: ESV, RSV, NLT, NRSV). So I read those. I’ve never been a huge fan of the NAB (or NABRE) so I switched between these four translations throughout my read through.

I was never really interested in the more antiquarian translations but eventually curiosity got the best of me and I ordered a copy of the DRC. At first I kind of skimmed through a few pages and thought “this is pretty, but way too outdated for a progressive Catholic with severe ADHD like me”. I also had in the back of my mind the knowledge that the DRC is no longer the official English translation used by the Church so it felt like putting in the extra work wasn’t worth my time. So I put the Bible away and left it there for a while.

Then one night I was hanging out by my bookshelves looking for something that grabbed my attention and I decided to crack open the DRC again. This time, it really spoke to me. I noticed that some verses were almost totally different than in the more modern translations—not just because of modern language structures, but because of the different source material (the DRC is a translation of the Vulgate). I also realized that the antiquated language made me slow down and really understand each sentence. This approach was further enhanced by every verse being its own line; the DRC is not formatted in paragraphs. It makes every verse super meaningful; there’s no filler.

Because of this formatting, the DRC is a behemoth and even the “pocket” version is barely portable. I also got a rather small, portable version of just the DRC NT and Psalms that comes with me everywhere now. The NT of the DRC is especially beautiful to read. There are times when I can hardly put it down.

I’m curious to know what others’ thoughts are on the DRC. I know “DRC onlyism” is a thing and I’d find it particularly interesting to hear from that camp. On the other hand, if you’re not a fan of this translation, what are your reasons? Is it because of the source material, the flowery language, or something else?",Catholicism

This is the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church in the town of Longtianzhen, Fuqing, Fuzhou, China. It was established by Spanish Dominican Missionaries in 1896, the church was rebuilt in year 2000 to replace the old crumbling and dilapidated building that no longer serves the Parish community adequately. The new church has a capacity of 2,000. The church also rings its bell to signal the passing of each hour(except for late at night or early in the morning, of course). Compare this Baroque and Neo-classical inspired Catholic church built in year 2000 in China, which incorporates many features from the old church, to the new modern Catholic churches in the West, I personally prefer the former. Which one do you like better? Tell me in the comments.

The local Catholics have tried their very best(as best as they can, remember, this is Catholic church in a rural town in southern China, so please don't be too harsh and judgmental) at building a beautiful and worthy Temple for God almighty and making the church as awe-inspiring as they could, with a great deal of attention to the details, for example, there are reliefs of 10 angels play various musical instruments flanking the Immaculate Heart of Mary on the ceiling of the church; crosses on almost every window frame in the church(the parish couldn't afford stained glass windows); countless Corinthian column capitals lining the sides of the nave; floor made of different colored stones featuring simple floral designs, etc. Please upvote and tell me in the comments if you want to see more pictures of this church.

The local Catholics did not only wish to make their church beautiful, but also very practical, to demonstrate this, I will describe to you the layout of the first floor of the church: The first floor of the church is mostly a parking lot for the parishioners' vehicles(electric bikes and electric scooters), other than that, the first floor of the church also contains: A Lady Chapel(A devotional chapel dedicated to Our Lady); an office/meeting room; a guest lounge; the living quarters for the Sacristan and his wife; 2 sets of washrooms; living space for half a dozen elderlies; a large classroom, and a stage. Because the church is by the side of one of the main streets of the town, the street front of the church has been rented out to individuals for commercial use, to provide the parish with additional revenues, but worry not, for the actual church is on the second floor--completely isolated and separated from the 4 store fronts below, completely safe from any possible noises or any disruption from the stores below, as area immediately above the stores is an empty space with lampposts and beautiful stone flooring, we call it ""the church square"", but its really a very big balcony. There are two passages on either side connecting it to the back of the church, this together with the square creates adequate space for the processions that occurs at the church every so often and for the procession on Palm Sunday when the priest knocks on the door three times before processing inside with the congregation. It is actually not that empty as there are 2 additional shrines/chapels located on either side of the square, one dedicated to St. Peter, the other to St. Paul. There are also many potted plants on the square.

Here's a link to a video of the Altar boys, the interim deacon, and the priest in procession at the end of a Post-conciliar equivalent of Solemn Mass: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1q4ZxvTcII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1q4ZxvTcII)

The Archbishop of Fuzhou, Peter Lin Jia-shan, the REAL Archbishop of Fuzhou appointed by Holy Father in Rome, was recently recognized by the Chinese government, hence the Archdiocese was once again unifies under a single true Bishop, no longer broken between the Underground and the Aboveground Catholics, or at least in technicality.

The Church in China is still constantly pressured and harassed by the communists, please pray for the Holy Church in China and the conversion of China, so the works of all those missionaries--those who once came to China to save the souls of the Chinese-- that their works, their life-long goal, may be complete.

Anyone here successfully quit cigarettes?,Dependent-Summer2043,1624467994,"This may seem a little off topic, but this is something I'm really struggling with. I came back to the church about February, and I've been trying to rid myself of all of my bad habits...earlier this year, I was committing several mortal sins daily (although I didn't quite understand the concept of mortal sin back then because I gave up on religion after my dad died when I was barely a teenager). Ive stopped masturbating, smoking weed, drinking, purged my house of all occult books, got rid of my really bad music, etc. I still sin quite a bit, but I'm trying to be better every day. I've noticed such a difference in my behavior, but I feel like Ive hit a wall.

One of these walls is quitting smoking. I've been a pack a day smoker for about 15 years now. I've attempted to quit 3 times unsuccessfully (the longest period quit was about 2 months). I know this is straining the relationship with God I've been trying to build because it's so bad for me, and addiction just takes over. It leaves me feeling guilty, especially because I feel like I'm not psychologically ready to give it up. I'm in counseling for anxiety and depression(theyre also an addiction place so we do talk about my cigarette issues I'm just not in drug counseling or anything), and cigarettes have been a cover for a lot of issues. When I quit and lose that crutch, feelings come out and it gets painful. The rest was so easy to quit compared to this...I didn't realize how much resentment Ive buried and didnt fully let go of.

Does anyone have any tips on things I can do (prayers, etc) to help me come to terms with needing to kick this habit? The mixed emotions have had me slacking on developing a consistent prayer life, and its felt like a chore, which it didn't at first, and I hate feeling this way. Sometimes, it makes me start to direct that resentment at God, which I don't want to do at all, then theres more feelings I feel bad about even having. I dont even mean to or want to, but I see it happening, and I need to stop.

I was planning a day trip to this huge shrine (its dedicated to our lady of sorrows) within a week or so to see if that helps get me out of my head and reconnect. I was hoping that and a confession (they offer it daily there) would do me some good.

Has anyone else went through this or something similar (even if its a different vice)? How did you begin to get over it?",Catholicism

Choosing Between Church and My Family?,AceGymRat,1624467448,"So Sundays are The Lords day as far as I see it, so I tend to relax and not do any type of work on Sundays. Usually I would go to church but more recently I haven't due to the fact that my parents decide Sunday is the day to go out and do stuff, have family day. This is where I have a problem. The church services at the church I go to are all morning services, and happen to fall into the time that we are usually heading to the beach or to a park. Even the earliest mass time, 07:30, would have me get out at 08:15 and by that time we would already be halfway to the beach.

My family, especially my mom, know that I am a believer of Christ once again after a decade of straying away. They know that I go to church every Sunday and the only thing that would stop me from going is if I was so sick I couldn't make the 10 minute drive. But they continue to schedule family day the same time I am supposed to be attending mass. 

For that reason I haven't been to church in a month, and I keep putting off confession in which I haven't confessed in a decade. Does anyone else have this issue? I know I could just watch the live stream but going to church also gives me 45 minutes of peace (I have younger siblings) and my time with The Lord.",Catholicism

Do you think there will be a religious revival in the West?,theotokosprayforus,1624452353,"I've been thinking about how new age is becoming really popular where I am, and that militant atheism is not as popular as it used to be. Before I came to Christ, I was a self-proclaimed radical marxist feminist. I suffered so much in my life and this ideology seemed to provide an answer for me... you suffer because you are a woman (and a minority on top of that)! Men are the evil ones! But as I dove deeper into this ideology, I became more filled with hatred and anger. I thought I was so enlightened because I had PTSD and it caused me to seriously sit with myself and reflect on this world and on my life, and I thought about how many people don't do that and they just idle themselves with pleasure and distractions instead of thinking about the big questions. 

Well praise be to God, when I was at the end of myself, when I hit rock bottom, I turned to God. I saw that I could not rescue myself from my own suffering, that these ideologies were cold and empty... The Lord truly truly truly rescued me. 

So now I was thinking that perhaps the next generation will also experience something similar. This is probably the first generation in the west where most children are born into non-religious households. In the previous generations, everyone at least got married in church (even if they weren't necessarily devout, getting married at church was just part of tradition), and people would go to church at least during Christmas and Easter. Now here in Canada (at least where I live), couples usually have kids before they get married (if they even choose to get married, and if they do get married, it won't be in a church), and church/religion is nowhere in the picture at all. So these kids are growing up with 0 exposure to religion. 

I wonder how the next generation will be. Do you think there will be a religious revival in the West?",Catholicism

Chronic Sin,beffaroni_boi,1624419342,"To preface this post I must say that I understand there is most likely an answer I could simply look up online instead of posting a question about it here, but it feels better to get a second opinion on these kinds of things and so I've decided to go through with this. 

I am a recently turned 16 y/o male who has a chronic masturbation addiction. I have had this problem since I was 13 if I remember correctly and it has only worsened in recent years. I used to do it once a week  usually but then it turned into every few days, then every other day, and now I do it almost every day and the longest I've gone without doing it in the past year is 3 weeks. I've never been a strong willed person in the slightest but it's not an excuse and I hate myself more and more every time I do it. I've gone to confession at least 6 times in the past 4 months and yet I rarely last more than a week without failing to abstain, and then I do it every day until I go back to confession and start the whole process over again. I feel as though I'm spitting in God's face every time and I wish I could simply stop myself but I just don't know how. I go to the gym 4 times a week and exercise for 30 minutes at home by myself every day, I do work around the house and spend time with my family, and I play videogames to try and occupy myself as well, but no matter how busy I make myself, I always find at least 5 minutes to go and sin after I get the cravings. I just feel like such a sinful piece of crap all the time that takes advantage of the life he's given, I don't even think I'm worthy of wearing my grandparents necklace because of how lustful I am. So I would just like to put this out there as I'm clearly abnormal when it comes to this kind of thing and I need some kind of advice, heck, just someone to talk to about it for once would be nice.

is poverty created by god?,madrigalm50,1624418525,"So I was having a conversation with another christian, and I was telling him that since there are more empty homes then homeless people, we produce enough food for more people then are on earth, and without food and shelter you can die, that we should just give them to people that need them. 

he responded say that would take away people's choice of helping the poor and since Jesus commanded almsgiving and if we lose our ability to give to the poor, then we cannot obey Jesus's teachings, so the christian way to help the poor is through charity, voluntarily giving to the poor. I've heard a version of this argument from all types of Christians, including Catholics.  

my question is if we had the ability to get rid of poverty would it be unchristian to do so? If you wanted people to get help, would it matter to you if you had a choice or not? if we had enough food and housing for everyone doesn't that mean the reason people go hungry and homeless is because people chose not to give it to them? is people having the choice of whether or not to help poor more important then the need's of the poor? is that point of helping the poor to help the poor or for people to choose to help the poor? does this mean god creates poverty? how does he choose who's poor?

  ive attended catholic school for 10 years, and it just seems the more i read about the faith and the people that follow it, then further i am distanced from God. at catholic school, obviously we learned that homosexual acts were sinful, as undeniably from a catholic perspective, they are. 

   i have seen several catholics view lgbt as simply a “i like to have sex with men” situation. it’s hyper-sexualizing, and it’s not okay. lgbtq is more than just who you have sex with, it extends to romance and genuine love. as a bisexual male, reading these comments is invalidating, and threatens my sense of identity and compassion. i am not bisexual for sex, and that is not up for discussion. 

   you know, when i was in middle school, i spent countless nights trying to pray the gay away as you would call it. long story short, it doesn’t work. i have tried to be included in the catholic faith, but i cannot mentally tolerate this threat to my identity and heart. let’s please stop xx.",Catholicism

Spouses family believes in the occult,Brilliant_Counter_22,1624417584,"I have a very strong fear response, more so directed at possible influence. I inadvertently dabbled in the occult such as the ouija board when I was very young but thankfully superstition was never instilled on me

My spouse on the other hand, and this has been the source of a few arguments. I feel bad in how her parents instilled on her a deep belief - they all believe in witches and believe that one was involved in their siblings untimely but natural death, they believe in the evil eye and wearing red to deter it, and they believe that people can inflict curses on others 

This has been the source of many arguments where I thought we had an understanding very early on, way before marriage, that at the time any future children would absolutely not be taught any of these things but that boundary seems to have gone out the window with a dismissive “they can believe what they want about this kind of stuff.” To be clear I’m not perfect and not a good Catholic in any sense, but this is where I stand very firm and will not budge and what’s more worrying now is a deeper understanding of the occult and how you invite demons into your life, and I have made it very clear that neither she nor any of her family can perform any occult actions on my children - amulets superstitions whatever 

Not sure how to proceed from here. I have spoken to a priest about the topic in general and he heard me loud and clear said that he comes from the same culture that believes in these types of superstitions and at the time I felt that so many bad things were happening and just escalating and escalating , some my fault but the focus on ones that were not shaped by my own actions in any way - “bad luck” as they call it.

However, I still notice that I have a hard time detaching myself from my past life before Christ where I treasured the world over the Lord. The worst part is being scared of what people think. I am too embarrassed to pray or make the sign of the Cross. Then, when I’m placed into uncomfortable situations with my friends, I cannot say “no” sometimes even though I know it’s grave matter.",Catholicism

Help with Rosary History,Shanea10,1624404692,"Hello [r/Catholicism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/),

I  am trying to educate myself on the History of the Rosary, and how it  came to be, and I am just missing a few gaps, which hopefully you all can help me with.

Obviously the Rosary in Saint Dominic's time is a lot different than it is in present time. I understand a nice chunk of the evolution of it, like how the Luminous Mysteries came to be, where the second half of the Hail Mary Prayer came from, where the Fatima Prayer came from, how the name 'Rosary' came to be, etc. However, five things I do not know, and would like to be educated on, are on how the following came to be added to the  Current Rosary:

1.) Our Father Prayer

2.) Glory Be Prayer

3.) Salve Regina Prayer (The Hail Holy Queen)

4.) The Pendant

5.)  The four Prayers &amp; Beads at the beginning (Our Father, Hail Mary  x3) and the five Our Father + Mystery Beads. I am assuming the five Our Father + Mystery Beads got added simply when the Our Father's were added and it was just always natural to Pray an Our Father after announcing each Mystery.

And  just to give some overview of my current knowledge, I understand that  before the Hail Mary prayers, in the 9th Century the Monks originally  recited 150 Psalms, but the 150 Psalms were hard to memorize since they  lacked printed copies (the Printing Press wasn't yet invented), so they started to pray 150 Our Fathers. And then of course during St. Dominic's apparition, and the instruction of Mother Mary to preach her Angelic Psalter, this changed to 150 Hail Mary Prayers. So did they just  naturally add the Our Father Prayer overtime since Catholics in the past  had a history of praying it so often? I don't quite know. Additionally,  I am unsure if the Glory Be Prayer was requested by Our Lady during the Fatima apparitions in 1917, but I think it might have been.

6.)  Additionally as a 'bonus question', would someone be able to explain how the 15 Decades per day evolved into 5 Decades per day? Isn't a 'full Rosary' 15 Decades, and if so, is praying 5 Decades per day still ""sufficient""?

Strange Catholic Visions and Miracles.,PepsiCope,1624397847,"So I am thinking of doing RCIA in September but after learning about some Catholic saints, miracles and visions I'm not so sure about that anymore, I dont mean to disrespect anyone I just want my objections to be answered and not shouted down I mean no disrespect.

Saint Marie Marguerite Alacoque was said to have had a visions of Jesus where she had strange sexual experiences, she did bloodletting because apparently Jesus told her to do so and she apparently switched hearts with Jesus and this seems to be where heart worship comes from. And also these weird women saints that think the host in flying around the room and just strange spiritually especially among women saints like Jesus giving Saint Catherine a circumcision ring.

Stigmata is another thing that seems strange. It only appears after the Great Schism and only in Catholicism, first with St Francis of assisi. How is this a gift from God when you are undergoing great pain and how is this not mental illness that people perpetuate upon themselves in mental episodes when scripture says God gives good healing spiritual gifts not these horrific pains upon people which arent seen until much later on until after the schism between east and west ?

Marian Apparitions which seem to only happen much later in Christianity and the apparitions agree with things like immaculate conception and dogma seeking to be accepted at the time and the apparitions mostly appear young children and also seems to change the church as a whole. The apparitions seem to confirm a new dogma or establish a new devotion.

The idea of incorruption when a saints body wont decompose, but if we look at Padre Pio he has a silicon mask on his face and the Bernadette Soubirous who had wax put on her face to hide her decomposing body and when they exhumed her they saw she was practically mummified. This make me doubt incorruptibllity.

Alot of these supposed miracles and visions seem to be what the Orthodox would call Prelest I dont understand these supposed miracles and visions and seem only to come around thousand years after Christ, can anyone please answer my questions and also I dont mean to be mean or disrespectful just seeking answers thank you.",Catholicism
Bringing non Catholic friends to the faith?,TheKingsPeace,1624397449,"I am part of a young Catholic group at my church who focus on being a “ missionary” disciple and brining people into the fold.

I’ve been told that one nice way to bring people to the faith is through friendship.

Problem is though as I’ve grown deeper into the faith my secular friends have quietly dropped off.

It doesn’t make any sense to me, and definitely wasn’t something I’d desire. I’ve never even talked to them about Jesus per say. Nevertheless they do insist on sort of freezing me out and I have no indication when that will change.

Honestly the only non- devout Catholic friendship I have currently is with an Lutheran friend from high school and he at least shared a god based world view.

My family extended and some of my immediate family are largely Catholic in name only. They go to a parish but reject the more “ divisive” church teachings. What way could I possibly stand up for Jesus teaching and hope to truly change their mind.

Neither of my brothers are Catholic in a committed or meaningful way and my parents have not encouraged me to spread the good news of Catholicism to them.

Guidance through pregnancy before Marriage,RedishOrangeBull,1624389436,"My fiance (non-catholic but Christian - 29yrs old) and I (born Catholic - 32 yrs old) have been engaged for about a year and are planning on getting married in the catholic church in the Summer of 2022 (covid pushed our plans back). We have the church, priest, and date booked and are very excited. We haven't attended pre-cana yet.

A little while ago we messed up and had sex. Just a few weeks ago, we found out that we are expecting. We're very excited as starting a family is something we always hoped God had in his plan for us, but the timing is not anything we had anticipated. The baby will be born a few months **before** our planned wedding date in 2022.

Obviously, the church doesn't condone premarital sex, and I'll be heading to confession very soon, and we'll be talking to our priest soon about the next steps.

I've read a few things online but haven't found out any clear info on what the church recommends or how they handle situations like ours.

Some of what I read talks about forced or ""shotgun"" weddings, but we were engaged before this happened and we're not getting married **because** of the baby. Other things I've read are they recommend waiting 6-9 months after the baby is born before having the wedding. but again, My finance won't be pregnant during the wedding and I feel this applies more to shotgun-type weddings.

Something else I read said this is considered a ""scandal"" and the church won't let us have a big ceremony because it sets a bad precedence and the optics look bad. They will make us have a small witness-only wedding in the rectory.

Then on the flip slide, somewhere I read that as long as I have a good confession and am truly sorry then it's all fine.

We're feeling some pressure to quickly get married before the baby is born as neither one of because wanted to have kids out of wedlock, but life happens. We want to keep our wedding date the same because that date holds special meaning to us, and we still want to have the full ceremony with all our guests.

Like I said we set up a meeting with our priest and will talk about it soon with him, but I want to be prepared.

Considering joining an intentional discernment community but feel like an imposter.,vea_ariam,1624382380,"I was recently accepted into a new and local intentional discernment community. A community of likeminded men trying to discern God's will in their life while eating, praying and generally living together.
As someone who has put off his personal and faith development far too long I feel it would be an excellent opportunity to get closer to God and form my faith and self.
However I have a terrible imposter's syndrome surrounding this and feel I am fooling myself into thinking I can suddenly change upon entering the community. 
Another part of me feels it's the only way to make any progress. In my current home life I have little to no structure and find it extremely difficult to form any discipline. 
I live in habitual sin at most making it two or three days in a state of grace which has only gotten worse as I see the day approaching. I also have a secular but not strangling relationship with a woman and we've been getting more serious.

The crossroads seems to be either getting my life and faith together on my own with her or joining the community as a sort of boot camp towards that.
My fear is joining the community and not changing, struggling with the life and failing to live in a state of grace thus bringing down the whole group.
My other fear is forgoing this for the woman and regretting not going after/if our relationship ends or continuing to stagnate in my life and faith.

I have no idea what to do. I was very adamant in joining and believed I could do it until recently talking to my Priest who snapped me out of my dreaming and reminded me it will be difficult as well as the gap between who I am and who I would need to be.
He also reminded me of the existence of Satan and that it's the last thing he would want.
Regardless of particular vocation I know I'm called to holiness but am unsure I'd be able to attain that on my own. My fear is not being able to attain to anything even in the community. Also that I am perhaps being deceived by the devil in following this relationship.
There are also many things I would regret leaving behind, like my dog and various sinful or otherwise freedoms. I feel like the rich youth that went away sorrowful because he had many things. There is also a one year commitment which is intimidating.

School lesson,anonymous_anonymous9,1624379205,"Hello!

So, my History Teacher gave us a lesson about the Crusades. The problem is, that the PDF that he gave us to help to answers the questions of the lessons got me curious. As I really don't know much about the Crusades, I decides to search in Google to see if I could found a Catholic source about it (more specifically, as I'm Brazilian, I searches to see if Father Paulo Ricardo had something about it on his site, and he had). I used this site to answer the questions, because I didn't wanted to say something bad that I shouldn't say. So, to answer the majority of the questions I took quotes from the site, putting them in quotation marks, and I plan to put the link of the site together when sending it to the teacher.
But, for some reason, I don't know if it's okay to do it, so if anyone could simply answer if I'm doing the right thing in searching using a Catholic source to answer this, instead of using the source that the teacher send us, it would be a good help for me. Thanks!",Catholicism

Catholicism and Science - Fr George Lemaitre - The Priest who was behind the Big Bang Theory,TJB74,1624354134,"In some parts of the world it seems to have become a commonly held opinion that faith and science are incompatible or even worse in opposition 

The Catholic Church has many examples to counter this - and to show that you can have a deep faith and be a world famous scientist at the same time 

* Fr Georges Lemaitre' theories helped modern scientific cosmology take a huge leap forward, he is famous for proposing the ""Big Bang theory"" of the origin of the universe. 
* During World War I, writing a letter to a friend from the trenches: Lemaitre said “I have understood the ‘Fiat Lux’ “let there be light” as the reason of the universe.” 
* After he was ordained he became an expert on Einstein’s Theory of Relativity,  and demonstrated evidence that the space between galaxies was expanding i.e. the universe was not static. This would mean that Einstein's theory would need extending and at first Einstein accepted his mathematics, but rejected the physical interpretation. 
* In California, Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies were moving away at high speeds. iT helped Le Maitre's theory. He thought if you imagined the galaxies rushing away from us like a movie, then just run the movie backwards &amp; all  galaxies rush together meaning that there was once a primordial atom which had contained all the matter in the universe. 
* Atheist cosmologist Fred Hoyle, invented the name “Big Bang” as an insult,  considering it to be a religious idea in disguise.  However when Penzias and Wilson found evidence of cosmic background radiation.  LeMaitre had determined that this would be the residue of the big bang's explosion many billions of years ago.
* Lemaître had a profound but very personal spirituality. He was always transparent regarding his faith, no matter how inconvenient in scientific and academic circles and he always appears in photographs dressed in the garb of a Catholic priest 
* However, he was prudent and did not use his scientific position to proselytize and rarely mentioned his religious ideas in scientific contexts. In an interview in the New York Times, he spelled out this careful demarcation, *If the Bible does not teach science, among other things, what does it teach, you ask. “The way to salvation,” comes the reply. “Once you realize that the Bible does not purport to be a textbook of science, the old controversy between religion and science vanishes*.”

[Serious] How to get rid of sex altogether?,rock_bite002,1624350730,"I'm going to expect that all of you will comment that having sexual desires is not a bad thing but acting on them is. You will say to keep praying and offer up my suffering. You will say that I will get there because ""suffering is part of life"" and ""it is worth it.""

You know, I'm tired and frustrated of listening and reading those. I'm not trying to invalidate any of those advices, but they do not help me. I did pray and wait long plenty of times, more than you can imagine, but they did not work for me. Temptation is burdening and hardening me to the point that I become mentally exhausted and lose my self-esteem. There were times that I gave in due to the medical articles saying to do it to relieve stress. So, if you're about to comment me about that, just don't because I'll only feel more frustrated and eventually snap out of mental breakdown.

The Catholic Church says to not masturbate. Medical articles say to do it because it is healthy and relieves stress. Don't get me started on nofap because that community only feels like a cult and plenty of medical articles say that they only spread pseudoscience. Sure, there are anecdotes of people who succeed and are satisfied, but that does not guarantee that one can do the same. I don't feel satisfied at all by abstaining from masturbating.

I can't focus on the things that I always wanted to do because of my raging sex drive. I wanted to study math, but I can't because of my sex drive. I wanted to learn programming, but I can't because of my sex drive. I wanted to study physics, but I can't because of my sex drive. I tried distracting myself, but none of them worked. I tried listening to music, pursuing my interests and hobbies, exercise, sleep, healthy diet, none of those work. In fact, exercise only increases my sex drive and will only burden me. Nothing will stop my horny feelings unless I masturbate to orgasm. I lose to every situation. Every single medical article says that being horny is normal and that you should masturbate. It's very frustrating to read the teachings of the Church and those medical articles that I just stopped reading about those altogether.

I concluded to myself that I want to get rid of sex altogether because I want nothing to do with it. Anything involving sex only hinders me from pursuing my goals. I'm tired of hearing about sex whether it be from the Church or the secular society. Don't comment to me about not knowing what the Church teaches about sex and proceed on to put bible verses and lines from the Catechism because I already knew those and repeating them serves no benefit for me. Again, I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING INVOLVING SEX.

Take note that I also do not want to get married nor pursue any relationships. I prefer being single forever for personal reasons. I hate dealing with children and another person with me. In fact, while I have acquaintances, I do not have any close friends with me and that's fine with me. I am a very private person and I want nothing to do with marriage or whatever.",Catholicism
I think it’s quite amazing how the Christian faith is so ahead of its time.,SnakeAmethyst23,1624348221,"I was watching a murder documentary about this woman who ordered her lover to kill her husband and because of her lustful and adulterous desires, they drove her to murder her husband. So the woman not only broke the Sixth Commandment but also the First, Fifth and Ninth Commandments. 

It’s quite interesting how most sins connect with each other one way or another and how it makes sense God gave us the Ten Commandments to be our guide. 

Like when you think about it, even though chastity is difficult for most men and women, it makes sense why God ordered us to observe it. The consequences for not following it are destructive: STDs, high divorce rate, marriage dissatisfaction, single parenthood, abortion, rape, sexual abuse, low birth rates, adultery, pornography, sexual dysfunction, polygamy, incest, sodomy, etc. Even murder is a consequence (citing the murder documentary example above).

Sometimes being a Christian feels way too painful,boyhero97,1624343508,"Sometimes being the only devout Catholic in my immediate family is so overwhelming.

It's just so overwhelming to think that the chances of seeing any of them in Heaven is slim to none and I get so depressed it makes me cry. I try so hard. I pray for them, I invite my mother (the one I see as the best chance of being saved) to church. When it comes up with my sisters I try to push as gently as I can because I'm their brother and if I push too hard then they'll just shut down and refuse to talk to me about it. The one sister I can kind of push always says she feels bad and wants to get better about it, but then never does. Same with my mother (yet she almost always finds a reason not to go to church with me). My dad feels like a lost cause. I don't know. I've always thought he had some bad experience growing up and that turned him away from religion. He borderline hates it. Sometimes I think, just for a fleeting second, ""what's the point in being in heaven when everyone I love is not?"" At this point it looks like the only family I'll see in heaven is my grandma and maybe my grandpa. I just love them all so much and they're all such great people despite this one flaw, I can't stand that when they die that'll be it. I won't ever see them again.

[body Politics Monday] I really don't like this commercial for women's shorts and here is why . . .,nessiewatcher4lyfe,1624338413,"I've seen this commercial for women's athletic shorts on the boob-tube one too many times and I've aired my grievances to others so I'll air them on this sub as well. I could link to the video on YouTube but I think that'd be counterproductive since I don't like the commercial. I'll just explain what I don't like about it and hopefully help others to understand why Catholic morals are at the root of why it bothers me.

The commercial has like a background recitation of some lady talking about the strength of their legs. It is very poetic and there follows a bunch of clips of women wearing this spandex shorts which are basically yoga pants I guess but they're shorts. So imagine an even more immodest yoga pant. That's the product. They're basicaly prancing around in tight underwear--except it's not a Fruit of the Loom commercial, you're supposed to go jogging in these or wear them in the gym or something.

So all these ladies are running around in spandex shorts, clips of their tough and smiling faces, a woman who is missing a leg (God bless her), but then it oversteps the boundaries, it mixes kids up into the scene. So you've got all these different shapes and sizes of women displaying the product (spandex pants) and then you have some young girls thrown into the mix to I guess display child's sizes. If this product is really immodest, as I personally think it is, what's been done is these children have been tricked into selling immodesty. That's evil! ! !

Now, I'm not accusing the company of directly being evil, but more indirectly, like maybe they're the product of this awful culture which is running amok. I think the idea behind the whole of the scenes, coupled with the poem, is like look at all these women, young and old (except there are really no old women in the commercial), they're all the same. It tries to depict women's bodies as being fundamentally *innocent* like a child's. But the fact is they're simply *not*, they're adults, so the result is the opposite. What you're doing is elevating the bodies of children to the level of adults, essentially sexualizing them, whether you intended to do so or not.  


The problem is this: the culture at large refuses to acknowledge Original Sin. Yet if you refuse to acknowledge Original Sin, that opens the gateway to all kinds of sins, some of them very dark, and you harm everybody in the process. If you believe you're Adam or Eve, living in some kind of *mithuna* with the world around you, you're living in delusion. The reality is that we're all so flawed that it is written into our very nature, inscribed upon our flesh like the mark of Cain. We're thoroughly wicked, sinners all. And commercials are both a byproduct of a sinful world and a facilitator for sin itself. 

If only there were a counter-culture which could provide us with a set of morals that benefit the entire human person by protecting the dignity of all. . . oh wait, to quote another commercial (M and M's Christmas 90s): *It Does Exist! ! !*",Catholicism
Am I the only person who thinks the Catholic Church in the United States is a disaster when it comes to young adults?,VerticalFury,1624335341,"I was born and raised Catholic, being the son of two polish immigrants to the US.  I was baptized and confirmed in the Church.  But as I went through my teenage years and into adulthood, I became somewhat disillusioned with the Catholic Church.  For one, my family was very poor growing up.  We moved around frequently and it was difficult for me to make friends and develop socially.  My younger brother was diagnosed as severely autistic (and is now currently institutionalized).  My parents had a horrendous divorce that set everyone back even further financially.  Fast forward to now, I’m a 30 year old single guy who still goes to mass and attends the sporadic young adult event when I have time.  However, all of my past experiences came at a very steep cost.  I can’t help but think that the Catholic Church is a trainwreck, when it comes to young adults.

For one, whenever I go to a Sunday Catholic mass, it’s like I’m in a Catholic nursing home.  It’s mostly older people and a handful of middle aged couples with children peppered into the mix.  The number of young adults in a given mass can be counted using your fingers.  There is no young adult group or ministry for my parish.  The Diocese as a whole holds a sporadic young adult event, but the turnout is really weak.

In terms of the Masses themselves, I always thought the mass was pretty dry and hard to sit through at times.  It also didn’t help that half the time, a priest from the developing world was performing the mass.  I don’t have anything against people from other countries, but I don’t think a priest from the developing world is going to fully understand the issues of people from the US.  I always got the vibe that developing world priests assumed that everyone in the parish was rich.

With marriage these days, I feel like it’s a risky proposition, especially if you are a man.  From what I’ve seen, marital law in the US basically allows a woman to rape a man financially.  The Church doesn’t really care about this issue.  The Church doesn’t even really educate people on the legalities of marriage.

And in terms of politics, the Catholic Church is ABORTION ABORTION ABORTION!!!!  For me personally, I think abortion is a really important issue.  I think it is killing an unborn child.  I’m a very socially conservative person.  But I would not make it my #1 issue.  Growing up in a poor family, I feel really disillusioned by this.  I feel like the Church doesn’t take the issue very seriously at all.  VERY RARELY would a priest ever do a homily on excessive materialism in the US.  And if you try to bring up government policies that could really help the poor, most US Catholics are against it.  I’ve been accused of being a Marxist by some conservative Catholics, as I am way more left wing economically than most Democratic politicians.  For me personally, I think protecting the environment and wealth inequality are more important than the issue of abortion.  A lot of young adults (millennials and Gen-Zers) are struggling to make ends meet.  Some people are doing just fine, but many can’t afford to buy houses, start families, live on their own, etc.  I feel like the Catholic Church brushes these things aside and devotes all of its energy to . . . you guessed it . . . abortion.

I’ve even met with the Bishop of my Diocese to talk about a few of these things.  He listened to what I had to say but I doubt he was really open to anything, as the Diocese was working to control the fallout of the abuse scandal in my area.

So as the title states, I’m asking if I’m the only one who thinks the Catholic Church is doing a poor job of guiding young adults and addressing the issues that affect them?",Catholicism

What's draw of converting to Catholicism or Christianity in general other than the chance at not being tormented for eternity?,Vault_Bot,1624332873,"I am most definitely not anti Catholic or christian, but as a lgbt pagan this is something that's interested me, I've been told by some Christians that it's okay I'm gay saying the common line of ""I don't think gays go to hell"" while others are more than happy to convince me the only way to salvation is through being straight and worshiping Jesus, and proudly tell me anything else is an express ticket to hell.

I'm digging a hole,alainpi,1624332276,"Hi everyone!

I need to speak out loud

At the beginning of this year I was in a very healthy and chaste relationship with a girl that I thought I was going to marry. Long story short, I became complacent, let things get bad, and decided that I did not want to be with her anymore because of problems that I had caused. We broke up and I got over it a little too quickly. 

Fast forward to now. I moved to a big city for an internship this summer with nobody I know within hundreds of miles other than those that I work with. I met a girl and I'm sleeping with her regularly now. I haven't felt this lonely in years. I am using her for comfort, but I'm poor in spirit and don't want to stop.

I've done things in the past that have taken a toll on my spirit. I've been forgiven by the party involved, but I need therapy because of my actions. I've never sought out that help because I'm a coward and I don't like talking to people about my problems. 

My future on Earth is bright. I have what the world tells us to want, but I don't want it. I can't stand the routine I'm in. I'm depressed. I have never talked about my depression to a soul other than strangers who I will never see again. In other words, people that I'll never have to face. I know the truth, I know my family would love me if I opened up about it, but I can't. I have to face them.

Things are spiraling, but I continue to justify my decisions with ""Just for the summer"". If I died tomorrow I would not go to heaven.

How to stop thinking I don't deserve God's blessings,Worried_Bid6418,1624331537,"Hello, everyone. I'm 24 and Female. 
I was born and raised as a Catholic so I am very happy to have found this subreddit. 😊

I am not sure my post here should belong because it involves some perspectives on career, work, and mindsets but I know this would also involve spirituality and Catholic faith. 

I know that many are experiencing difficulties and struggles in life now especially since the onset of the pandemic. I was one of those blessed enough to have resigned from work in 2020 and was able to be hired immediately in a new job. 

I know that I am blessed and am really grateful to have found a job which also pays better than my previous. I was able to start supporting my family as it was really my goal as a first born to support my family and have this innate urgency inside of me to be the breadwinner (even though my parents do not require me at all).

I am working as an auditor in one of the multinational companies and the job is really interesting at first. I am now on my 11th month.
But as time goes by, I became depressed. The department I belong has a very competitive environment and I really struggle how to keep up and display noticeable and huge progress. I always go to sleep at night thinking how to perform well in my job and worrying I might get fired for underperforming. I always have the toxic thoughts that maybe my teammates are thinking I am so stupid to have my role. I also have thoughts that maybe my manager who is also the one who hired me, has the regrets now. 

As days go by I became very depressed (up until now) that I am starting to think why God has led me to this job if I wouldn't be thriving on it. I started to think that I don't deserve this grace He has given me cause I am not able to make good progress. I am really wondering how would I be able to take good care and value this wonderful gift (this job) he has given me if I really suck at it? I would like to think that this is just an imposter syndrome but it's been half a year now and I always cry myself to sleep. 
I pray and also do the rosary but there's still this heaviness in my heart. I feel like I no longer have control in my development and I keep sinking everyday. 

I have always been dreaming to become a CPA and work as an auditor and God was really merciful to have granted these dreams. 
But I am just wondering what's happening now.
I can't really quit the job becauae as I have mentioned, I can already support my family and I see the happiness in my family. 
But I am depressed. 

Can somebody suggest other prayers I need to do? Or some verses that I can read repeatedly to uplift my heavy heart? 

I am also asking for your prayers. I know this is not the worst problem in the world, but I am going crazy with these thoughts and I don't want to always be questioning and scorning God's blessings. 

I just want to stop thinking I don't deserve God's grace. I just want to press on even if now I just want to give up.

Thank you and stay safe.",Catholicism

Mortal Sin Opinion,Informal-Amphibian-4,1624330971,"Curious about your take on this situation. Mostly how you would judge the situation and how you would have handled it. 

Due to unforeseen circumstances I needed to replace a vehicle in order to hold a job and perform necessary errands and duties. I don't make much money so choice in vehicles was limited. My parents were willing to sell me one of their cars which I agreed to. 

This is where things get messy. Their expectation was that I would report it to the DMV as a gift and not a purchase so I could evade the sales tax. My parents aren't Catholic and believe lying ""is okay if it benefits you"" and even though it wouldn't be their money they would be livid if I did something that in their minds is ""so unthinkably stupid and irrational."" When they came to drop the car off from out state they insisted on coming to the DMV with me so they could make sure I got the sales tax written off. (They probably didn't trust that I'd lie if they weren't around.) I wouldn't say they forced me but you could say they coerced me and there was the threat of repercussions (and not just in terms of not having a car).

Now before you come at me and say that as an independent adult I don't have to listen to them and such things just understand that the family dynamics and situation here are extremely complicated. 

The other aspect to this is that I'm paying the car off on a payment plan. However I'm sure that if at some point there was no way I could pay it off (a greater than average chance) they would probably let me keep the vehicle at least partially or in name essentially making it gift. I was aware of this as a likely possibility before I purchased it (and I suspect my parents did as well and were willing to relinquish it as a gift if it came to that). 

I know I need to confess it and I'm also thinking I need to call the DMV and report myself and pay the tax and any penalties for lying. Would you do anything else to make reparation?",Catholicism

Canon 915,tastypasta18,1624328994,"“Those who have been excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty and others obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion.”

In other words, those who any given bishop or priest knows to be persevering in repetitive and public mortal sin while refusing to repent or change their behavior are to be told not to present themselves for Communion until they have a change of heart and refused the sacrament if they do so anyway. This applies to all such individuals and all such sins, not just supporting abortion. These individuals, per Canon 916, have a responsibility to not present themselves for the sacrament but are highly unlikely to do so, necessitating this measure as an act of mercy and a guard against sacrilege. Unfortunately, few of our shepherds are willing to abide by this canon. This needs to be done widely and consistently so that Our Lord is protected, the integrity of the Church is maintained, the Church’s teaching on the Eucharist is better understood and accepted, and no such acts are interpreted as being political in nature.",Catholicism

The Temptation to Despair,nillin_wafer,1624320180,"Brothers and sisters, this has been in my heart. I pray my words go beyond my own capacity.

I was listening to a sermon delivered by the Venerable Fulton Sheen this afternoon on the Devil and he quite lucidly highlighted that at a societal level, the goal of the diabolic is to cause the people to fall into despair (and, I would summarize, into ennui), since this is the opposite of the Cross and what Christ offers to us, namely redemption, forgiveness, and grace. It was unfortunately relevant that he should point out the prevalence of despair, as I would contend that our world is currently caught up in cycles of despair. I know I tend to feel it myself.

I offer some encouragement in tandem to this wisdom from my own considerations and strivings. Remember that “each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire” (Js‬ ‭1:14‬) and that “Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour” ‭‭(1 Pet 5:8‬). Yet here Peter echoes God’s words to Cain from Genesis 4: “sin is couching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.” He goes as far as to offer a like solution, “Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experience of suffering is required of your brotherhood throughout the world” (1 Pet‬ ‭5:9‬).

We all have desires: perhaps the desire to be loved, or to follow one’s calling. At any point, we have the opportunity to allow these desires to fall into sinful disorder, and even more so in our given context, I believe we are uniquely poised to fall into despair due to the lack of fulfillment of our desires. The desire to be loved, for example (and to love!), ought to be directed to our Lord, to fellow believers, and when appropriate to a spouse. Out of impatience or heartbreak, we may turn to sexual immorality, or to unhealthy friendships, which equally cause us to despair by their failure to truly satisfy. Even our well-intentioned search for meaningful and sacramental love (in a marriage) can lead us to despair if we do not feel the gratification or satisfaction of reaching our goal. The temptation to despair can rear it’s head anywhere.

I admonish you, brothers and sisters, as one who sometimes sorrowfully lifts up his cross in service of our Lord, to resist the urge to despair. It is not what we were made for, nor does it glorify our Father in Heaven. There is no need for groundless optimism as a strategy of self-assurance, for this escapism can be just as bad. Hold fast to what is true; persist in prayer for one another. Remember the words of Peter directly following his warning about the Devil: “And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen you. To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen” (1 Pet‬ ‭5:10-11‬).",Catholicism

What if I mess this up.. what will THEY think if I do, what do they think of me now... etc.” It’s disconcerting and I’m tired of it, because I know that it’s disordered.

Managing temper/short fuse &amp; improving patience,DontGiveUpTheShip-,1624315445,"Right to the point: I tend to get very ""snappy"" lately at people. Family, friends, coworkers, and strangers. If it's a coworker or stranger and something they do annoys me I usually wind up making a remark &amp; being rude before walking away. If it's a family member or friend I kind of snap then isolate myself after because I feel ashamed I acted the way I did. Today I kind of got sour with my girlfriend because her doctor suggested she go on an antidepressant and I feel like she's not depressed and that she just needs to start exercising &amp; eating better again. I'm retaliation/out of spite I said I'm not going to a doctor's appointment I have in a few weeks. I have a pretty big mistrust of doctors &amp; pharmaceuticals because they have misdiagnosed me in the past, told me to take pills I didn't need (confirmed by other doctors later on), and they even gave me a surgery on an injury as a teenager that they knew wasn't going to work and it wound up making the injury worse in the long run. That's why I got mad at the doctor (but took it out on her) because I feel like he's just being lazy and saying ""just take a pill"" instead of suggesting lifestyle changes first.

I feel like my temper has gotten worse over time, but  especially worse this past year. The past year changed me in two ways- I became Catholic/went through RCIA, because I realize Christ is the only truth we can depend on in this world, but it also jaded me because everyday I see the media &amp; the government gaslighting us, spitting on Christian values, lying to the public, society gets sicker, etc. It really frays me- and this is without watching the news since I don't have TV.

I'm normally pretty level headed and easy going but lately I feel like I lash out at people more and more &amp; my patience is thinner and my ability to hide my annoyance is non-existent.

Any advice- related to Catholicism or not- or any prayers or practices anyone has found helpful? It is starting to bleed into my personal relationships. Not only that but when I get in those moods I feel further from God because I spend the rest of my day trying to not be annoyed any longer and I keep playing it over and over in my head.

I try to get good sleep (although that could always be improved), been starting to exercise again as of late, and eat a pretty healthy diet already. I say the Rosary most days of the week.",Catholicism

Question about baptism,Exporite,1624313104,"Hi everyone, I am a 14 year old who wants to be baptized.

I have believed in god since the concept was introduced to me by my grandma when I was about 6, but I do not go to church consistently only because currently my closest church is about an hour and a half away. However very soon Im moving to a small farm town in Michigan which happens to have a church right down the road from my farmhouse, so I will begin going to church every Sunday.

For context, the only person in my family that was baptized is my grandmother, the rest of my family unfortunately are not super religious, but I would like to be. My father left shortly before I was born and I am an only child. 

I am not super clear on what is required to be baptized, but I do know you should be a regular atendee of the church which I plan to do. But from what my grandmother told me, you need to either have two catholic relatives or catholic godparents? She was not very clear on it either, but I do not have godparents nor do I know anybody outside of my family that is catholic, believe it or not.

I sincerely share in your frustration. However, I caution you to tread carefully. Those who enter the muddy morass of politics can expect to get covered in the muck and the mire. Politics nowadays is a toxic, information warfare devoid of reason or dialogue wherein ""both sides"" weaponize everything and attack the enemy. In this world, we may be forced to enumerate every last possible variation of acceptable personal belief for all public figures to adhere to before anyone is considered ""in line"" enough to receive the sacrament. Opponents will be quick to point out those Catholic politician sinners among us who have taken the route of “It’s OK for me; evil for thee”--or worse, dredge up some of the Catholic Church's past failures. You can expect every flavor of whataboutism, carpet-bombed culture war and gleeful and acidic sparring between Catholics and politicians (which we've already seen on this subreddit) and the eventual politicization of more and more territory. Think my warnings are hyperbole? I just urge you to think again. In the end, nobody wins--certainly not Catholics. 

Lastly, I urge you to consider the words of Pope Francis: Communion “is not the reward of saints, no, it is the bread of sinners. This is why \[Jesus\] exhorts us: ‘Do not be afraid! Take and eat.’”

A small but personally impactful 2022 Voting Dilemma,Heartbeat1215,1624302118,"Thanks to anyone who replies.  This is a serious question and has been bothering me.  So, Catholics please reply.

I don’t drink or do pot.  Simple.   However, I do vape having been a former smoker.  On our 2022 ballot will be the banning of flavored tobacco including vape.  The reason offered is because flavored tobacco is appealing to minors who are lured into vaping.

OK, so how would you vote?

Here is the problem I have

1) My community has quite a few vape stores which are small businesses.  These will certainly go out of business if the ban goes through.  I’m friendly with a few of the owners, so personally it would be bad if they went out of business.

2). My state is banning flavored tobacco, but leaves out expensive tobacco like cigars because the wealthy smoke that.  So, it seems hypocritical and a dig at us working class.  

3) The state legalized pot and was on the forefront of legalizing it.  So, how much do they really care about children if pot is legal but flavored vape is not?


So, do you see my dilemma?  It seems the right thing to is vote to ban flavored vape, “because of the children.”  But is that just rhetoric and persuasion masking subjective biases?

Would it be a sin if I vote no on banning flavored vape?

Near death experience and Jesus message.,DependentShirt8089,1624298853,"I’ve been watching a lot of people talk about near death experiences.  A common thread that you hear among all these people is they feel their soul pulled from their body and they enter a place resembling heaven or hell.  Regardless at some point they encounter Jesus and he sends them back.  A lot of times he has a message like “tell people about me”.  

Just a speculation but why don’t you think he says go become Catholic or something like that?  

Assuming these people are all telling the truth I figure Christ keeps it short and sweet for a reason.  My guess is that it’s better that these people evangelize their Protestant brothers and sisters and make them more convicted in Jesus.  He knows that not everyone will come to see the entire truth as it relates to worship.  But rather at least they can more easily get a taste by excepting Jesus as Christ.

Evangelical Protestant Conversions,jasonmccarley,1624296259,"I was just thinking about a miracle scenario where all protestants were converted to Catholicism and I really can't imagine what it would look like. I myself am a convert and have a ton of experience in the evangelical protestant world. A massive difference is seen when you compare the mass to a typical evangelical church service. I can't help but think that most evangelicals just won't be able to accept the stark contrast. 

Musical worship in an evangelical church is basically a pop concert that is hyper charged with emotion and zeal that is just not visibly apparent in most masses. The things about the mass that appealed to me as a convert (reverence, tradition, structure) I feel are the exact things most modern evangelical churches rail against, and this aspect is often what draws most attendees to those churches. To be honest, the liturgy of the mass played a very small part in my conversion. I was much more compelled by the Eucharist itself, the history of the church, and the apologetic arguments made for its legitimacy as the one true church founded by Jesus Christ. However, I don't think these things matter as much to most evangelicals. It seems to me that most are really just looking for some kind of emotional connection, and that is what they are finding at these protestant churches during their worship services. 

I don't think the church should adopt the modern practices of these protestant churches, but I can't deny how these gaps must and will be a huge stumbling block for many evangelical christians when they look at the Catholic church. How can these conversions be achieved? And what would the Church even look like afterwards? Crazy to think about really... My prayer is that the presence of the Holy Spirit is felt and is stirred up in the hearts of those who attend the mass. And that in each mass the reality of the miraculous true body and blood of Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist is realized in the minds of those who kneel in its presence.",Catholicism

"Want to receive baptism, Eucharist and confirmation, but I have no money. It's NOT free in my area.",ilyrs,1624293239,"I live in Germany.

My current situation forced me to struggle in a bad financial situation. I don't have much money and can't afford to spend more than some pennies.

After two years of casually reading theology and apologetics, I began to feel a great need to convert, a need coming from my heart, filling me with warmth. I YEARN for baptism and Eucharist, pray every day and want to be a part of the Catholic Church. 

But I don't have the money.

If you belong to a church in Germany - that is, you received baptism - you have to pay 9% more tax. Sure, it's not a large amount, but due to my situation I cannot afford paying more every month because I'm already barely making it. I don't want to end up destitute. And you will not get any sacraments in this country without paying the church tax. I called a local priest, he told me that if I want to receive sacraments, I HAVE to pay the tax. If I get baptized, the only way not to pay them is to officially apostasize at the office. Sure, I can get baptized quietly if I find a person, but what about the confirmation? It's an official sacrament usually reserved for a bishop. And if anyone asks, I will be forced to lie. I don't want to lie.

So what do I do? Is the only way out to wait for a better financial situation and paying the tax?",Catholicism

Hope in Yesterday's Gospel,Fun-Mycologist5759,1624290715,"Mark 4:35-41

I am as concerned with many events happening within the Church as you all are. I am saddened by the stance in Germany. I am concerned about the Eucharist situation in America. I'm worried by the amount of anti-Catholic sentiment in this increasingly-atheistic, -individualistic, and -autonomic free-for-all.

I was deeply encouraged by yesterday's Gospel. In an imperfect analogy, I saw the Church as the boat, and we the disciples. Christ Jesus was there all the time as He promised - peaceful and undisturbed. But we were floundering at the waves of attack, the wind of taunts and threats, the perceived threat of capsizing in a world of chaos and madness.

Yes, how miraculous was the instantaneous calming of these storms! The power of our God! But to note, the need for us to recognise our lack of faith in Him, and in His Church against these enemies.

If you are in my boat, and also feel quite desolate about worldwide or local ongoings, perhaps this little reflection I had yesterday could bring about some comfort, hope, and draw strength from the Church which will forever have Christ as it's Head, and ""the gates of Hades shall not overcome it.""

"Vatican's II ""Dignitatis humanae"" about Religious Liberty vs. Pope Pius' IX Syllabus of Error - Are both contradictory to each other?",hereintransylvaniaaa,1624289976,"I tried to get answers here in another thread, but didn't get any answer on that

Vatican II says about religious liberty:

&gt; This Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious liberty. Such liberty consists in this: that all men must be immune to coercion whether on the part of individuals, social bodies or any human power so that in religious matters no one is constrained to act against his conscience or prevented from acting in accordance with his conscience in private and in public, alone or with others, within due limits [these due limits are defined in paragraph 7 as being those of public peace and morality].

&gt;It further declares that the right to religious liberty is truly founded on the very dignity of the human person as known by the revealed word of God and reason itself.

&gt; This right of the human person to religious liberty in the juridical ordering of society is to be recognised so as to become a civil right.

Whereas Pope Pius' IX Syllabus of Error clearly condemns the following statement:

&gt; Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true.

We are bound to believe that V2 is ""in line with the early teachings"", i.e. we have to interpret everything V2 says ""in the light of tradition""

But I literally can't find any mental gymnastics here to interpret what V2 said to be in line with what Pope Pius IX said (that religious liberty is wrong)?

"If this article accurately reflects Rome's position, what does that mean for the future of the church?",infinityball,1624286972,"I just read this article from the NY Times, about the Vatican's reaction to the USA bishops' recent vote on eucharist guidance.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/world/europe/pope-francis-vatican.html

I know, I know, it's the Times. But the Vatican they describe seems to be one that has no interest in ever denying anyone communion for any reason, which desires to greatly liberalize the church, and has decided to play the long game and eventually replace retired conservative USA bishops with liberals that are more ""in line"" with Vatican priorities.

(I also want to apologize for using the ""conservative/liberal"" phraseology, because I think it's often oversimplified, but I'm not sure what else to use.)

Does this accurately reflect the state of the Vatican, or Catholicism worldwide? Is the USA simply an anomaly, with the rest of the world happily ""moving on"" from any concerns about orthodoxy and instead adopting a purely social mission?

If the Vatican really is hostile to upholding orthodoxy and simply plans to eventually replace orthodox bishops with more ""flexible"" ones, what does that mean for Catholic claims? I know how narrowly papal infallibility is defined, but if the Vatican is the active force behind reducing orthodox bishops worldwide ... well, that seems to be a negative data point at least. Isn't Rome supposed to be the protector of orthodoxy? What if it's the opposite, at least when making appointments if not in official doctrinal pronouncements?

This has me very concerned.

I bought a book containing the Gospel of Mary, Peter, Thomas, the Birth of Mary, and the Acts of Pontius Pilate from Amazon because it was cheap. I have been reading through each book and highlighting/making notes/researching as I go. 

How do Catholics (and other Christians) view these books, and other Nag Hammadi texts? I have tried googling this and got very confusing answers. Are they reliable as far as teachings of Jesus? Are they reliable as far as the background on the people they discuss?",Catholicism

""All the religions are super funny to me... The story of Jesus makes no  sense to me. God sent His only Son. Why could God only have one son and  why would He have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really  terrible in about the second act.""

Yearning to come back…,Fosterbilly90,1624249207,"Thank you for reading this. Long time lurker and finally have to say something. 

I am 31 years old. Lifelong Catholic, Catholic school and high school my entire life. Met a Catholic girl in 2011 and married in 2017. 

I stopped attending mass around 18 years old(2008ish) not because I don’t believe or have doubt. Just too busy with the wrong friends and drinking excessively and all around not a lot of great decisions. I’ve continued to pray the entire time and especially in times of need, which always makes me feel guilty and a bad conscious I only talk to God when I need something. 

Anyhow I’ve straightened my life up the last couple years immensely and am now raising a 2 year old son. Work hard. Provide for my family. For the last 3-4 years but especially the last year I have this overwhelming need to to go church. Like a calling almost. Everything I do during the day turns into my thinking about needing back in and needing confession and mass. I just want to kneel and pray. It’s partly like a very guilty conscious and also the fact of wanting to just be a better person and raise my son in the faith. I just want to be a better person, and I feel
Like I was always working on being a better person when I was going to mass weekly. 

Anyhow a few questions and I guess I just need advice, guidance and support. 
 
I’ve since moved from the area of my local church and it’s not the closest any longer. The closest church is very small and I’m so worried about a sense of clickyness and I feel like if I get anxiety or feel unwelcome. I’ll never go back. 

I know I need confession to go back and receive Eucharist. Im unsure where to even start after being gone for so long. 

My wife also hasn’t practiced since before we met But she is open to the idea of returning. She doesn’t seem as enthusiastic as I am. Any tips on helping her want to come. I don’t want to feel like I’m forcing it on her. 

We are legally married but did not get married in the church. I will speak about this when I attend confession but just curious what we have to do. 

So many questions and I guess concerns. Have this yearning to come back so bad it’s all I think about and read about.

"Really struggling to understand the definition of ""servile work""",Dependent-Summer2043,1624236627,"I'm really trying to stay out of mortal sin... I'm in the middle of a huge project at my mom's (she's been struggling with some hoarding issues, and I've taken a break on employment for the summer to get the house together for her and go through things/get rid of stuff/deep clean). So far, on Sundays, I've taken them off from cleaning, but sometimes I run into the issue of partially finished projects that are awkward to just leave the whole day. For example, this week I was deep cleaning and reorganizing the living room, and I got to the point where I'm almost done besides cleaning off a table, dusting it, vaccuming a portion of the living room, and putting the furniture back.

My reasons for doing this arent completely selfless (although wanting my mom to live in a clean environment is a part of it.. Its not anywhere near like the show but its pretty gross). A big reason is being back at home and wanting it to feel like a home instead of just a house. I'm trying to heal from some old emotional scars, and this is one of those things I gave up on years ago and it really strained our relationship, so as much as I hate to say it, its very about me. She's older now and has a bad back, so she doesnt clean beyond dishes.

I do take days off when I need them and try to make them Sundays, but sometimes, I need to rest from it on other days then I find myself losing a day or two, and I run into the issue where I want to continue working on it but then it's Sunday and I feel like I can't do any of it. Then sometimes Ive spent the whole week cleaning up the other rooms, and mine is in chaos because doing everything else here has been a full time job (sometimes it feels like more hours), which leaves me feeling like I wasted time staring at the mess I want to fix some days. I still go to church in the mornings then i go out to eat with my grandma and aunt and spend time with them. The end goal is to not have to do this on Sundays and have the house together... Then pick one day a week for normal maintenance cleaning. There's just so much to do right now. Over a decade of dust, reorganizing every shelf and cleaning them off, etc.

I don't know if I'm reading too much into this... I recently came back to the church, and I am completely confused. I'm not sure if this type of work is forbidden because it is definitely a lot of labor. I don't want to make God upset with me or anything, but I also really am trying to use this to make our house welcoming (since I'm back at home) instead of chaos, and mend my relationship with my mom.",Catholicism
Question on Canon 844 §2 and validity of sacraments,paddjo95,1624236497,"So basic Catholic theology states that only the sacraments administered through a validly ordained Catholic priest or bishop are valid. 

I was reading canon law and came across this to it: “Whenever necessity requires it or true spiritual advantage suggests it, and provided that danger of error or of indifferentism is avoided, the Christian faithful for whom it is physically or morally impossible to approach a Catholic minister are permitted to receive the sacraments of penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick from non-Catholic ministers in whose Churches these sacraments are valid.”

"Angry, upset, and worried about not being able to make it to Mass due to my job. Any advice?",hasbeenstillcatholic,1624233438,"So I work in retail. I do like my job and do well at it (though most people can) but I have an issue. Basically I only have every other weekend off and my new schedule has me close on Saturday nights and work on Sundays, and I just found out the one parish in my city that had a pre covid Sunday evening mass has not brought it back. So I feel like I'm stuck not going to mass or streaming (though I'd rather be there in person.

First of all, is there anything I can do. I'm worried that at my job, no one will really care about me wanting to get to mass. No one else really goes AFAIK except for some of the part time old people and in spite of it being a conservative environment, its also an environment where actual religious attendance isn't a big deal and most put their job ahead of other things, so I'm worried I won't be given time off for mass?

Second, and this is more of a rant, but I'm kind of angry. If anything, we need more masses and we need to make sure EVERYONE has masses they can go to. However, it seems as if you are some poor loser shift worker like me, then good luck finding an actual mass. I guess only the Susans and Karens of the world can attend their mass and then go out shopping the rest of the day while I and others work. It makes me mad at the culture too because everything now is open early and its all about convenience and on some level I wish that at least stuff wasn't open on Sunday until noon at the very least, or have things closed, but that won't happen. Sadly those with more cushy jobs that don't work weekends want to have their cake and eat it too and can go to mass while I can't.

Thirdly, it makes me feel like a loser because I have a ""crappy"" job. It sucks because my anxiety made my former career as a teacher so hard that I quit and to be honest I don't know what else I can do, and being some low end worker not only makes me feel like others think I'm a loser, but also that I'm a bad father and a bad Catholic because my wife works and I make less money than her and therefore I'm weak. I know that's not true, but I've seen this from some Catholics. I even had a friend tell me to ""get a real job"" so I can take care of my family and faith. It just sucks.

Finally, I'm mad at how it seems our priests and bishops and even fellow parishioners seem to give the shaft to more working class Catholics, and Catholics lay people who don't think of the rest of us. It sucks that more masses can't happen and it sucks that people whose job it is to promote the church are failing to do so. Its as if few people actually really believe, even our priests and bishops.

How do you think of the relationship between gender and sex?,walmartgeralt,1624226085,"I have long believed that gender and sex, though they go together as male/man and female/woman the majority of the time, can occasionally dissociate and someone can objectively ""be"" one sex and yet subjectively ""feel"" that they are another gender.

However, I also buy the argument that God does not make mistakes, and so it would be wrong to deny your objective sex through reassignment surgery or some such. But is there an issue in, for example, being a biological male and yet adhering to traditionally feminine gender norms, such as wearing lipstick or dresses?

"Almsgiving, nonprofits, and spiraling",emptyyellowbowl,1624222136,"We're called to give money to the poor, but how do we do that exactly? 

I don't give money to homeless people when I see them, largely because I don't carry cash. But in the event that I have given them money, it just seems not terribly useful. I don't give them enough for a hotel room. Maybe they use it for food and clothing? The cliche is that they use any cash they get for drugs/alcohol, and it seems counterproductive to give them money just to enable the very reasons they can't get jobs and save money for an apartment.

So ought I give to nonprofits and not directly to the poor? I have vicarious trauma from my own experience working in child abuse nonprofits and dealing with extraordinarily toxic, incompetent leadership that directly causes turnover which flagrantly wastes resources and burns out people who haven't left. To say nothing of ridiculous mission-creep activities caused by the ED getting a bug up their butt about something stupid so they hire staff and pay rent on crap no one needs instead of using donations responsibly. So again, seems counterproductive to give donations to these organizations just to have the money be drained into some training for staff that won't be there in two months. In fairness, I don't know this is the case for poverty-based nonprofits, but I don't see why I should trust that they're any different.

And this is petty but I donated to St. Vincent de Paul a few months ago and never received a thank you. I mean. My mom never let me cash a check or play with a toy until a thank you was given. I stopped giving gifts to a couple kids in my life because I never received a thank you. My aunts and grandmother still talk about never receiving thank you notes after wedding or baby showers. And for a nonprofit, this isn't a small thing. I've also worked in nonprofit development, you NEED to thank your donors if you want them to keep donating, that's the bare minimum! And they're Catholic, so I *want* to donate to them again, but being ignored doesn't make me think they're a well-run organization. But Jesus said that if you receive an earthly reward then your good deed means nothing in heaven, so is not receiving a thank you is actually a better thing?

Also also. Homelessness in my area is an overwhelming problem with absolutely no end to how bad it can get. You could almost set fire to wheelbarrows of cash for all the good that pouring money into the problem will do. How do you give money responsibly in a situation like that? Then again, God doesn't care about success he just wants your obedience, so should I just shut up and write checks to the food pantry and not worry about outcomes? But really now, shouldn't we use our resources wisely? I've prayed on this and honestly I think the answer I'm getting is to shut up and write a check for heaven's sake. 

Finally, there's a local bicycle nonprofit that I've worked with for ages, I know it's finances and leadership quite well, but it's not exactly a ""help the poor"" kind of organization. I assume donating to hobby-esque nonprofits like that doesn't count as almsgiving?",Catholicism

God never commanded/allowed the people of the Old Testament to do something immoral,Ambitious_Ad_8339,1624217469,"When asked about difficult Old Testament passages, such as God ordering the genocide of entire peoples, many respond in such a way that it seems that God only tolerated the Jews doing immoral things because they were a brutal people, hard-hearted people.

This is an incorrect way of looking at God's relationship with the people of the Old Testament, because  God CAN'T command/allow a person to do what is immoral, because doing so goes against God's good nature. It doesn't matter if we're talking about Christians, Jews or anything else. Also doesn't matter if God had good intentions by commanding those things, because the ends doesn't justify the means; good intentions do not make an immoral act in something good.

Everything that God commanded/allowed in the these times was simply not immoral. And if God, today, commanded us Catholics to do the same, then doing these things wouldn't be immoral too.

In the case of the killing of innocents, all life simply belongs to God, so he can kill anyone he wants, from criminals to innocents. That's why God occasionally kills innocents in the Bible or command people to kill innocents. It's a matter of authority. I, for example, do not have the authority to execute criminals, declare wars or collect taxes, but my country's government does. Likewise, I cannot kill innocents, but God can.

This is also true for divorce, incest and polygamy. God created marriage and the human sexuality, and it is in His authority to decide how these things can be expressed. Abraham did nothing wrong by marrying his half-sister, King Solomon did nothing wrong by having hundreds of wives and concubines, and the Jews did nothing wrong by divorcing their wives.",Catholicism

Apologies if this isn’t the right place to discuss this, but I’ve encountered a few disconcerting experiences while sleeping that I’d like a fresh set of eyes on. In the past month, I’ve had a couple dreams or intense experiences where I’ve found myself in darkness and constantly praying the Our Father prayer to prevent what felt like an evil presence from coming in. Lately, nothing has troubled me thankfully. But last night, I awoke to a vision of pale smoke in the form of a lady looking over me at my bedside. It freaked me out, because it looked right into me. The lady reached over, and seemed to want to approach me. But given my past dreams and experiences at night, I was afraid and waved the smoke away. The vision disappeared, but its been nagging me as to what it could be. 

Could this just be an example of a hallucination, a demon, or private vision of the Virgin Mary Herself? I didn’t sense any malevolence from the lady, but I did wish to approach me.

"Touching, poignant reflection on fatherhood from the book, “Dan England and the Noonday Devil,” by Myles Connolly",binkknib,1624205872,"Today fatherhood is an heroic calling. The father of olden times was in may ways an idyllic character, living serenely in the bosom of his family, planning and saving for the future. But today he lives in turmoil and toils in vain. If he is industrious, if he is competent, he does not work for his family and the future but for the lazy and incompetent everywhere. 

No longer has his home the peace of the old homestead. His children ride in engines of death and destruction, and the jangling of the telephone in the depth of the night may mean tragedy in the air or on the highway. Disease of the mind born of the madness and artificiality of those modern environment, derange and sometimes destroy those he loves.

More menacing is the increased threat against faith and morals endlessly made by an increasingly arrogant and unbelieving world. More dangerous by far are the soul's diseases (with skepticism and apathy predominating), present always like a plague. Life outside of the monastic walls is perilous, fiercely competitive, often brutal. 

The dedicated father today is a hero, and if you ask why he faces his burdens so bravely, I can answer only because in him is the stuff of saints. Not for him is the consolation of applause. The mother is praised in song and extolled in story. But the father walks the common way without bugles, without drums, with no flags flying. He, truly, has given hostage to fortune. 

Those holy men and women who have given up the world are glorious children of God, but if there were no harassed, slaving poor fathers, there would be none of those glorious children, if for no other reason than they would never have been born. 

Peace of mind and peace of soul are lovely possessions but they are not for the dedicated father. The particular saint in him demands that he go out and meet the challenge of the day, that he be concerned not with his own serenity and well-being but with those in his care, that he venture forth into the world and there, thick in the masses of men, seek the opportunity to love his neighbor and to love his enemy, so that, in advance and not in retreat, in battle and not in seclusion, he may prove himself worthy of Him who has shared with him the divine power of creation. 

The priest may offer his Mass and the nun her sacrifices, and the contemplatives may send up their unceasing assault of prayer and mortification – all may cry out for succor, may plead to stay the hand of Eternal Justice – but it is the father, that undistinguished, yawning man you see in the the early morning leaving home for the shop, the office, the factory, the mine – that tired, troubled person you see returning home at night, often with a smile that is false and a cheerfulness without foundation – it is he who is the first warrior and the first guardian of the Faith. For he is the captain of the home, the citadel on which the Christian civilization is built. 

There is no order or organization to record his heroism or promote his beatification. He is the common, oftentimes inglorious beast of burden, his greatest distinction being the resemblance he bears the the ass that carried Christ.

Anyhow, I started to become frustrated with a lot of things my church and the broader church do/believe. My own church has schisms between the more evangelical Anglican and the Anglo catholics. This lack of cohesion about some of the basics of the faith is concerning to me.

I haven’t been to church in a year and went back for the first time 2 weeks ago, the problems remain the same, the only reason I stuck around is because I get on well with the Father of the church. However he will be leaving this December. 

My questions are - Papal infallibility, this is something I struggle to wrap my head around, and probably comes from my Protestant roots. What are your guys opinions on it? 

Secondly - I am baptised and confirmed Anglican. Do I need to go through this again? Can I take communion straight away?  This is one thing that keeps me erring about it.

"Andy Warhol's Unorthodox, Orthodox Faith",ThrowThisAway2k21,1624189030,"Since it is the month of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Pride month, it is beneficial for Catholics to educate themselves on SSA/LGBT+ Catholics throughout the Church's history. 

Andrew ""Andy"" Warhola (1928-1987) was born into a working-class family in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. He grew up in an observant Ruthenian Greek Catholic household.

Warhol moved to New York City, where he quickly gained notoriety for his distinctive pop style which criticized consumerism. By the 1960s, Warhol had assembled a group of young artists at his Factory, known for its rampant drug use and sex. Warhol's films and art often featured obscene imagery and themes. Whether it is an hours-long still of the Empire State building or a drag-inspired rock group, Warhol was keen on pushing boundaries when he could. 

At the ceremony, historian John Richardson would shock many when he explained the devout faith that Warhol had kept hidden from most near to him. Following an attempted assassination attempt in 1968, Warhol resolved to attend Mass daily. Warhol would often sit at the back of the pews, irregularly receiving communion and often coming in between mass to light candles and silently pray. This renewed faith also led to Warhol financing his nephew's training for the priesthood, volunteering at homeless shelters, and serving at a food pantry on holidays. Warhol would often gossip about Catholic celebrities, such as when he condemned Martin Scorsese for getting a divorce. By Warhol's account and that of Richardson, he remained celibate, although this was disputed by many of the gay men Warhol had relations with. 

Warhol's later artwork became increasingly religious, centering on images of the Madonna, the last supper, and mass-producing images of skulls. Warhol's life and career show the complexity that defined his relationship with his faith. Warhol was the man that put on expensive wigs and photographed and filmed erotic scenes, often for his own voyeuristic desires. Yet he also was the man that humbled himself before Pope John II, the poor, and the Church. His life, contradictory as it may seem, shows how people can live out their faith in unorthodox ways.

Yesterday I learned that Joseph Smith had an accidentally Catholic moment.,coinageFission,1624188400,"Observe this quote from his History of the Church, Volume 6, Chapter 23. Smith records the synopsis of a sermon which he preached on June 16, 1844, concerning the nature of the Godhead. If he had only known the import of some of his words!

&gt; John said he was a king. “And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth. Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God, and His Father; to him be glory and dominion forever and ever Amen.” Oh, Thou God who art King of kings and Lord of lords, the sectarian world, by their actions, declare, “We cannot believe Thee.”
&gt; 
&gt; **The old Catholic church traditions are worth more than all you have said.** Here is a principle of logic that most men have no more sense than to adopt. I will illustrate it by an old apple tree. Here jumps off a branch and says, “I am the true tree, and you are corrupt.” **If the whole tree is corrupt, are not its branches corrupt? If the Catholic religion is a false religion, how can any true religion come out of it? If the Catholic church is bad, how can any good thing come out of it? The character of the old churches have always been slandered by all apostates since the world began.** 
&gt; 
&gt; **I testify again, as the Lord lives, God never will acknowledge any traitors or apostates.** Any man who will betray the Catholics will betray you; and if he will betray me, he will betray you. All men are liars who say they are of the true Church without the revelations of Jesus Christ and the Priesthood of Melchisedek, which is after the order of the Son of God.",Catholicism

Are biblically inspired stories bad/evil?,Buddius-Corgius,1624175316,"I was watching a simple kids story movie on TV and I pointed out how this story was obviously biblically inspired. I mentioned the parallels and whatnot.

My Mom said that it was not that way whatsoever and that the movie was evil in that sense.

I asked how and she said that the movie only leads to hell. I told her that the reason biblically inspired stories aren't bad are because they take inspiration from what is essentially the only guide to Goodness, Paradise, and Salvation and basically teaching a kiddified version or making your own varied fictional metaphor that references biblical stories isn't too bad.

She kept shaking her head, saying no over and over again. She talked about how stories like this are a mockery to biblical stories and if you want biblical message you should just read the Bible.

She isn't a bad person and I'm sure the way she views it may just be her own way towards salvation since my Dad says she's a (long-time) convert.

I'm a cradle-Catholic and I honestly see the world and everything within it to just leading back to the Church one way or another. So honestly I'm just a little stuck on her strictness of it since I don't see the need to blocking these stories out if they won't be able to knock me off the path towards the Church. To me, telling stories like these aren't a problem if you know where you stand in the Church but she says that these stories should be avoided at all costs and they can knock you off your faith if you aren't careful.

Protestant theories on the origin of saint intercessory prayer?,cb9233,1624167344,"While speaking with some Protestant friends of mine, the topic of saint veneration came up. They both admitted that the practice became commonplace fairly early on in Church history - but offered some ‘hypotheses’ on how the practice began; which I am now kindly asking someone to refute and/or make sense of:

1) The Church allowed the incorporation of pagan religious customs (namely the patron-client relationship prominent as a part of ancient Roman relationships with the gods) to attract more followers from the pagans, but also because the bishops were so busy dealing with christological heresies that the ‘pagan’ practice of saint intercessory prayer kind of just fell through the cracks and became a superstitious part of popular piety.

2) Saint veneration is an invention influenced heavily by Neoplatonism. More specifically, the alleged premise of the philisophy which deems God unreachable unless through higher intercessors who are capable/worthy of beseeching him (the Saints, Mary, etc.), so definitely not sinful living human beings.

"Story of Maria Serafina + Martin Luther: Real, or Fabrication?",SpicyLizardWizard,1624167140,"Hey Catholics!

I was reading the history of the Protestant Reformation online, and found a few articles regarding the Bl. Clotile Micheli (a.k.a: Maria Serafina). I came across a thread of articles which stated that she saw a vision of Martin Luther in hell, having a nail hammered through his head by a few demons. I was perplexed, because this story appears neither in her Wikipedia article, nor in Wikipedia's citations. The few websites that *do* include this story seem to be pulling verbatim quotes from each other ([some articles](https://marysarmy742128112.wordpress.com/2020/07/29/blessed-maria-serafina-saw-martin-luther-in-hell/) are literally just copy-pasted variations of [others](https://marysarmy742128112.wordpress.com/2020/07/29/blessed-maria-serafina-saw-martin-luther-in-hell/)). Regardless, does anyone actually know if this story has any verifiable/legitimate attestations? Or is it just a popular fabrication?

Just to clarify: I'm perfectly aware that in the Catholic Church, private revelations do not add to the deposit of faith, and thus their belief isn't required. I'm just really curious as to the veracity of this vision.

I used to have a really cool job and now I’m in between my next career doing more remedial work.  I have found great dignity in all work and it’s been a humbling process (something I really needed).  It’s also been challenging and tested my faith in God (which I have greatly failed).

I can't seem to understand how St Peter did in fact have some level of power over the other apostles,reddpuntoit,1624157391,"Hey all, despite me being rather confident in the one true Catholic Church, I find myself constantly researching the great schism, and the arguments put forth by the Eastern Orthdox.

I am having quite some trouble wrapping my head around whether or not St Peter had any form of authority over the other apostles. Of course, the Orthodox claim this is not the case, and instead insist that the head of their church is God himself. This sounds appealing to me, but then again because of this power structure the orthodox church is very divided. I've also heard some orthodox argue that St James the Less and St Paul were more powerful than St Peter. 

Sorry for rambling, but the uncertainty over the power of St Peter makes me feel slightly skeptical of the authority of the Pope, which makes me feel a little bad about myself for doubting this wonderful church I've grown up with and loved",Catholicism

How did Augustine and Aquinas differ in their interpretation of scripture?,Mimi108,1624154469,"I'm getting quite confused. I understand that Augustine used tropes in order to get the meaning of scripture, which to him, always circles back to God's love for us, if the literal interpretation of the scripture did not spell it out.  

However, with Aquinas, he uses 4 senses, and it all starts from the literal sense, and each sense must be analyzed, until the meaning of God's love for us, is found.  

So, what is truly different about them, in regards to this matter? Is it just the system they use? B/c both of them acknowledge that text can have multiple meanings, it's just that we must push to find the actual meaning of God's love for us.",Catholicism
Advice,Informal-Amphibian-4,1624153481,"It's a sin to give up on community but how do you stay involved and possibly make friends if everyone thinks you're weird, boring and just a loser. People think you're crazy, a burden on society and the church pest because you have a bunch of problems and nothing else to offer. They are not wrong in thinking any of these things. Every time i try to make a friend i never move past the ""Hi how are you?"" stage. Many people avoid me before we even get to that stage. The ones that make small talk distance themselves if i'm anything but perfectly chipper and my life seems anything but perfect. This is all understandable. It used to be that i'd be able to get right past this stage before everyone ghosted me. But always people would ghost me as soon as i started opening up and they started seeing beyond the most surface layer. It turns out people don't like who i actually am. They would prefer me to be a perfectly happy and successful person who doesn't have any problems, who can make them laugh, keep them entertained, be around to help them and provide wise advice or a listening ear when they need it. That seems to be the only way people will accept me. I've also been directly told just as much many times. People who were my ""friends"" would say how nobody liked me because i was weird and they preferred me to not be myself but to be this fake plastic person who is nothing but smiles and cheer. Of course those aren't the exact words but you get the idea. Sometimes it seemed as if their being friends with me was them doing me a favor because they were a good person and felt sorry for me. Most of these ""friends"" turned out to be people who needed things from me and once they didn't need them anymore, they disappeared. Even priests who are initially friendly eventually find me to be an annoying pest even if i never interact with them. If they can't even see me as worthy then who on earth can?

I feel enormous guilt and i'm ashamed of feeling this way and caring, for many reasons. My own advice to myself is to forget myself and my problems and find ways to love and serve others. But the catch is i have no one around me to love and serve, no physical community.

I think the Eucharist is cannibalism and I don't think this is a problem,Ambitious_Ad_8339,1624151697,"Accusations of cannibalism against the Eucharist are not new and a common apologetic answer to this is that the Eucharist is the body of Jesus only in its substance, its accidents being that of a normal bread. But I don't find this answer convincing because you're consuming a human body, the Eucharist is literally the body of Christ, and I don't see why the fact that it's just the substance of a human body makes this morally different. So I prefer to deal with this moral issue in another way:

1- Monsignor Austin Vaughan and Reverend William Smith, professors of theology at St. Joseph Seminary in Yonkers, have stated that ""a person can eat dead human flesh if there is no viable alternative to survival."" Cannibalism in these situations has been compared to a ""heart transplant"" because the heart of a dead person can be removed to keep another alive, and this comparison was considered ""reasonable"" by the two Catholic theologians. ([https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/28/archives/two-catholic-aides-defend-cannibalism-in-chilean-air-crash.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/28/archives/two-catholic-aides-defend-cannibalism-in-chilean-air-crash.html))

A) There really are many similarities between organ transplantation and cannibalism in these situations. You are removing someone's body part, somehow putting it into you body, then your body absorbs that part in the name of the common benefit of your whole body and it becomes part of you.

2- So if you are allowed to eat human flesh in order to save your life, then you are also allowed to consume the Eucharist because it is the source of the Christian life (John 6:53-54, Paragraph 1324 and 1325 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church).",Catholicism

I am familiar that in Judea 2000 years ago, people passed down scripture orally because most of them couldn't read or write. People were very concerned about preserving texts, and I trust early Christians did the same. Not to mention the thousands of manuscripts that exist, with most differences just spelling mistakes.

So here my problem, I learned that the story of the adulterous woman was said by scholars false, because the earliest manuscripts we have don't mention it.

I really want to go through RCIA or do something to make up for the fact that I've had no sacraments since my first communion. I missed out on the experience of confirmation. After my communion, my mom, who never really was someone who went to church much, stopped taking me to religious classes at the local church and so I fell out of everything. 

Well, I would just sign up for it this year and get it over with. However, I'll be leaving the country from January to June, meaning I would only really get a couple months of RCIA classes, missing the bulk of it and the most important part at Easter. 

I'm wondering what my actual options are. There's no way I can do the actual RCIA course as far as I'm aware, but it doesn't seem reasonable to just put everything off for another year.",Catholicism

"Anyone know any intelligent, honest, and reliable youtubers, website creators, authors or other people that would help me win debates against atheists, satanists, and pagans?",GuiltyAnimalLover,1624130682,"I'm tired of being afraid of losing debates since I take pride in intelligence and am very afraid to look foolish in front of others. This post in quotes provided from another subreddit explains why I'm so anxious to win debates. 

It would be nice if you read my post before commenting, but you don't have to 

Here is what my post said: 

""My heart physically hurts whenever I hear someone blaspheme or say heresies. I am too concerned with how to win debates and I am unable to accept looking like a fool to the atheists.

Anytime I hear an atheist start to blaspheme or argue my heart physically hurts. I have to fight the feeling or else I fall into depression and nihilism. This happens almost every single time I hear an atheist speak or anytime I see something written by an atheist. Anyone else feel the pain? What am I supposed to do to keep fighting? I wonder if the atheists and satanists are right about God. What is God isn't great after all? What if God isn't worth loving and serving? What if the devil is more righteous than God? What if there is no heaven, angels, or saints? They seem to have a huge advantage over me since I barely know any theology so it's hard for me to fight back with the facts. I have sworn to God to try to keep loving him no matter what despite what anyone may say, but it can be painful and tiresome at times to keep fighting. I'm not going to stop trying to love God even if it hurts. I will keep having faith and I will keep learning about the lives of the saints and about the teachings of Jesus and the doctors of the church. Hopefully someday I will be a strong enough opponent to be able to beat the atheists and satanists in debates. But for now, I have no good choice but to endure with mostly just faith, hope, and love. If anyone feels similar, I hope you know you are not alone and I am going through this with you. Let's get though this together. Thanks for any help. :)""

This is why I want to be a better and more knowledgeable debater. Can anybody help me? I don't want to just be a bible-thumper going by blind faith anymore.

Communion more than twice in a day,Cordelia_Fitzgerald,1624127358,"I’m not being scrupulous or anything, more curious, but I’m in a unique situation today and I’m wondering what you all think.

Canon law says that a person can receive Communion twice in one day, as long as the second time is within the context of a Mass.

I went to a retreat this morning where we had a Communion service with a lay brother around 9am.  Then around 1pm as we were cleaning up, Brother had me help him consume some of the reserved consecrated Hosts so he didn’t have them bring them back with us in the car.

Does that count as a second time receiving Communion in one day, or does it count as the same reception since I was helping Brother clean up from our Communion service?  If it does count, does that mean I shouldn’t receive at the vigil Mass this evening?

&gt;It firmly believes, professes, and teaches that the matter pertaining to the law of the Old Testament, of the Mosaic law, which are divided into ceremonies, sacred rites, sacrifices, and sacraments, because they were established to signify something in the future, although they were suited to the divine worship at that time, after our Lord’s coming had been signified by them, ceased, and the sacraments of the New Testament began; and that whoever, even after the passion, placed hope in these matters of the law and submitted himself to them as necessary for salvation, as if faith in Christ could not save without them, sinned mortally. Yet it does not deny that after the passion of Christ up to the promulgation of the Gospel they could have been observed until they were believed to be in no way necessary for salvation; but after the promulgation of the Gospel it asserts that they cannot be observed without the loss of eternal salvation. All, therefore, who after that time observe circumcision and the Sabbath and the other requirements of the law, it declares alien to the Christian faith and not in the least fit to participate in eternal salvation, unless someday they recover from these errors.

To my understanding JPII's opinion was exemplified in Nostra Aetate

&gt;As Holy Scripture testifies, Jerusalem did not recognize the time of her visitation,(9) nor did the Jews in large number, accept the Gospel; indeed not a few opposed its spreading.(10) Nevertheless, God holds the Jews most dear for the sake of their Fathers; He does not repent of the gifts He makes or of the calls He issues-such is the witness of the Apostle.(11) In company with the Prophets and the same Apostle, the Church awaits that day, known to God alone, on which all peoples will address the Lord in a single voice and ""serve him shoulder to shoulder"" (Soph. 3:9).(12)",Catholicism

|Belle leaves to be with her father, but she returns|Christ left to be with his father, but He shall return|

Anyways I am trying to start practicing my faith again but it is so hard to sincerely believe in God like I used to. I strongly believe in Evolution and I prefer to explore and exhaust all psychological and scientific phenomenons before I come to a spiritual or theological conclusion. Basically I try to rationalize things as much as I can before I credit the supernatural.  When I was an atheist, I believed that due to our evolutionary nature, all human beings are equivalent in value to animals. I believed that the existence of human kind was conceived by a mere chance and that my life or the lives of other humans were no more valuable to a cow or dog's life. I believed things such as love, relationships, family, ect were all institutions and beliefs fabricated by humans in order to better fare about in this cruel and cold world. I believed that life itself, including my own was meaningless and without purpose. My only incentive to live was to pass on my genes and enjoy my life while I had it. This kind of thinking has left it's mark on me. I used to love people and value them as God's children, but now I can not help but see them( including myself) as a mere, highly evolved animal. Essentially I believed that because of the fact that we evolved from animals, that we were no different than animals, thus making life meaningless and death; a mundane albeit natural conclusion to human life.

The Catholic Church Has Cancer,GregorianChant007,1624087122,"Now please take a bit of time to hear me out, because I love the Church.

There has been a trend lately that if someone in the Church has done something very wrong and evil, the Catholic Church is then seen as evil. (Think Cardinal Mccarrick, Pennsylvania abuse scandal, or Canadian residential schools, for instance).
What we forget though, is that the Church is a body, not just an institution. So I propose an analogy that I think sheds light on the matter. The Church is a body, and that body has cancer.

Cancer is when some cells within a body turn to their own set of rules, and as a result harm the good of the body itself. This does not mean the body itself is bad, just as you wouldn't say someone with cancer is bad. But the body of the Church is ill. It needs the cancer to be rooted out, and the body to be strengthened in order for the good to operate freely.

This is perhaps a radical shift from what you will see in the opinions of most popular media in our age. They will generally portray the Church itself as the problem, rather than some cells of that Church that need to be rooted out. I believe that these opinions are only harming what is still good in the Church. We need a radical mind shift.

Please pray for the Church. She needs our prayers now as always. May we humbly submit ourselves to the will of God, and grow close to Him so we can be healed. May he truly be the Heart of His Body.


(Disclaimer) this analogy is not my own creation. It's from a homily of a priest that I know well and trust. He puts all of his Sunday homilies out on most podcast sources, as well as Facebook, under the name ""A Beggar's Heart"". If you want a link to the specific video where he makes this analogy, please pm me and I'd be happy to provide it.",Catholicism

Church implosion right on schedule [Article],domesticenginerd_,1624079613,"Hi r/Catholicism!

I stumbled upon this post and it’s sensational title caught my eye. But as I dove in, I really enjoyed what it had to say and it inspires a lot of hope!

I wanted to share. What do y’all think? How do you feel about the changes? (Do you perceive the changes or does it seem similar to your prior experiences?) What are you doing to support our church and its leaders (particularly the Pope) as he guides us for the future?

An excerpt:

&gt; Nearly nine years, I spoke… about the Vatican implosion and, as a result, the long and gradual collapse of the Catholic Church's monarchical structure of governance and ministry.

&gt; I argued that as the last absolute monarchy in the West (and almost anywhere else in the world) the organization of the Roman Church has become an anachronism. It made sense when monarchies were a fundamental feature of human society. But no longer. This outdated model of the Catholic Church's structure no longer incarnates the reality of the lived experience of believers…

&gt; Even despite the *kairos* – the special, providential moment – that many Catholics believe we've been experiencing since the election of the first-ever Jesuit pope, the Church continues to implode.In fact, in some ways, Francis seems to be deliberately hastening its inevitable collapse by implementing the principles and methods outlined in *Evangelii gaudium* (EG), his vision and blueprint for Church renewal and reform. 

&gt; Let's be clear, we're not talking about the demise of the Catholic Church.  God is not dead and the Holy Spirit will never leave Christ's faithful people. This we all believe. No, it's about the crumbling of the present governing and organizational structure, which continues to mirror certain features of the Roman Empire more than it reflects the organizational model of ecclesial life that is found in the New Testament or was experienced in the first couple of centuries of the Christian Church.

&gt; Francis is effectively laying the foundation for the deconstruction of the current model by patiently planting the seeds for the Church's structural conversion by baptizing and employing four, key sociological principles (EG 222-237):

&gt; - Time is greater than space
&gt; - Unity prevails over conflict
&gt; - Realities are more important than ideas
&gt; - The whole is greater than the partsUltimately the pope's goal is to make the structures and mentality of the Church more reflective of the Gospel and person of Jesus Christ and to liberate it from a codified system of rules and philosophical ideas still deeply wedded to the culture of the ancient Greco-Roman world.

Emptiness.,Affectionate-Feed759,1624076877,"One night in the deepest depression mixed with fatigue and desperation, needing to put this feeling in a way everybody could understand I wrote this.

---------------------------------------

Lying still in the coffin, there she was. Superb in beauty, incomparable in her inner strength. She was taken from me; so many beautiful, meaningful years we were together. Life was a promise that shined in every new day's beginning with her giving me all I needed to get out and conquer the world. She whispered into my thoughts and I shivered in excitement, at night we used to dream about our final destination, our heaven for which we struggled hand in hand. 

Now she is gone,  I see her in her coffin as my heart wants to stop beating, my eyes seeing, my tongue speaking. 

She died of fatigue, she died in pain that I felt as sorrow howling from my deepest; the unknown depths of her roots in me. 

We were one. Now, I am nothing. 

Defeated, broken, I still see her in my coffin.

Why did I allow her to starve to a slow death?

Her voice got quieter with time but her smile made me blind.

It was me who slowly killed her.

It was me.

And she lies in my coffin, cold, motionless, never meaningless.

My coffin still beats. What for?

Ripped away with her roots my own meaning was dead. 

I called her Faith.

My hope was lost.

An undesired visitor.,Affectionate-Feed759,1624076280,"If you are easily impressed avoid reading this.




The city was strangely empty, not a single person was seen in windows or the street, not a single car on the road or parked. The sun shined bright as a few clouds slowly moved while their image reflected in the glass of the higher buildings. In this forest of concrete with tall skyscrapers in every corner we could easily hide from the creature chasing us. I knew if it caught us our death would have been slow and painful. I had to protect my wife and son who had no idea we were being hunted by this dragon, my fear had to be hidden as my anxiety to move faster, they still didn't know. On the mirror of the convertible I could see its sinister image flying and stopping at the roofs of the skyscrapers looking, hunting. I remembered an underground parking place to the left. It was a tunnel where I could move forward or backward, I also knew it could be a trap but the beast was getting closer. My fear and desperation were only hidden because I knew I could manage the situation saving us from the teeth and claws that wanted to tear us in pieces. Quickly turned the heavy car left and drove to the parking, stopping right in the middle of it to move in any direction when needed, turned engine off and listened. The quietness was maybe a sign it was not close, or waiting on the other side ready to give the first blow. I looked into the mirror and the front. Strangely not one single word was spoken, we sat quiet. After some time, few minutes, I decided to drive out as fast as I could. Turned engine on and drove full throttle forward, into the road under the trees that could take us far from the beast.


I felt the hand of my wife pressing mine as I woke up from the dream and her body was shacking pressed against me, the angry growling of the dog was strange as it walked slowly out to of the room and looked at the stairs.

""Are you okay?"" she asked.

""I had a bizarre dream where a dragon wanted to kill us, something strange almost like a nightmare but somehow I knew I could manage the situation. What is wrong with the dog? Shut up! Shhhhhh!"" I said loud and the dog walked to his bed, still growling from time to time.

""Why are you pressing my hand? The shacking? What is wrong with you?"".


She took a few seconds to calm down.

""You didn't hear the voice?"" She asked looking into my eyes with fear.


""What voice? No, I heard no voice, I was busy with my dream.""


""I was woken by the dog and saw a dark silhouette moving towards you, I grabbed your hand and got closer to you. I couldn't speak but the figure got close to your ear and whispered something I couldn't understand, it was in a weird language, I felt you were in great danger, maybe all of us.""


""What?"", I asked anxious, ""what silhouette? How was it? Are you ok?""


""It was very tall, with a dark robe, the face I could not see, it moved slowly, the dog saw that too as it was growling looking at it. It was horrible! I was so afraid, I wanted to wake you up but I couldn't talk, my voice didn't come and I also could not move so I grabbed your hand and got as close as I could."" She said in fear with tears in her eyes. ""I felt this thing was threatening you, a great difficult test will come for you or us, you believe we will be fine?""


""I think so, in my dream I was confident somehow, I hope it is related, are you sure you saw that?""


""Love"" she said hugging me, ""why did the dog react like that? Sure I saw it, it walked out of the room and down the stairs, the dog followed it! It was horrible! You don't remember the whispering in your ear? Do you remember something? What language was it? Never heard it.""


We talked about our visitor for a few minutes more and slept again, hugged this time.

Indeed times are getting difficult from time to time and it seems the tempest is still to come. We have never had visitors again but sometimes take a look at the stairs.

About that night, still some details she does not want to tell me as every time I ask she says she does not want to remember any more that figure.

Serious question (and arguably a rant): why does traditionalism correlate with adherence to conspiracy theories and antiscientific beliefs?,dhammapada186,1624071358,"The polemical title is completely unintended, but I don't think there's a softer way to put it. Yes, I know it's a kind of loaded question, but I don't believe its premise is open to discussion. It's just an observation. I'm sorry if this offends anyone, but I'm just stating what I saw.

In my experience dealing with trads I've come across people believing all kinds of conspiracy theories and falling into antiscientific thinking, ranging from sedevacantists, antivaxxers and Holocaust deniers to Young Earth creationists and people who actually believe there is no COVID-19 and we're living with restrictions for no reason other than societal control.

The question is: Why is this the case? My intuition tells me that in the endeavor of fighting ""modernism"" (which is always more denounced than defined) they tend to reject various aspects of modernity without going to the extreme of falling prey to an Amish mindset. They experience a tension with the modern world that remains unresolved, and it manifests itself as conspiracy theories that offer alternative explanations to current events.",Catholicism

However, my ex fiance gave me an ultimatum, marry me or I will go into seminary to be a priest.  I was shocked &amp; devastated because a sacred vow to serve God is for life and we can never get married, which is another sacred vow. .  My heart was shattered and I felt great isolation &amp; betrayal when he left 4 seminary. I had noclosure.

My human nature felt cheated because I loved him b4 becoming a priest vs. Falling 4 a priest.  I know he loved me too till day he went to seminary. 

  My ex went to seminary for many years &amp; a priest for 9 years now.  I haven't seen him  in 15 years.  Looking back,, i believed him becoming a priest was a gift from God to him and me.

I did not attend his ordination,  it was too painful &amp; once he took his vows, God helped me, in time, to understand his will for both of us and my heart was teuly full of gratitude that he became a priest.

I must surrender all of this to the will of God.  I know nothing but God knows everything.  This news is so sad and crazy,  WHY WHY would he leave the priesthood?  I stay awake at night thinking a million reasons as satan plays with my head.  Than I pray and the Holy Spirit tells me give it all to God, his will is the only answer.

I think my dear brother has apostatized...,PeterpatchCounty,1624070118,"My only brother and I have a wide age gap (12 years). He moved out of our parent's home about a decade ago now, has married (a protestant) and has a lovely daughter of whom I am proud to be her Godfather. When he lived with us he was a fairly active participant in our parish community; serving as a lector, being part of the Youth group, attending every Sunday, and he continued this for a while after he left. He was even part of his local parish council until recently. Last year he moved to another city with his family during the pandemic and he has not been to (or even watched) Mass in at least 15 months. Now, Churches have been closed for Sunday Mass on and off in our region of Canada but they have been very much open for longer than they were closed.

My parents (and I) are quite upset about this. My Mom confronted him about it today on the phone and he declared that ""going back to church is not a priority for him"" and that ""the Catholic Church is corrupt,"" He listed off a number of disagreements that he had with the Church including women priests, LGBTQ+ acceptance, and some others that I do not remember at this moment. He also listed the crimes against Indigenous Children in Canada ([Residential Schools](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57325653)), the sexual abuse scandals, and corruption within the hierarchy as reasons for not returning. 

He continued to say that he still believes in Jesus (I have no reason to doubt him but somehow I do), and that he is still a member of the Catholic Church but that there are ""other churches that reflect Jesus's teachings better.""

In any case, I feel terribly for my brother, whose eternal soul is at stake as well as for my dear niece (2y) who will most likely grow up without knowing Christ. My brother claims that she won't even remember Jesus nowadays (which I don't think is true, young children are sponges for knowledge).

2) From my understanding you guys put equal emphasis on tradition AND scripture (correct me if I’m wrong 😊) so are these traditions that have been passed down through the ages?

4) How did thé tradition of praying to saints come about?

5) In the churches I have attended, communion has always been symbolic. My understanding though is that Catholics believe in it being the actual body and blood of Christ (transubstantiation). Could you explain why you believe that?

There are several theories regarding the meaning of the 153 fish. My favorite one is that this passage is prophetic and connected to Jesus' apparition to 500 people before his Ascension. So out of the 500 witnesses, 153 converted. Why less than one third? many reasons probably. Some fell in the 'even if the dead came back to life they would not believe' category.

At what point does tolerating sinful behavior become sin of scandal?,6christian,1624063609,"Hi Everyone,

I have learned about the sin of scandal in the last year. It has been really eye opening for me to realize that so many of my actions could potentially lead others to sin or tempt them to. In particular to this question I am focusing on how going along with something that is sinful is scandal in that you are to some extent indicating to others that sinful actions are acceptable.

 At what point does our acceptance of sinful behavior or conduct become the sin of scandal?

For example, what if I am with a group of friends at a small party and they begin gossiping hard about someone we all know. Even if I don't join in, would my silence be sin of scandal in that I am making it seem like there is nothing wrong with their gossiping? 

Or for another example, let's say that I am with a friend and they blatantly lie to someone else to get something they want and I know they are lying. Their lie doesnt affect me and doesnt negatively affect the person they lied to, but would my silence at their lying be sin of scandal in that I am making it seem like it is okay by not saying anything?

I could think of a bunch more examples, but what is everyone's thoughts on this?

"My marriage is really weighing one me. I left the church 10 years ago and want to come back, the problem is my husband and I have huge religious differences and I'm not sure I want to compromise on this.",89TacoCat98,1624041189,"So long story short- I'd been catholic all my life, catholic school/college. Ended up pregnant at 18... get along well with his dad, they are very catholic and have made sure my son recives all his sacrements). I had a hard time when I was pregnant, swore off the catholic church. Became borderline atheist, married and athiest/Mormon man, we now have a child of our own.

 A few years ago I returned to church, and we ended up compromising on a protestant church which I really do like. I enjoy the people, musci, and services. However the more I look back into the catholic faith through podcasts, reading, going to weekly mass... the more i want to go back and to put my kids in the catholic school. 

The other issue is my husband. We have our issues but overall he is a good man, great father, good husband. We've had ups and downs, periods of it being very dark and other times where it is wonderful. Our biggest issues aside from religion is he has become very involved in his own needs and views rather than what is best for the family (doesn't want me or the kids going with friends/family because it takes away from his time with us, doesn't like when I text friends, doesn't like when I let my ex have extra time with his dad... little things). 

Then religion. This is why I'm posting on the catholic sub. I told him that we say we are Christians but don't know much about the faith if someone were to ask us. I asked if we could go through the Bible in a year podcast as a family. He agreed. It was great. 

Then came the issue. In front of the kids, and my bio son (who considers himself very catholic) that the. 
-
catholic faith is old and robotic.
-
 the Bible could be written by Satan and we are just following it blindly.

- we need to question everything in it rather than just accept God's word with Faith.

- that my son and I need to learn to question our faith and accept that there is no ""right religion"", we just need to learn to be kind people. 

- That I should be able to explain why God doesn't talk about dinosaurs. 

It went on for two hours like that. I get he has questions, our pasture keeps inviting him to Bible study and he keeps saying no. I've asked him to go, ask these questions because I'm still trying to figure out my faith as well. And to not ruin the faith of our children. He responded by saying we need to learn to be inquisitive and not just accept God as is. 

I'm frustrated. It's almost become a deal breaker. I don't want to ask for a divorce over this (we do have other issues), but at the same time I want to not ruin my kids faith and religion.

Gossip versus normal human conversation,emptyyellowbowl,1624037992,"I am a bit scrupulous when it comes to gossip/talking about people, and I'd like to talk it through a bit. This pdf has helped me understand rash judgment, detraction, and calumny, but the devil, as it were, is in the details.

https://scrupulousanonymous.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SA_0812.pdf

I live far away from my family, so when I talk to one of them, I ask how the other is doing and we'll talk about the other person for a while and what they ought to do and why they aren't doing it and remember when they did this one thing and how they never learn, etc. 

While this obviously doesn't seem respectful, it does seem human. Like, everyone is old enough to know that they have personality quirks and annoyances and that people will want to vent about them. I don't *think* their reputation is being harmed necessarily. I've tried to avoid asking how other family are doing so I can avoid the near occasion of sin, and after a month it felt like my relationships were weakened and superficial. I concluded that talking about their relationships with other people is a form of intimacy and vulnerability and without asking/sharing that information, our own relationship became shallow.

To take that further, if I have a family member struggling with depression and suicidal ideation and despair and all the poor choices that go with it - promiscuity, drug use, bad relationships - and a close friend asks me how this family member is doing, is it detraction or harming their reputation to answer honestly and to express my frustration with that family member? 

Another specific situation that's bothering me is as follows. 

I have two former co-workers. I was super close with Abby but we naturally drifted apart, though occasionally we'll reach out with a text. I wasn't close with Cynthia, nothing personal. Abby and Cynthia were close. I was at a park and saw Cynthia not wearing her wedding ring. I texted Abby to tell her and said it's not that surprising because her marriage seemed shaky and the pandemic rocked everyone pretty hard. Abby texted back with shock, and then a few minutes later Abby sent a screenshot from IG showing Cynthia with her husband. I responded that social media is fake and the lack of wedding ring is real, but either way, I hope Cynthia's marriage is good.

I had two motives, the first was definitely a feeling of ""oh my goodness how scandalous I need to tell Abby!"" I paused to reflect on whether this was a sin and decided that since Abby would want to know how Cynthia was doing and since I hadn't messaged Abby in a while anyway and since I'm really sad for Cynthia, it falls under ""normal human conversation.""

I will of course find the parish in my new area that feels most right, and I will get involved there . However as a young 20’s guy I am hoping to find a group of younger men/women as well. What’s the best place to make these connections? How can I find a bible study group for men on the younger side? Any other recommendations?

Thank you and God bless.",Catholicism

Often after someone's passing solace is offered by saying they are looking down on you smiling now.

This doesn't take into account purgatory or the fact we have no idea whether someone is in Heaven and Hell. I recall the Church getting backlash for their refusal to certify Hitler was definitely in Hell.

Also I read something on here not to long ago about a Time Paradox. How after death you immediately wake to Heaven, being unconscious all those many years before the Rapture and The Final Judgment, eventual Heaven on Earth where we return to our flesh. 

My education comes from Primary School, my imagination of hell coming from Dante's Inferno. So bare with me please. I presume Judas is not frozen in a block of ice in the final ring of hell, the wing of Betrayal. Can the Church comfortable certify he is in hell when they can't with Hitler. I saw the play and eventual the movies of Jesus Christ Superstar (and while yes I know this isn't canon lol) it paints Judas in a terribly sympathetic light. I've read that certain sects believe Judas held the burden of performing a necessary evil to set the dominos in affect to lead to All of Mankinds Salvation. (I read that some believe all souls before that time, no matter how pure, missed the ticket to Heaven. Meaning Abraham, Moses, David etc. which is absurd.)

Hell is Eternal Suffering as made clear but in the end when God vanquished Hell it is no more? Is the eternal aspect that they will forever be separated from God?  That is the concept in the first place but they are conscious about it which facilitates the suffering.",Catholicism

Pope Francis' teaching on the death penalty made justice something immoral and it is inherently unfair,Ambitious_Ad_8339,1624031208,"If his teaching is to be understand that the death penalty can only be used if there is no other way to protect society from a specific criminal, then if the protection of society is above the punishment a criminal deserves to suffer for his crimes against society, then not only is immoral to kill a criminal who killed thousands of people, but is also immoral to sentence that criminal to 1 year in jail if he sincerely regret what he did and so stop being a threat to society. Both of these ideas are a direct attack on the concept of justice, because a criminal can never receive a punishment proportional to his crime if he is not dangerous to society anymore. The penal system is reduced to a mere instrument to protect society from aggressors; the idea that evil simply deserve to be punished, to suffer, is pretty much abolished, and consequently justice.

And this is not the only thing that makes Pope Francis' teaching unjustly.  The very idea that we should kill a person who MAY commit crimes in the future is immoral; it is unfair to kill someone for crimes that he never committed. This is similar to aborting fetuses of a certain ethnicity because they have a significant chance of committing crimes in the future.  This issue gets worse if you remember that, unless God gives you visions of the future, THERE IS NO WAY to know if a person will actually commit  crimes in the future; you are possibly killing someone who would not even commit crimes in the future.

Even the idea of ​​leaving someone in prison just because of crimes he might commit in the future is inherently unfair, so that's why the penal system cannot be treated as a mere instrument to protect society; retributive justice cannot be removed.

It is worth remembering that there are no inescapable prisons. There is always the possibility that alternative methods to the death penalty will fail to protect society and this is another aspect that makes the pope's teaching flawed.",Catholicism

In my case, I was never baptized or confirmed in an Anglican parish, but rather, I grew up attending a Methodist church with my grandparents and spent some time in military Anglican services as an adult. Does long-term attendance itself meet the requirement?

Right now, I'm an RCIA dropout. To put it simply, I didn't believe their Catholicism -- they were advocating for women priests and at that point, I had a crisis of conscience and saw Catholicism as just as much in deep water as Protestantism.

How do you reconcile Ananias and Sapphira being struck dead?,F1SC,1624026144,"I am Catholic and a believer however this is one New Testament passage that really troubles me and I greatly struggle with. I have heard the arguments but it doesn't make sense in context of the New Covenant. (Acts 5:1-13)

\-Ananias and Sapphira are struck dead for lying to the Holy Spirit for saying they had  given ALL their property proceeds to the early church but had given a portion.

\-This was however AFTER Jesus had died for the forgiveness of sins.

\-One would assume even offering 50%, 70% or 80% of a PROPERTY sale would be hugely useful to the early church and is still a huge sign of faith!

\-This is what gets me most, Peter himself, DENIED and LIED about knowing Jesus (God) 3 times in a row BEFORE Jesus had died for the forgiveness of sins and was not struck dead, but made Ananias and Sapphira look like they had committed the worst sin in the world before falling dead in front of him?

To quote the post itself on Plunkett's life, 

""Joseph Mary Plunkett is mostly known for his involvement in the 1916 Easter Rising and his constant crusade for Irish independence. Nevertheless, he was also an accomplished poet and journalist. He came from a wealthy and privileged family, but he eventually caught a passion for Irish nationalism that was to determine the course of his short life.

After joining the ranks of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, he became embroiled in negotiations for Irish freedom, which ultimately led to the planning of the Easter Rising—an armed insurrection. Plunkett was instrumental in planning this uprising, and it was largely his plan that was followed. After the rebellion was crushed, Plunkett was imprisoned. He was executed by firing squad on May 4, 1916 at the age of 28. While remembered as a revolutionary, Joseph Plunkett left a legacy of incredibly stirring poetry, which I highly recommend you read further.""







*I See His Blood Upon The Rose* 


I see his blood upon the rose

And in the stars the glory of his eyes,

His body gleams amid eternal snows,

His tears fall from the skies.

I see his face in every flower;

The thunder and the singing of the birds

Are but his voice—and carven by his power

Rocks are his written words.


All pathways by his feet are worn,

His strong heart stirs the ever-beating sea,

His crown of thorns is twined with every thorn,

His cross is every tree.",Catholicism

"The twisted ""killing baptized babies"" argument.",dapippo,1624013320,"An atheist once said,

&gt;""There is also a loophole in the Catholic Church. Since they believe in heaven, wouldn't it be better for parents to kill their validly baptized babies right after they were baptized? If Catholic parents truly love their babies, they would sacrifice their own salvation just to ensure that their babies are saved by killing them after a valid baptism.""

&amp;#x200B;

My response to him was,

&gt;You forgot that the purpose of a Christian is not just to be saved, but also to lead others to Christ and build up his fellow believers through his good works. If you kill a Christian, how can he lead others to Christ or strengthen his fellow believers? ***So if you kill one baptized infant, you snuff out one of the lights of the world, which could leave even more people in darkness and in the road to hell.*** Remember that parents are not called only to love their babies, but also to love others!  
&gt;  
&gt;Think about what happens if every baptized infant in the world is killed. That means that there will be no next generation for the Church Militant. The Church Militant itself would end if parents choose to do that.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the Church, which is the light of the world, is gone from the face of the earth, the world will be left in darkness.

A Reflection on Catholicism and Kanye West,CosmicGadfly,1623999400,"On the feast day of Christ the King in 2019, I sat down with some Catholic Workers and other Christians living in intentional community, to have a listening party for Kanye West’s album [“Jesus is King,”](https://open.spotify.com/album/0FgZKfoU2Br5sHOfvZKTI9) which was released almost exactly a month beforehand on October 25th. The years since have seen Kanye gain a lot of new fans from religious circles that once shunned him, especially among the Catholic Church. My frustration in all this has been regarding the commentary about how he’s amended his ways and become a Christian. As if he wasn’t always a Christian. As if he didn’t spend his entire life as an artist exploring his relationship with God, his struggle with sin, and the road to redemption. 

This journey of theodicy has been evident since College Dropout’s sampling of Gospel spirituals such as [“I’ll Fly Away”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psb2dFToHLA&amp;ab_channel=KanyeWest-Topic), and its most infamous track [“Jesus Walks”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g&amp;ab_channel=KanyeWestVEVO). But it’s his most controversial album, [Yeezus](https://genius.com/albums/Kanye-west/Yeezus), that actually captures Kanye’s wrestling with God on the mountain most completely, if not the most clearly. And almost as if anticipating its misrepresentation, Kanye firmly contextualized the record through the eponymous Yeezus Tour, which explored the album interspersed with other tracks from his discography in an explicit 5 Act structure accompanied by narration, performance art and religious iconography. Scenes from this tour of the virgin Mary and Jesus were tweeted and shared by Catholic social media accounts celebrating Kanye’s aforementioned ‘conversion’ when he released “Jesus is King.” These images, ironically, were from a tour he’d done nearly half a dozen years prior, at the height his notoriety as a degenerate egomaniac, which featured published tracks titled as jarringly as “I Am a God.” 

Even before “Jesus is King” dropped, I recall in those days on Weird Catholic Twitter there was a small and lowly account with a bio that read something like “Catholic integralism with Yeezy characteristics.” I appreciated that account and its circles then, which served as a sign to me that the moral complexity of art does not as often escape my fellow Catholics as I’ve frequently seen, even amidst venn diagrams as paradoxical as the intersection between Hip Hop and Traditional Catholic Politics that such an absurd epithet conjures: the Yeezy Integralist.. 

In reflecting on how to succinctly communicate this in the last week, I determined to offer as a summary [this concluding episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2fmlLoqszZntVkKtQV7lQM?si=iLdMeNVEStSB3k4VJvm8kg&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;dl_branch=1) from Season 8 of Dissect. The podcast’s season that dissected the aforementioned “Yeezus” album in its entirety analyzed as its capstone [the Yeezus Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSAK8KHhD6w) itself, and how the performance further contextualizes the album and confirms much of the analysis in the preceding 11 episodes. I urge anyone interested in hearing out the contradictory allure of figures like Kanye West for the Traditionalist Catholic to give a sincere, good faith listen to this wrap-up episode, as the first half walks you through Kanye’s stage performance of [the Yeezus Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSAK8KHhD6w), which finds its inspiration in the stories of King David and Dante’s Divine Comedy. 

For further thought on the confluence of serious religion and hip hop, I recommend the article [“I’ll Write til I’m Right With God”](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2015/08/ill-write-til-im-right-with-god-2) on First Things about Kendrick Lamar. Kendrick’s track [“How Much A Dollar Cost”](https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-how-much-a-dollar-cost-lyrics) from his second published album is in my view the most profound moral reflection from a Christian musician in any art form over the last half-century, especially to achieve popular appeal. Perhaps even the most original Catholic insight to enter mainstream consciousness since Flannery O’Connor’s fiction, unless one counts Martin Scorsese’s flop rendition of [Silence](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/silence-2016). Yet Kendrick, of course, is no Catholic, despite echoing some of our greatest saints, ever ancient, ever new, such as [SoG Dorothy Day](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/road-peace/dorothy-day-and-revolution-love), cofounder of the Catholic Worker Movement, and [St. John Chrysostom](http://liberlocorumcommunium.blogspot.com/2015/04/if-you-cannot-find-christ-in-beggar-at.html), patriarch of Constantinople.

For those interested in the sheer sonic joy that Kanye’s Gospel shenanigans have inspired over the years, look no further than his protege Chance the Rapper. His genre of rap has been classified as [Utopia Rap](https://blavity.com/black-joy-matters-chance-the-rapper-and-the-importance-of-utopia-rap/black-joy-matters-chance-the-rapper-and-the-importance-of-utopia-rap?category1=music) by some. A few excellent records which exemplify his genuine adoption of religious motif and spiritual joy include [“How Great”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1kupzUz_pc&amp;ab_channel=ChanceTheRapper-Topic), [“Blessings”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdpGJSe44_o&amp;ab_channel=ChanceTheRapperChanceTheRapperOfficialArtistChannel), [“Somewhere in Paradise”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7hB1I_elys&amp;ab_channel=SchoolNightsSchoolNights), [“Angels”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eedeXTWZUn8&amp;ab_channel=ChanceTheRapperChanceTheRapper), [“Finish Line / Drown”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAAKG57ouyM&amp;ab_channel=FlawlessMediaFlawlessMedia), [“All We Got”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDAkWJgTSOk&amp;ab_channel=ChanceTheRapperChanceTheRapper), and his awesome feature from [the opening track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5njh9Dkcvwc&amp;ab_channel=BeatsLyricalBeatsLyrical)

"Has anyone else been through this? If so, may I please have some advice?",swells2040,1623994059,"Hi everyone! I don’t really know how to start this post so I’ll just get right into it. I am in the habit of praying right before bed, and the last thing I do before going to sleep is say a St. Michael prayer. However, I struggle with OCD, and so I notice that if I don’t recite the prayer perfectly (according to my standards anyway), I have to go back and repeat the prayer. This isn’t so much an issue with remembering how the prayer goes (I’ve been saying it ever since I was a little kid), but more due to the fact that I have associated different images to different parts of the prayer. If I do not perfectly imagine one of these images during that part of the prayer, I have to start from the beginning. I know this sounds ridiculous, and I know that it is, but I just cannot seem to help myself. If I don’t go back and start from scratch, I feel that I have somehow done the prayer incorrectly and become anxious because I have not prayed properly. I also worry that I am not protected from the devil if the prayer isn’t perfect. 

Additionally, even if I have said the prayer well, sometimes I get an unpleasant image or just a bad feeling as I am falling asleep, and think I have to go back and say the prayer again. 

Now I know that none of this sounds too bad, but lately it has gotten out of hand. Last night alone I spent 20-30 minutes just trying to say a St. Michael prayer that lives up to my expectations. And it seems to get longer each night. I also feel like this repetition and need to have everything perfect distracts from the true reason I am saying the St. Michael prayer. I was just wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar or has advice for me on how I can stop this. Thank you!

Small hiccups in my journey to the Church,eswagson,1623990721,"I'd like to start out by saying that I have immense respect and love for the Catholic Church and I have been seriously considering beginning the process to become Catholic. That said, I have a few lasting roadblocks. Namely:

\-I disagree with the Church's view on contraception

\-I disagree with the Curch's view on masturbation (not on porn... I completely agree with the Church on porn)

\-This one is minor, but I do also feel that priests should be allowed to marry

If you would like to try and state your case against these then I welcome it, but if I'm being honest, these are all things (especially the top 2) that I have spent an extraordinary amount of time mulling over in my mind, and I feel pretty confident that my mind won't be changed by now.

Dreams and how to approach them,Pfroggy1,1623990530,"Well for context, I should start with this weird gift I seem to possess where every so often I have a dream of something small (usually an image, some bit of conversation, etc.) and then sometimes the next day or a few days/weeks later.

I know we see dreams used regularly in the Bible by God to foretell the future, but this has not been some radical gift where I see world changing events or anything. Just like a small conversation/almost like I have lived said experience before.

Today it happened with something absolutely wild where I had a dream where I saw a certain image in a very certain way.

Questions about INVALIDLY received sacraments.,ConfusedChurchKid,1623987958,"Hi! I've been told that, ""God is not bound by the sacraments,"" and so He can give graces apart from them.

I would like to ask for some clarifications:

1. Let's say that a person invalidly received the sacrament of baptism through no fault of his own. Is it ***possible*** (not absolute) that God still gave him the grace of justification that normally come from the sacrament, thus making him a *true member of the Catholic Church*?
2. Let's say that same person wanted to become a priest, not knowing that his baptism of water was invalid. He then invalidly received the sacrament of holy orders, due to not having validly received the sacrament of baptism. In other words, his ordination from the bishop was invalid. Is it  ***possible*** (not absolute) that God could still directly ordain that person Himself apart from the sacrament and apart from the bishop, thus making him a *true priest (but not a priest sacramentally)*?
3. If God is able to ordain said person as a true priest apart from the sacraments, then is it ***possible*** (not absolute) that the sacraments administered later on by that person are validly given?

"Conciliarism, Papal Infallibility, and more",Runaway_Poet,1623972382,"Hello,

I have a question regarding the level of assent which is required by different degrees of Church teaching over history. Specifically, the issue of ""conciliarism"" which has been related to most theological battles over the past 7 centuries of the church.

Conciliarism is, in essence, the belief that the supreme authority of the Church rests in the hands of an ecumenical council, over and above that of the Pope. An ecumenical council of the Church would, therefore, be capable of deposing and instituting the Pope, overrulling the pope on matters of church teaching, and other such things which would be a logical consequence of the idea. Conciliarism was taught as the official teaching of the church at the Council of Constance which was held from 1414-1418, and the Council stated that anyone who disagreed with this was anathema. Following this pronouncement, the Pope who reigned in the decades after the Council, Martin V, rejected this aspect of the council's teaching. Instead, he reinforced the idea that the Pope was supreme on Earth and could not be overruled by an ecumenical council. Battles between conciliarists and ""ultramontanists"" (the name of those who supported the supremacy of the Pope, particularly in the French speaking world) continued until the First Vatican Council, where the idea of papal infallibility was officially proclaimed, and conciliarism was ultimately defeated.

Therefore, if one were to hold to reasonably consider the conciliarist opinion, it would run into a number of contradictions:

First, that the First Vatican Council had rejected conciliarism. This, though, would be admissible due to the fact that the idea of conciliarism does not necessarily entail the infallibility of ecumenical councils.

Second, that the Pope has infallibly rejected conciliarism through his definition of Papal infallibility and the number of other pronouncements by Popes on the matter. This, however, runs into an issue of circular logic: conciliarism is false because the Pope has papal infallibility. I know this because the Pope infallibly proclaimed his infallibility, therefore conciliarism cannot be true.

Therefore, if one were to be a conciliarist, it would necessitate rejecting the idea of Papal infallibility; but this would be logical, since conciliarism would never admit the idea to begin with. Therefore, it is possible for the Pope to be in error when teaching regarding Papal infallibility. This, though, runs into the problem of rejecting something which has been infallibly proclaimed, but either it is infallible or fallible that the Pope is infallible, and the idea of Papal infallibility automatically rules out the possibility of Papal infallibility being a fallible doctrine.

I assume, therefore, that it is impossible now to be a conciliarist, but is it possible to consider it as a possibility?",Catholicism

I've lived my life with anger and sadness for about 6 years and it has drained me. I think the best way to stop my seemingly ceaseless frustrations are to look at some of the causes...

A. I had a huge crush on a girl (close friends with her as well) and about 6 years ago, we went to separate high schools. I started to really miss her and I'm still kind of struggling to let go of the past.

B. Politics and the Immorality in society constantly annoy me, especially since it seems like nobody is doing anything to stop the evils of the world.

C. In the high school I went to I was increasingly defensive and it caused me to make very few friends and made me a target for bullies. The only friendships I made either didn't last or were due to them being friends with family members.

Please help me!,WeakBluebird9977,1623961371,"
I’m not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I need help. About 6 months ago, around Christmas, I had a dream that my family and I converted to Catholicism. We currently attend a United Methodist church, but we’re not very involved and don’t attend regularly. I am 35, my husband is 40, and my kids are 6 (daughter) and 3 (son). I don’t remember much about the dream, but the feelings of peacefulness and serenity, as well as the sense of unity within my family, made me feel so good. When I was younger, I was very devoted to my faith, so I do have a fairly strong background in Christianity, but not Catholicism. My best friend of many years is Catholic so I do have some background with the faith. After this dream, I found myself wanting to study the Bible each day and make time to pray with my children and by myself. I found the Bible in a year read by Father Mike Schmitz and his YouTube videos and started watching them. I learned about the rosary. I have prayed the rosary every day for the last several months (I do this in the car on the way to work or when I have a break during the day). I hope this isn’t offensive for me to pray the rosary even though I’m not Catholic. It has brought me so much peace. I’ve also been researching Catholicism and read a lot about human dignity, which perfectly aligns with my own beliefs/ feelings. My relationship with my husband was strained before this, but I’ve found when I pray for him it is hard to have bad feelings for him. As a side note, my children attend a Catholic school, and I’m a public school teacher. We chose the school because of its academic reputation, but I have to think my positive feelings about the school probably influenced the dream! Anyway, I waited until April to tell my husband all about my newfound interest in joining the Catholic Church. He has not been open to this at all. He was raised in the Mormon church, and while he had left that church before we even met, I have to think that this background might be a huge stumbling block to his agreeing to join. I’ve been reading a lot about St. Monica and have even prayed a novena to her, praying for guidance on how to make this work. I feel that if my husband were surrounded by good, Catholic men, his opinion of the church would change. That’s been one of my most frequent prayers. At this point, he says that he doesn’t even want me or the children to go to church. He has become more and more angry when we talk about it, yelling in my face and even pinching me so hard it left bruises. He had been physically abusive before, but he had made a big effort to stop. He’s always been controlling and had a temper, but the idea of joining the Catholic Church brings out the worst in him. To be clear, he doesn’t want to go to church anywhere at all. I am at a loss here. I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing by submitting to what he wants and praying patiently, or am I being a pushover and doing wrong by my children by not going against his wishes and taking them to church anyway? My gut tells me that the fact he had such a strong reaction means God might be working on him already, and he is trying to resist that. Does anyone have any advice?",Catholicism

In what sense was Christ charged with our sins on the Cross? (see post for details),The_New_Convert,1623957183,"I was reading Leviticus 16, where the day of atonement is described. I understand that the Scape Goat is supposed to be a type of Christ but not sure of what the significance/meaning of the High Priest confessing the sins of Israel while placing his hands on the head of the Goat.

And putting both hands upon his head, let him confess all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their offences and sins: and praying that they may light on his head, he shall turn him out by a man ready for it, into the desert. - Leviticus 16:21 DRA

I checked the Haydock Commentary on this and he had this to say:

Ver. 8.  The emissary-goat: caper emissarius; in Greek, apopompaios; in Hebrew, Hazazel.  The goat to go off, or as some translate it, the scape-goat.  This goat, on whose head the high priest was ordered to pour forth prayers, and to make a general confession of the sins of the people, laying them all, as it were, on his head; and after that to send him away into the wilderness, to be devoured by wild beasts, **was a figure of our Saviour, charged with all our sins, in his passion.**

State of young Catholicism ( revisited),TheKingsPeace,1623950532,"Hello all. I am a young Catholic and have commented on the state of young Catholic life several times before especially as compared to young evangelical life.

Based on what I’ve observed firsthand and heard by experience, young evangelical life is a pretty happening place. The churches are often packed to the gills and they find creative ways of bringing secular friends to church. 

Even the mainline evangelical churches that aren’t “ Hillsong” are fairly packed. I was at a Bible study through Bible Study fellowship and saw at least 100’people there.

For whatever reason, whenever I’ve been in Catholic life ( minus st Paul’s outreach in college) it’s been often scarce/ hit or miss.

Apparently many Catholic Churches have hardly any young adult life outside of married couples. I’m lucky to go to a church that does. I have noticed though that a great many of the people there are from out of town and don’t know anyone. Not that there is anything wrong with that but I’ve noticed some social difficulties/ awkwardness among a good number that seems higher then the general population I’m in. I see very few to no people like me, who have been raised in my church and continue practicing the faith.

I have some ideas. First of all Catholicism ( and religion in general) tends to have at least a less transactional view of granting affection and warmth to others then the general population. Those with awkwardness/ social difficulties might feel more welcome there ( and should) in a way they wouldn’t among many other groups.

As to the scarcity/ paucity of people and the more scattered/ disparate character of the groups? I think often if your a young married Catholic you do not see the need for them. 

Also ( we can’t forget this) being Catholic is hard work, much harder then being an evangelical. It is probably the biggest check on your own will/ impulses that exists today and involves giving up many things: contraception, cohabitation, sleeping in on sundays, looking out for number 1 etc.”

Honestly I think the reason our numbers are falling is many young millennials with options/ comfortable life don’t see the upside to practicing and imposing hardships on themselves. Hence the scanty numbers.

Thoughts on Wijngaards Institute for Catholic Research and should Catholic institutions be more proactive?,WreathedinShadow,1623939122,"To those unaware, there is a ""progressive"" Catholic research institution in the UK. They've recently put out a paper that is, of course, centred around supposedly proving same sex activity isn't a sin. They are so confident in their work that they state it's ""the final nail in the coffin"" that proves this opinion. Reading some of their points, especially on Leviticus, was pretty frustrating given some of the conclusions that are predicated on a lot of 'hoop-jumping'. My first question is, have any of you heard of the intuition and what is your response to it?

Now someone like me doesn't have the time, desire, or platform to make a response so my second question is, do you think other Catholic institutions who disagree with the opinions of Wijngaard should be more proactive in elaborating their views so that papers like that don't go unchecked?

"Prayers for Jordan Peterson, and how can we help him?",TylexTy,1623938301,"There's probably been no bigger push on me to return to Catholicism than Jordan Peterson.

He's even said once something along the lines of ""as a psychologist we hold the door open to Heaven"" it's almost like that is his role in the story, that he is trying to save everyone and will sacrifice himself in doing so, which sounds a lot like he's trying to become Jesus, without believing in Jesus.

If you've been following him, especially his talks about religion, he is suffering a great deal. If you are familiar with his talk with Jonathan Pageau he says in Jesus we see the narrative world and the objective world touch and that he probably believes that. He breaks down here. To me it's obvious that something close to realizing the beauty of life, that God has been knocking on his door telling him to come home and that everything's good and stuff, but of course I'm just guessing about his mental life in that moment, but he himself has said ""in my practice, when someone breaks down, I say ok what was that, what went through your mind just then?"". 

He has said that Catholicism is as sane as people get too. I'm guessing prayer is really the only thing I can do and lament on here.

Streaming Question,New-Parsnip-3921,1623936253,"In short: streamed a movie from a sketchy website since I couldn’t access an account to the real thing.

Didn’t think I had access, so I asked someone I know thought had access if I could log into their account. Didn’t wait around long for a response since it was getting late, so I just went for the free streaming option. Started feeling pretty bad about it today.

Is this a sin? My reasoning for going forward with it initially had been that I knew I could watch it on someone else’s account who I knew would share the account if I just asked, but now that I know i had access all along, where does that put me? Can you steal something you already have?

"Catholic Investing; Jacob Imam, Pints with Aquinas",BaroqueBarrage,1623934269,"Those that have seen the Pints with Aquinas interview with Jacob Imam ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlCv3kYy\_LM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlCv3kYy_LM))

or looked through the content on his website/YouTube channel (https://newpolity.com/) / ([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5rlAYHqhHtYGbPwR6C\_Odw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5rlAYHqhHtYGbPwR6C_Odw)),

what are your thoughts on his view of investing, saving, and retirement?

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the main points that he and contributors makes, to the best of my understanding, are as follows:

* Investing in immoral companies (even within mutual funds), as well as any company you do not work for, is a sin and it is only okay to invest in the company you work for.
* ""Buy low, Sell high"" has been condemned by just about every saint.
* To invest just for the sake of profit is not okay. You have to want to provide something good to the world. Your investments have to be building up the public good. Activities should be oriented to the goods of the investments and not just the profits they produce.
* Investments must be risky. Investing in the S&amp;P is hardly risky at all because of the type of companies they pick for it.
* Be skeptical of your 401k and consider cashing/closing it out. 
   * You don't know what those dollars are doing/for (blind investing) and that is a slippery slope to greed where you just expand into the infinite sum of accumulation and you get profit for profits sake at that point. Gaining something from somebody without doing labor for it strips away from us the understanding of the dignity of work itself (i.e. wealth without work, product without labor).
   * It orients people to a false vision of what investing is for, not for the common good but for one's private good, having adverse effects on one's community.
   * Work is a gift. We should not be thinking about when we get to retire, but preparing for the time when we cannot work anymore. Not when we don't want to work, but cannot work.
   * Being a burden on people (i.e. kids) is not something bad, but a design God gave. One should rely on friends, family, and productive property (i.e. land, company/business, etc.), to be taken care of.
   * It's hard to extract one's money once it's in a retirement account, which puts brakes on giving away larger sums of money and prevents you from becoming a generous person.
   * You are separating yourself from the money giving it to Amazon, Google, etc. to grow and expand. You'll get interest back on that at retirement age, but for now it's theirs. You've given away control of your money. Cashing out returns that control.
   * Creates bonds of loyalty to systems of incentives that a higher salary does not, keeping you at a company
* Money is a placeholder and you need to know what it holds a place for. You can't have a general savings account as that is an amassed power for any end. You can't just save generally, you have to save specifically. Is this something that is here because you don't trust God to take care of you or is it something that's here because it is proper to your vocation and those who have been given to your care.
   * Once the needs of the man are taken care of the profits go to the common good.
   * It is entirely legitimate within a particular vocation to have no emergency fund and rely entirely upon providence. At some point your saving against disaster will indicate a lack of trust in God to take care of you. The prerequisite closure to the possibility of miraculous help gets what it asks for. If you live a life in which money is the means you are saved, then that is what will save you.
* Real estate is okay, but you should not rent to families. People are habituated to be renters. They need to be encouraged to buy homes and live in them. Get people who genuinely need a short term place to stay: companies, students, diplomats, etc.
* If you enter into business just for the sake of getting more money, that is something you have to go to confession for.

&amp;#x200B;

This is in stark contrast to the standard advice for investing, saving, and retirement. Is this because the standard advice goes against Catholic teaching or is their understanding wrong? My initial thought is that they are correct given they quote saints like Thomas Aquinas and Augustine, as well as [reference](https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2021/04/29/210429b.html) the change to canon law that Pope Francis made regarding Vatican finances. However, the stock market wasn't created for \~500 years after Aquinas's death so I'm not sure how applicable his financial advice his.

Their comments, as well as Pope Francis's decree, seem to remove any avenue of investing that isn't a risky startup or your own company (i.e. S&amp;P 500, Total Market Fund, etc.). It also seems to remove Catholic funds like Ave Maria.

The idea that you should not have retirement/investment accounts and rely on friends, family, and productive property (i.e. land, company/business, etc.), to take care of you in retirement doesn't seem right to me.

The idea of retirement/investment accounts, at least in the FIRE community, is to never touch the principle and pull from the dividends or capital gains. This goes against their points against large savings.

"If priests grant communion to people (i.e. politicians) who they know support abortion rights, does this put the priests in mortal sin?",IonClawz,1623934113,"I'm posting this because I am very irritated at the b.s. US Cardinals are espousing ""warning"" other bishops not to discuss denying communion to parishoners (i.e. politicians) they know actively support abortion ""rights.""

Why this is even a question is beyond me, one Bishop in Washington state even invited Joe Biden to take communion in his diocese.

Obviously, taking communion while supporting abortion rights is sacrilege, but wouldn't providing communion to someone who is widely known to suppory abortion also make the priests accessories to such mortal sin?

And is the Church really this full of heretics? Abortion is clearly and unambiguously stated by the Church to be a grave moral wrong, it is not some subjective approach to preaching or leading parishes.",Catholicism
I was fooled. I thought the guy really was an exorcist.,NotJoking777,1623933548,"So I was searching youtube for exorcist videos and I saw one come up that looked real good to me since it was from a user that I've seen videos from before. The user used to do like social awkwardness comedy but then did a series of ""chatting with"" interviews where he talks to all different people in like different professions and other things  like ""chatting with a former meth head"". Most of the talks seem real interesting so I've seen a few of them.

So I of course see that he has a ""chatting with an exorcist"" video and get real excited to watch that one. I watch the whole 24 minute video thinking this guy is a real exorcist and then I scroll down to read the comments and the user admits that this is a fake video and the guy was just an actor pretending to be an exorcist. And also made the rude comment of comparing it to ""chatting with santa clause"" since I guess he thinks exorcists aren't real any ways.

Here's a link to the video in question [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGi5goU21nQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGi5goU21nQ)

 This isn't the first time I've been fooled either. Another time a different youtuber fooled me by thinking a video of his where he was in an abandoned house and a ""drug dealer"" came in and almost found him but turns out the ""drug dealer"" was just acting too. I believed that one for months before the user came out to say it was fake. Was the scariest video I'd ever seen until learned it was fake.

So both times users I trusted ended up fooling me. How does this reflect on me? Am I just stupid and gullible? What does the Bible say about being fooled?",Catholicism

Why Are Humans So Cruel To Eachother? ( Serious Question),MidnightAxeMan,1623928943,"The Church teaches that God created man in His image and likeness, and for that reason human life is of infinite value. We were made to know, love, and serve God, and to eventually spend eternity with Him in Heaven. This is the sole purpose of every human being and God loves all of us unconditionally. Now I do agree with this, but upon examining much of human history and currently looking to world events, I can not help but wonder, why are humans so cruel to each other? 

When I was younger I used to think that humans were never really to violent to each other until the modern times( boy I was naïve) but now that I am older I realize human history has been plagued with sometimes insensitive cruelty and violence since the begining of time. Some examples that come to mind are but not limited to; pagan sacrifices, King Herod, Spanish Inquisition, Vlad of Wallachia, Caligula, Ghenghis Khan, Nero, Hitler, Rwandan Genocide, Pol Pot, Stalin, Cartels, slavery, rape, sex trafficking, serial killers, ISIS, Idi Amin, Conquistadors, Tribal Warfare, torture, mutilation, ect.

Unfortunately I can go one and on about how awful humans have been to each other. There is without a doubt a lot of evil and horror in this world and it is heartbreaking. But why? Why have humans always sought out to end each other and to destroy each other? I am not just talking about killing. People have always been torturing eachother and inflicting such horrible pain on eachother. Think the Japanese during WW2 and how they experimented on babies or Himmler who kept human skins and skulls as souvenirs. Just so much sadism and ugliness I can not even wrap my head around how one can do this. Does everyone have the potential to be this cruel? Does it have something with do with evolution? Will any of this ever stop? I know this  is a random and seemingly stupid questions but I would like some outside opinions apart from what I am trying to think is the cause of all this. 

TLDR: If humans are made in the image and likeness of God, then why are they do cruel and evil to eachother and have always been? ( Hitler,  Rwanda, Stalin, Slavery, ect.)",Catholicism
Catholic girlfriend upset over Father’s word. Need some advice,javisauce,1623926729,"So for a little background my girlfriend is a devout Catholic and I am a non denominational Christian but was baptized in the Catholic Church as a child. We go to mass every Sunday as well. 

Recently my girlfriend had a conversation with the Father of her Church about a few different things. She asked about receiving the Eucharist at our wedding if we get married (we plan to in the Catholic Church possibly soon). But she was told she couldn’t receive because she was marrying me and I’m not a practicing Catholic. She started crying and was incredibly upset because receiving the Eucharist is so important to her. 

She also had a brief conversation about the availability of confession in our town (once a week for an hour or so) and she felt it should be more available. Usually we go to a different town about 45 minutes away if she needs. He told her she was being selfish and not thinking about the Fathers and their time. She contested that practicing Catholics who take confession seriously would want to confess as soon as they could. 

Today, they had a little retreat at our local church and he gave a lesson. At the end of it he told everyone that they should be careful with their faith and to be careful not to become spiritually narcissistic wanting things like sacraments on their schedule. She got incredibly upset cause even though nobody knew it was about her, she knew. 

I’m not sure how exactly to confort her but she has been feeling hurt all day and she sees him as a spiritual father and leader. I would really love some advice from fellow Catholics. I appreciate you all! Thank you!",Catholicism

Scrupulous or no? I can’t tell anymore,Esphyr,1623902667,"So I was pretty free from an “episode” like this since 2018 and the topic my doubt revolves around is “acting on a doubtful conscience is a sin”.

It started with doubting whether X action was a sin which took me quite awhile to solve even though the answer should’ve been crystal clear to any other person. Then it moved on to topics like “maybe Y is a sin, if I don’t analyse further I’ll be committing a mortal sin because I’m acting on a doubtful conscience”. 

I keep reassuring myself that answering my doubts would eventually lead to peace but it just leads to even more questions. Then I feel compelled to answer those questions before doing anything else other “I’ll be committing a mortal sin because I’m acting on doubt and I don’t know for sure that ignoring this doubt isn’t mortal sin”. 

I know this kind of behaviour and thinking doesn’t seem normal but my mind keeps trying to reassure itself that I just need to seek more answers and read more. 

Either way I’m seeing my psychiatrist next week to hopefully get more answers, but not gonna lie - I feel my mind is just going to just keep up with more questions like “Maybe I didn’t explain the situation good enough, maybe he didn’t understand, maybe I’m just trying to make it seem like I have a condition when I’m just normal
and trying to justify my doubts”.

The more I engage these doubts, the more questions rise and the more irrational thinking “becomes” my conscience even though deep down I know the answer. 

And it’s just this one area I’m seemingly fixated on. I don’t have other typical “scrupulous” worries like whether I’ve prayed correctly, whether my confession was valid, or whether I’m bothered by passing sexual thoughts. For cases like these (e.g, passing sexual thoughts) I can easily rationalise and say “Nope I didn’t consent to it, so no sin”. 

It’s as if my mind is trying to keep me trapped in these doubts. I was honestly about to cry because - as mentioned - I had a similar occurrence that happened in 2018 and thought I was free from it. Now it seems it came back - whatever it is, whether it’s just plain normal doubts or part of a mental condition - to haunt me again.

To add to this, it’s pretty much killed some of my motivation to wake up everyday. I feel more tired than usual and my appetite has gone down a bit. I’ve also had upset stomachs for the past two mornings and woke up with anxiety in my chest. 

Again I do not know if this is because my conscience is guilty (I have been acting against this ‘doubt’ which I recognise as irrational fear but my mind keeps trying to tell me otherwise.) or because I have an actual mental condition.",Catholicism

I found the reason for the high turnover rate amongst Protestants and why Catholicism is the biggest group of Christianity,Swilliams243,1623900446,"“Ordinarily, if the sinful soul turns to the Lord God, it will receive the grace of conversion, but it can happen that the soul will not merit the grace of God because, on the contrary, it is fitting that the justice of God prevail. 

However, if the soul, even though it be I don’t know how sinful, turns to the Immaculate, it will certainly receive grace. St. Bernard says that the Lord God kept for Himself justice, but gave mercy to the Mother of God. I don’t deny that the Immaculate receives the mercy from the Lord God, but she is the personification of this divine mercy, and that is why a soul is converted and sanctified if it turns to her. 

Therefore we know this truth, that through the Immaculate we can become great saints, and this in an easy way.” - St.Maximilian Kolbe, Let Yourself be led by the Immaculate",Catholicism

Just seems like people don't care and/or believe (including bishops),ProLifeCatholic1535,1623894096,"One of the most disheartening things about Catholicism to me is that most people who call themselves Catholic, most people who go to Church, and even a lot of priests and bishops just don't seem to care or believe.

This is not a post about  denying politicians the eucharist (my opinion on that is that it's pretty clear what the right course of action is on this, but I will leave that for Politics Monday) and a common objection is: ""Well if you denied everyone who disagreed with the Church's teachings communion, then less than 50% of Catholics/very few Catholics would be able to receive communion. Are you seriously proposing that?""


This is disheartening in more than one way, but it's also illustrative of my point: Very few people actually believe including the person making the statement. The answer to the statement should be a resounding: YES. It doesn't matter how many would be ""inconvenienced"" by it. The Eucharist is not a cool symbol of how you choose to identify with Catholicism as a cultural symbol and get to hear some cool life lessons at mass.  It is the literal body and blood of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the Church teaches us that receiving it unworthily has massive eternal consequences. If people actually believed that, then no one would even want to go up and receive communion unworthily, and certainly no one would be pushing for it. But it's also true that if people followed the rules on worthily receiving communion, very few would receive. Which means most Catholics just decide they don't care about the Church doctrine. Even though the Church teaches them that they could go to hell!



This is the biggest problem I have with the increased focus on ""evangelization"" and ""ecumenism."" Is evangelization good? Yes. But how on earth are we going to be able to do effective evangelization when potential converts see that most current Catholics don't even really believe. And ecumenism is a good idea if done by a devout believer, but it's a terrible idea if it's done by a wishy-washy Priest or Bishop who basically sees the Church as a cool social club like all the others. And that's the problem we have. No one believes. If we really wanted effective ecumenism and effective dialogue with other Churches, how about making sure Catholics believe. 


I think we need more public excommunications, a Council that brings back Anathemas and clearly anathemizes all common heresies. Make it clear that this stuff is not tolerated. Excommunications and Anathemas are tools of love. It is much more loving to excommunicate someone than to let them persist in sin and go about their day acting like it's all okay, committing sacrilege every Sunday.",Catholicism

I assume that this woman has some intolerance which does not allow her to receive the Host.  The priest brought her a small chalice of the Precious Blood after everyone else was finished Communing.  I assume that she has a prior arrangement with the priest.

Can anyone request this of a pastor celebrating the EF?  I think that there are some people who would like to attend, but find Communion to be a barrier for them due to intolerances.",Catholicism

How does one dispose of a broken crucifix? I do not know if it was ever blessed.,DesertPineTree,1623887388,"My boss and I were throwing away from things at work, and we found this but it was broken.  She said she felt bad about throwing it away, and wondered if there was something special we needed to do to dispose of it.  I said we could ask the sisters who are related to our work and only a block away.  She didn't listen (she often doesn't to me).  She just kept talking and I got nervous as I usually do around her, and I found my head nodding as a nervous gesture, and she placed it in the garbage.  I felt like bad like I was agreeing with it when I nodded when I didn't.

Maybe this is not considered wrong in Catholicism, though.  I do not know.  I know blessed items are supposed to be burned or buried, right?  But I don't know about this.

My boss is a far left-wing feminist, vegan married to a Buddhist.  I mention this because she gets upset when something small doesn't line up with her views or her husbands, like the fact that women's bathroom signs have a dress on woman-logo (""it's old fashioned."")  She gets upset when  a staff member kills a cockroach (for pest-control and to protect our business).  She likes to make others known of her views constantly when it has nothing to do with work.  She's extremely passive-aggressive and bullies people.  I've tried talking to her about it before, and she bursts into tears.  I believe she has mental health problems (I am serious and not using this as an insult).

Even if it's not considered wrong to throw away, the situation bothered me because she expects others to respect her ""faith,"" but she didn't see any reason to respect mine or anyone else's (We are a Catholic institution).  If I were in her position of not knowing, I would have sent it to the sisters (which is free and takes 5 minutes to write them a note).",Catholicism

Looking for some advice to deal with this situation that I'm in,Longjumping_Ad2135,1623881221,"Hello. I have been suffering from scrupulosity for the past several months since I started to practice my faith.

I think I should probably give some context. It got progressively worse with time because I fed into the scrupulous habits, redoing confessions over something small, confessing things just to make sure I wasn't in sin, and the like. The last time I went to Confession, it was really bad, scrupulosity was awful for a few days to the point that after I finished confession (and I thought it was a bad confession too) I just felt like I wanted to be done with it, and I just wanted to stop practicing.

That burnout feeling went away pretty quickly but I haven't been to Confession since, it's been about 6 months. It's not because I don't want to go to confession but I just seem to be stuck because of my scrupulosity. Examining my conscience is excruciating and every time I try to do it so that I can be forgiven, I end up with my mind being flooded with little details and things and confusion. I just don't know what's even required of me exactly. Reading Church teaching about what's required for validity hasn't helped. As a result, I pretty much just wasted time by waiting uselessly because I didn't know what to do.

I heard that scrupulous people aren't bound to the integrity of confession because they have no clarity, but I don't know if this is just naturally the case or if only a priest can dispense a scrupulous person from this obligation. I went to a priest to ask him what I should do, but I didn't get a straight answer. I want to just be able to say ""I did this, this and this, X, Y and Z amount of times"" and be done with it, but I am terrified of doing that because in my mind there is a real possibility that I'm wrong and that that confession would be bad. And the worst thing about it is that I can't just do it by obedience because I have no other priest that I can go to tell me what to do in this case.

Can you please give me some advice?",Catholicism

"a friend, she is requesting certain knowledge of scripture",NaturallyFlavoured,1623871596,"i have been talking to her for years, and she isn't hearing what i say about the fullness of truth of the Catholic church, she has a natural aversion, this coming from someone who laid on the floor of the sistine chapel looking at the ceiling for 45 minutes with permission from the guards ... she has like some kind of mix of spirituality that has no label, a mix of wicca, experiences of transcendence to connect with the drive through nature - that kinda thing ( her words ) ....

i keep running into a problem because when i present anything from Jesus, or specifically the catholic church, or new testament ( interestingly enough, she seems to be very respectful towards judaism and the old testament, rabbis as an authority - probably due to her family and friends relations although she is not jewish, or anything official ) 

i had tried before, and talked about Mary ... but she dismissed it like ""is that all the catholic church has, is mary"" type of thing ...

she talks about genesis, and how the woman is blamed, and talks about how there is the father, the son, the holy spirit, and says these are all men, and then talks about the religion itself and the structure of it being patriarchal, and so oppressive and exclusionary-- no woman priests, woman can't teach in church, etc  - but also on a deeper level she says she is unable to relate to the religion of christianity because of the woman issue 

here is the last message from her:

&gt;i asked you quite a while ago, given your knowledge of scripture, if you could find passages that speak of good women, that speak of women that were heroic and not villains.  I told you that there wasn't a sacred space for me in the Church.  I tried to explain that it is easy to be a man in the Church.

&gt;It's possible that i have found some such passages of good women with wisdom due to readings and passages that i heard &amp; read during my niece's bat mitvah.  maybe i'll reach out to her rabbi or maybe i'll reach out to my father's college roomate that is a genius and a rabbi.  there are spiritual leaders in the Judeo-Christian community that are friends of the family, perhaps they can point me in the direction of scripture that offers me something.

alright - so you don't see the detailed ""fight"" we basically had before this, ongoing - years - has really strained our friendship, because there is this impassable wall between us, because of the Catholic issue, and her beliefs about it, perception about it, I almost like gave up, quoted her Corinthians 6:14 and that really upset her, but it's like OK - i've tried personally with just me, and so I think there is something in the Catholic church about escalating this to the Church, so maybe she will ask the rabbi and eventually that will lead her to Catholic/Jesus - but can anyone help me help her, is there a Priest here or anyone, a woman - or anyone who can relate to what she is talking about, because I reversed and put myself in her shoes, and I can actually understand what she is talking about, I mean it would be weird as a man if I was saying ""in the name of the mother, the daughter, and the holy spirit"" and all the apostles were women, and they didn't allow men, and the stories were all casting men as the villain, and none of them showing anything good ... so she has a point, and she is really smart, reads a lot of books, so I have been really wracking over trying to find a way to present the catholic church and the new testament of Jesus and the bible in a way that she feels she is actually included, respected, and something that she can even start to take a look at.",Catholicism

Trans and Catholic? How to respond?,solivagant-shadow,1623855418,"So I was on the Catholic side of tumblr (shocking right? It exists!) and I was browsing through blogs when in the biography of one of them it said Catholic along with Transgender. I was confused and messaged this person obviously. Here is our conversation so far…I need some help with responding-

Me: No offense but why are u transgender and Catholic when this against the teaching of the church..?

Them: Hi! The Church has accepted me fully as a Catholic. I was raised Catholic and received Confirmation just this past Easter. My priest and parish know I am transgender and have all accepted me and I receive communion every week. Nobody is barred from converting to Catholicism. As long as one goes through the faith formation process, anyone can be received into Catholicism. Catholic actually means 'universal' because this is a church for everyone- there is a seat for every person at the table of Christ. He does not deny any person who runs towards Him. His arms are opened to all, including transgender people. I hope in the future you may just be happy to see that there are a variety of people who have found their faith and place their love in our beloved Christ.

Me: I’m confused, so you converted as a transgender person? Or were you always practicing

Them: I was baptized and raised Catholic, but became lapsed in my teen years. Two years ago is when I decided to come back to Catholicism, and then last year is when I went through RCIA to receive the rest of the sacraments.

Me: So you became trans when you weren’t practicing?

Them: I have always been transgender, I didn't 'become' it.

I'm sorry, but do you have good intentions in messaging me about this or are you trying to 'correct' me? I'm transgender and Catholic and there isn't anything wrong with that. I don't feel comfortable talking to a person who isn't willing to learn about me as a person and is instead so focused and concerned about my identity. I'm okay with talking about my experiences as a transgender Catholic but I am not going to entertain anyone who is out to 'prove me wrong', especially a random stranger online.

"Saint Joseph of Cupertino, a powerful intercessors for test takers!",MorelsandRamps,1623851581,"Hi all, I just thought I’d share my experience with St. Joseph of Cupertino and his intercession. I hope this post can inspire more devotion to him!

So I work in the financial industry. I sort of fell into it I guess, it wasn’t my first choice of a career. But in order to keep my job, I had to pass a couple of increasingly difficult tests, a process that’s referred to as “getting registered.” One is the famous Series 7 exam, which is pretty difficult. Without these exams, you’re  useless to most employers and your likely to get fired. I did get fired from one firm because I didn’t have all my tests done.

I was a liberal arts major in college, so learning the complexities of the financial world was very difficult for me. I failed the Series 7 twice, and if I failed a third time it was implied I’d lose my job. So I looked up the patron of test takers and was happy to find the story of St Joseph. St Joseph is famous for his levitations, but I came to find out he had a similar relationship to test taking as I did. He needed to pass some exams to enter seminary, and had a difficult time learning and retaining information. He threw himself on the mercy of God, and miraculously , his exam only had questions he knew the answers to. He passed of course and became a priest and a great saint for the kingdom of God.

I turned to St. Joseph and asked for his intercession to help me pass. And , like him, the test I took only had questions I knew the answers to. I passed, through the mercy of God and through the intercession of St Jospeh of Cupertino.

If you’re struggling with studying and exams, ask for his help! He will not let you down! Here are some prayers I found helpful:

Books on Catholicism from a magical perspective?,HardBipartisanTruths,1623838907,"I know there've been countless books written covering concrete history, fact checking the Bible's accounts, explaining the beneficial social mechanisms of the Church, and attempting to make compelling arguments for faith based in reason and observable events.

However, I read an essay once that stuck with me, and it was one which claimed that the biggest enemy of faith today is not reason or science; it's the predominant belief that humans know everything, which is neither reasonable nor scientific. It's the belief that if something exists, then we must have already observed it and understand it, and if we can't explain it then it must not exist, which is itself a view that's based on faith, just sort of a faith in human infallibility.

This faith in human infallibility has replaced faith in anything magical or higher than man, which is especially odd given that we repeatedly prove that humans do not fully understand most things, and are even less capable of taking appropriate action based on our understandings of most things. Belief in the infallibility of man is a lot like belief that a habitual drunk driver would never drive drunk.

This seems like it's really heavily related to pride, or at least it seems like it to me. What else would you call it when somebody believes they can't possibly be wrong no matter how many times they're wrong?

So, I thought it might be useful to take a break from reading books that attempt to painstakingly prove mechanisms of religion and realities of history, and instead read something... the opposite? I'm not quite sure what I'm asking for. I think it would be interesting to read a book that assumes a magical universe and works backwards from there, rather than most things, which assume a logical universe and build from that.",Catholicism

"Eternity is a long, long time",Falandorn,1623836449,"I often think about eternity, I wrote a short reflection on [hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/9w7y17/a_cry_from_hell/) a while ago and I still struggle with the enormity of endless time.


I watched a video a while back on parallel universes and that came to mind yesterday thinking of infinity which is hand in hand with eternal life.


I imagined the Big Bang theory which ultimately will result in the Big Crunch as there is no escaping gravity if we are to hold true general relativity and the laws that bind it. Sooner or later by attraction the universe will reach a point where expansion gives way to contraction the galaxies slow, stop and then start to pull back towards the centre resulting in a singularity. This will explode and the universe will again reset with another big bang and this process will repeat endlessly.


So the universe is quite old by our standards, [13.8 billion years](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/3287409001) which is the most recent estimates. Current expansion of the universe is supposed to be accelerating so it might be a while before it slows or eventually stops. Whether it does stop where we suffer [heat death](http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150602-how-will-the-universe-end) or it all contracts again is not important to this post, just for discussion imagine that trillions of years in the future the universe will contract and reset.


If this was to happen an infinite number of times and we pretend our current universe is the first time ever, in the future we can assume that every possibility is possible for permutations of these universes. So eventually after enough resets we will get a universe identical to our current one, on a long enough time line of infinity this becomes a fact, this universe will spawn life and eventually you will be born exactly the same but perhaps you will have green eyes, a later version you might have blue or brown eyes, instead of getting that job you were after you get a different one. You might have a different child or partner or perhaps marry their sibling instead. 


If we are to accept infinity is forever it means in this scenario of repeating universes, *every* possibility will occur at some point, it might be the second reset or some unimaginably long reset number in the future. Infinity like eternity is a *really* long time.


So where is this going? I'm trying to wrap my head around something impossible to imagine, eternity. To live for eternity or to die for eternity.


The idea of suffering in that state of hell forever is astonishing, if humans only realised the high-stakes game they play with their lives each day. If we could just glimpse at eternity we would spend 50-60 years kneeling on broken glass if it was a guarantee of Heaven. I think the Martyrs had a glimpse of this eternity while on earth.

I've recently started to follow along at daily morning TLM. Since it is very early I haven't been able to ask these questions to anyone. The last days I've noticed the following:

\- June 15th (Tuesday: Commemoration of SS. Vitus, Modestus and Crescentia Martyrs): No epistle? Is it that we turn to the ""Common of Martyrs"" and read the Epistle from there? But if so why doesn't it say so?

\- June 16th (Wednesday): This day is not included at all? Here, today, the priest chose to celebrate St. Joseph. Is it the case that when there is nothing specific to celebrate we turn to the ""regular days""? E.g., Saturdays are ""the Mass of Our Lady"" etc?

\- At the end of the mass, right before the priest and the server walk out, they say a prayer that the attendants respond to. It is not in Latin but in native tongue, but I can't hear it. I just here the attendants respond something that sounds like the second part of the Hail Mary. First I thought it was the Angelus prayer, but then I heard something with ""Peter and Paue""?

Stuck in Perpetual Sin,TatorT00t,1623812391,"Sorry in advance for the long read.

For about the last 3 years, I have been struggling with masturbation. Up until the last handful of months, I've been a lukewarm Catholic. Since then, I've grown (and keep growing) in my faith exponentially. Nonetheless, my addiction has persisted. Within these last 3 years, the longest I've gone without committing this sin was 2 weeks.

This past Triduum, I stopped on Holy Thursday. On Holy Saturday, I went to confession, and at the Easter Vigil, I received Holy Communion with a completely clean soul (the first time in a long time). For about the next week, I felt truly free, and truly happy. I didn't even feel tempted to commit the sin again. In times past, I had made it about 4 days, but I fought temptation through the whole course of time. In this Easter instance, I was going through my days without a single thought of it. However, after roughly 6 days, I began to feel tempted again. Two weeks after I stopped on that Holy Thursday, I had once again fallen into sin.

Since then I've been locked in the cycle of perpetual sin. I can't go more than over a week without committing the sin again. Every single week its right back to the confessional. Going to confession before every mass has basically become a habit for me out of pure necessity.

While praying the rosary one day, a certain Bible verse came into my mind. It was Mark 9:43 (""If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off"", and so on). I began looking through my life and finding things that lead me to sin, and then removed them from my life. I unfollowed people on social media whose posts could cause me to fall; I deleted any pictures or videos I had saved that could inspire me to sin. I closed any avenue of sin that persisted in my life. Yet, I still kept falling. I started excessively praying daily, between the Liturgy of the Hours, Divine Mercy Chaplet, and Rosary, I did my best to set aside time for God every day. Yet, I still keep falling.

I've reached a point where I'm just tired of it. I'm tired of being forced (because of my desire for the Eucharist) to go to Confession every single week because I keep sinning gravely. I'm tired of being left empty by this sin. I *want* to stop, I *want* to feel that freedom, happiness, and grace I felt for those days following Easter. I *want* all of that, but it just feels like I'm being left to fight these temptations on my own. In all honesty, this cycle of sin has shaken my faith. It's not that I've stopped believing or anything like that, but I can feel a sense of resentment forming towards God. ""Why won't you help me?"" I plea. I know that God is just and all-loving, so the fact that it feels like my struggles are being ignored just makes me upset. I've shed tear after tear because of this cycle of falling, confessing, and repeating every week, and despite what I've done, nothing is working.

Fishing with St. Peter,StaindGlassLover,1623807638,"This is coming from a weird place. I was listening to the speech from *The Young Pope* on peace.

https://youtu.be/7T8qlDIDKso

Not the best show, I know, but it has its moments. During the course of the speech, Pius described what peace was. He talked of a waterfall in Colorado. 

When I heard this, I was taken back to my 20’s. I was on the forecastle of a destroyer in the South Pacific. The smell of cordite from a live fire exercise was being washed away by a gentle trade wind and the sky was a perfect brilliant orange in the early evening. 

I then went to my 30’s where I was in the valley of a mountain range somewhere in Wyoming in an 18-wheeler all alone. I remember feeling sad because I had no one to share with on what I was seeing. It was cold, distant, and beautiful. 

Suddenly, remember one my favorite passages from the Bible, John 21:15-17. I meditate on it often. Being a Northeastern Floridian, I can smell the shoreline algae from this passage. I can feel the silty mud curling between my toes. The mugginess from the morning air.

Everything I’ve heard about Heaven is a swirling vortex of angels and souls eternally praising God. Yet, I hold out the hope that I can be with Simon Peter at that moment when he says to Jesus that he loves Him. To me, it’s the apex of the whole Bible.

From my Catechism I know that I don't have to accept Jesus as my ""Lord and Saviour"" because through my baptism and confirmation Jesus has already claimed me as one of his own.

In addition, his letters clearly show a life-long devotion to the faith and taking action in its service. He was raised by a priest and one of his sons even entered the clergy.

That being said, I'm just a member of the laity and certainly not privy to the nuances, details, and knowledge of the Church seniors who reach this conclusion that will lead to sainthood.

In process of converting. Overwhelming.,Alexsandro_frs,1623795615,"I don't even know how to start, honestly. Brace yourselves for a long read.

I'm a 18 year old man, from Brazil.

I grew up in a semi-catholic house, like, my parents and grandparents always believed, with pictures of Jesus, Mary and the saints around the house, they always make the cross with their hands when passing in front of a church, and they pray when before sleep and after waking up.

Then there's me. Grew up really lonely, never made connections with anyone. An introverted and melacholic boy. Also, really, really scared of dying. I remember when I was 6 and asking my grandma if I could just never die, and she would answer me something like: ""No, but if you pray enough, God will give you a long, happy life.""

I remember being in traffic with my father and just start crying at the thought of dying. It went on for a long time. Always terribly scared of death. My own death. Not others.

Fast forward a few years, I became an atheist. It made sense. Then, the fear of just stop existing kicked in and I started praying again. It when on like this until 2019.

The praying and reaching out stop working and I had my first depression episode. For two weeks I barely ate and almost didn't leave my bed. When the thought of ending my own life crossed my mind, the same fear that make everything meaningless made me panic about ending it, so I went to therapy. Now a agnostic. It worked out until covid.

When Covid-19 started here, the schools were closed for almost the entire year. Being trapped inside my house for that long made me fall into depression again and just masturbate half the time I was awake, witch it was the time everyone else slept. I pulled myself up when everything opened again.

But the fear. That panic. It was still here, hunting me for as long as I can remember. 

A few weeks ago, I started getting problems to sleep. I still do actually. The thought is constantly around. But this time, after a few years, I reached out again, and started praying.

The problem was, I didn't felt anything different. But I was just a heretic praying, maybe I should do something else, like leaning about the Catholic Church and all the Sacred things. 

(Not really in the Church, Covid-19 still rages the country and my family doesn't go to Church)

I did. And I reached the bare surface. I kinda know what is a sin, the commandments, the Trinity God and the basic stuff. But I also discovered that masturbating is like, a huge sin and should be avoided at all costs.

It has been almost a week without it and it's way harder than I thought. Also, condoms and pre marital sex are also terribly wrong, so I'll have a really hard time finding a partner.

And I barely learnt anything. I know that there's so much to learn and pray. Its just overwhelming.",Catholicism

hello

I recently made a post on the Orthodoxy Subreddit which explains who I am and why I am looking for faith. Here is a copy paste of my post that explains my situation: 

 

*Hello*

*I am interested in converting to Orthodox, specifically Russian Orthodox (I don't know the differences yet) I was born and raised as a Canadian, my parents are from Northern Iran and we are partially from a community of Russo-Persians, as many Russians immigrated and 100+ years ago.*

*I was raised without religion, but now I am at a time when I need to find faith - I don't have any interest in Islam, which 2 of my other grandparents follow, My great-grandmother was a Russian-speaking Orthodox, my dad remembers there being an Orthodox church in his town growing up, Orthodoxy is dying in Iran because the government is hostile to non-muslim conversions or preaching, as a remnant in an often forgotten story of Russians in Iran, I want to reconnect with that faith.*

*I've seen many people on this sub switching from one form of Christianity to Orthodox, but I've never been baptized or practised any faith, although I have gone to a catholic school and have religious education.*

*so idk, what do I do? where do I start? is this type of conversion even allowed? I heard this sub was very friendly and could help*

 I explained that my closest link to Christianity was my Orthodox grandmother. However, I know nothing about Orthodoxy - I went to catholic school and know the catholic theology better and tend to agree more with the lifestyle - wondering if Catholicism is a better for me

Thoughts on Effective Altruism When Giving to the Poor?,ProLifeCatholic1535,1623790952,"One thing we are all called to do is give to the poor if we are able. Obviously, we need to make sure that the needs of our parish are met, and that should be a first priority, but we can also give to other charities. For those of you who don't know, ""effective altruism"" is a strategy heavily promoted by GiveWell which is interested in promoting charities which are evidence-based, and have strong utilitarian benefits to the world's poorest. These charities usually do things like deworming programs for kids in very poor countries, malaria prevention programs, and vitamin supplementation. It also usually implies prioritizing the people in very poor developing countries as opposed to those in developed countries.

I was wondering if effective altruism, pioneered by sites like GiveWell is a good way to give to the poor?

I'll add a couple caveats:

1. The Doctrine of Double Effect obviously applies. It is obviously not permitted to give a lot of money to a charity which tries to provide ""benefits"" to the poor by giving them contraceptives. An intrinsically evil means cannot be justified by good ends. I could definitely see this popping up in the future, and it would not be licit to give to. Luckily, currently, most of the ""effective altruism"" means are morally good or neutral actions like providing poor people with malaria bed nets, vitamin supplementation, deworming medicine, antimalarial drugs or just cash.

2. We are not consequentialists, so no one should be compelled to give to these charities. A consequentialist worldview would say that giving to a non ""effective altruist"" charity would be a morally evil action and that we are morally compelled to give to charities like this. The Church has condemned consequentialism, and obviously, anything you give to the poor with good intentions is good, no matter what charity you give to.

With that said, should Catholics be interested in effective altruism charities? I am no expert in Philosophy or Moral Theology so PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't we be interested in making sure our donations to the poor have the most impact and help the world's poorest? I would think that it is good and pleasing to God to do a lot of research on the charities you give to in order to make sure your money is effective in helping the world's poorest and most desperate? Is there anything wrong with prioritizing charitable donations to the poor to go towards the poor in foreign countries as opposed to the domestic poor?

Edit: I did find one contraception charity on GiveWell: ""Living Goods."" It is not a ""top"" charity, but rather a ""standout"" one that they give a very tiny percentage to, but they still give out contraceptives. However, the Top charities (other than the Maximum Impact Fund which gives a small amount to living goods) all seem rather unproblematic: Deworming programs, vaccinations, vitamin supplementation, malaria medicine and malaria bed nets all seem morally unproblematic.",Catholicism

Question Regarding Dei Verbum and the Historicity of the OT,ShadowAley,1623788909,"Help me make sure this isn't heretical or contrary to church teaching.

So as I understand in Dei Verbum and responses to it, the inerrancy of scripture is **not** limited to just faith and morals but to the entire text itself. Therefore, all scripture is inerrant.  

Please let me know if this statement is alright to say: 

&gt;Inerrancy doesn't imply perfect historicity, as could be the case in Exodus where the author may have embellished some parts of the account, however everything that is included is **supposed** to be included in scripture. All together, it forms the Truth of the account of Exodus. Inerrancy simply implies that while not literally applying history to historical accounts like such, rather that events described did happen while not exactly the way as described, convey a real Truth to the subject. 

Rather, I guess the question would be, does inerrancy imply perfect historicity when describing an account like the Exodus?",Catholicism

Is my view on God wrong?,hereintransylvaniaaa,1623782712,"That's basically my view: 

* God is outraged at every single sin we do, of course, he is more outraged by the mortal sins we do

* Especially now, God's wrath is so much that - if not stopped by the Blessed Virgin Mary - he would end this world, the apocalypse will take place (this is backed up by God being angry at the sins people did at Noah's time, and there was no one to stop God from basically ""resetting"" the world with a flood)

* Because God is perfect, he loves perfection, and this is why we at least have to try to be perfect in every sense - praying in the perfect way, living by the ""rulebook"" perfectly, ... (to stay in the ""Natural/Holy Order"", which is why you can't listen to music with lyrics which are in disagreement with that Natural/Holy Order). But as much as we try, we still will be filth compared to his majesty 

* But this doesn't matter, because by the grace of God, those who try their best will get the grace to come to heaven, but will most likely end up in Purgatory to ""clean their souls""

* You should live everyday so, that it can be used as an example why you should go to heaven. Like: ""What have I done today, which brings me nearer to heaven?"" Basically every second and minute not thinking about God is a wasted minute/second which displeases him

I just can't help but see God as a cosmic tyrant who wants to be worshipped and his rules to be obeyed, because if we don't, we end up in Hell (he's not punishing us, we just chose sin over God so it's the natural consequence). I kind of see, that God has every right to be this kind of ""cosmic tyrant"" because he created us and died for us on the cross to be with him in heaven, so it's like the minimum we could do to thank him. That's my understanding why ""it is ok for God to be a cosmic tyrant"". 

You can treat God as a King, or Kaiser, something with infinite majesty. I don't know if this is some sort of a Stockholm Syndrome, but the same explanation could take place in North Korea, like ""We have to respect our leader Kim Jong Un and live by his rulebook (e.g. only certain hairstyles for men) because he is the one who is keeping our country alive and giving us a place to actually live, without him, the Americans would've bombed us already""

“How do I combat/debate—?”,annahahn007,1623782680,"We get a lot of these posts here. “I’m arguing with some Protestants.” “I’m debating with my parents.” And people come here and look for ways to refute the points made by the other side. I’m going to offer something revolutionary here which is that maybe you shouldn’t get into these debates if you can’t foresee what’s going to be said. Furthermore, it’s a mark of pride to assume you possess the information you need to refute any point that might be lobbed at you. 

I’m pretty knowledgeable about what Protestants or doubters say but even I do not offer to explain the faith based on my own understanding of it because 1) I’ll probably fail and misrepresent something and 2) the Church Fathers, the Doctors of the Church, previous Popes’ encyclicals, and biblical theologians and scholars have done the work for me, often over lifetimes, having studied and prayed for years for the wisdom to learn the faith and put it into words for the faithful to understand. I do not know as much as them. Often all I’ll do is antagonize the person I’m speaking to. 

I understand the drive to get into these debates. I know that, 99% of the time, it’s a desire to evangelize and share the faith. But I fundamentally believe 1% of the time it’s about owning your opponent. I think our faith deserves better than that. 

Here’s what I’d do (and what I actually do when the debates arise, often initiated by another): 

1) I determine if they’re going to debate in good faith. If someone is gonna start accusing me of loving sky daddy or worshipping the BVM, I can tell their intentions right off the bat. In this case, I say, “I won’t have my faith insulted. If you change your mind and want to listen, I can recommend some resources if you’d be interested in watching or reading them.” If they’re genuinely interested, then I move on to number 2. 
2) I find out what their beliefs are. Are they Trinitarian Christians? Mormons? Atheists? “I went to Catholic school so I know everything”? Sola Scriptura? Etc. 
3) I then suss out their vibe, so to speak. Are they bitter former believers? Are they young? Are they feminists? Are they same-sex attracted? Are they Pastor Bob from the Stripmall Church? Are they pro-choice?
4) Once I have all this information at my hands, I politely explain my beliefs, but with passion. I want them to see my beliefs are a matter of faith lit on fire by the Holy Spirit. That alone is often a pretty good endorsement of the faith. 
5) When *they* start to ask questions that I *know* are going to lead to debates, I immediately ask: “If I suggest something to you, will you read it/watch it so we can talk about?” I will choose to recommend either a written source or a video depending on what I sussed out in number 3. Generally, since I’ve been polite and because they can tell I don’t want to argue for the sake of arguing, they agree. 
6) This is where I make recommendations, and where I now invite you to join me in making suggestions in the comments. Below, I’m going to post what I suggest and to whom. I’m hoping you can do the same. 

- I think it’s clear by now that I love Brant Pitre. I recommend him for all Protestants who take issue with the BVM and the Eucharist. His two books, *Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary* and *Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist*, are easy reads and are available in video form on YouTube too.  
- Brant Pitre’s lectures are also recorded on YouTube. I often check his name + whatever point one is making to see what he has to say about it. 
- I recommend Brant Pitre for all believers who aren’t Catholics. I have even had Orthodox friends read his books and they now understand and even believe in the Immaculate Conception. 
- I recommend Brandon Vogt’s *Why I Am Catholic (And You Should Be Too)* to anyone who is atheist or not Catholic but with a weak faith. It’s a quick read. 
- I recommend Fr. Mike to Protestants who don’t understand Catholic worship and theology. “The rosary is idolatry,” “confession is telling man your sins,” etc.? He’s got an answer for that. 
- I recommend the Church Fathers of the early Church to so-called High Church Protestants. Often, just seeing how all Christians were Catholic since the first Pentecost is enough to convert them. Any compilation book is good. 

Some other things: 

- Protestants who are sure they know better than me are often the ones who will read because they want more ammo against us.  It backfires for them. 
- Former believers bitter against the Church won’t respond to much. They want to not believe. 
- I have never been able to get a Muslim to read anything lol. Islam is truly a Marian and Christological heresy. 
- Nothing is as effective as prayer.

Are there some questions I can ask that will help me better assess their position?

Same sex attraction,EliasDomi,1623775095,"Hey everyone,

I hope you are all doing good by the Grace of the Lord 🙏🏻

Society has declared that June is the month of « pride », the month where they celebrate homosexuals and they lifestyle and all its distorted sexual orientation, depravation and all that comes with it.

Being a 23 years old same sex attracted Catholic male myself, I hate the view that society has that all fo that is right and it makes my battle, but also the battle of millions of others same sex attracted male and female, so much more difficult and depressing.

Like I said, I am myself, unfortunately, a 23 years old same sex attracted male and though I grew up as a practicing Catholic, I unfortunately gave in so many times in homosexual encounters with other men, thus making other men sin against God too. I am also a porn and masturbation addict, which I am trying to free myself from. I began my journey of healing after getting in touch with a healed ex same sex attracted Catholic.
Yet, my journey only began, but it is hard and it is hard to go further into it.

Yet, there are millions of people like me that are same sex attracted but don’t want to live in the lifestyle and don’t accept it as a truth.

Now, what would be great and helpful, is if you all might give us your insights and your help to help us battle those attractions.

Like for example : How can we beat our porn and masturbation addictions ? What did you do if you were also addicted and got out of it ?
What can an effeminate guy like myself do to replace his effeminacy with masculine traits and behaviour and kick out the effeminaty ?
How to become more manly and virile in general like straight guys mostly are ?
What to do to go further into our healing journey and not being blocked ?

Etc etc etc

Everything you might tells us, give us, share with us might help us tremendously. Even literature on those topic if you have some.
Sure, I only posted questions about male homosexuality issues because I am a male but you can also share for female homosexuality issues to help female same sex attracted Catholics on this sub ^^

Please, and I really beg you, don’t tell us to live chaste life if we are same sex attracted because that isn’t helpful AT ALL. We already know that we have to live chaste life, but that is for every human being who is not married, and not only for same sex attracted people. And it isn’t helpful at all because it suggest that we can’t do ANYTHING to help our healing from our same sex attraction which isn’t true obviously. Same sex attracted people should always work on changing every aspect of their life that chains them with their same sex attractions and other issues related to this and not just stay like they are, praying to God and living a chaste life without working for their healing and healing is always possible, in different degrees for sure, but still and always possible.

If you need more information about myself, please tell me and I will give them to you !

Trying to differentiate between superstition and signs of spirituality,JoinOrDie11816,1623772421,"I had a tough time coming up with a title. This will be a two part post, part one is going to be my question and part two is what happened to me recently. 

Part One

I’m a young-ish man (32) who has been Catholic (not a great one) all my life. I don’t think I’ve ever doubted my faith but I sometimes find trouble trying to decipher what I feel and what I perceive. It is clear to me that Astrology and Horoscopes et el are fugazi and have no place in the Faith, but how come I feel so at peace walking down one of my favorite streets because of how the trees form endless canopies? MY faith leads me to believe that it’s the Holy Spirit lifting me and causing me to feel lighter than air; others may say it’s Mother Nature or maybe some other Wicca type thing. Perhaps it’s just the feeling of that grand shade and gentle breeze with the sound of the leaves that’s just relaxing. Perhaps not. So what do I mean about having trouble deciphering my perceptions? Part Two offers the details of what happened to me but the question is, at what point do we separate coincidence from “is this a sign from God/Saints”? There is undoubtedly a supernatural element to faith, but when does it go too far? When does it tip the scale to heathenism? 


Part Two
 
My wife and I are preparing to leave for our weekend excursions when she calls out to me from the other room. She exclaims to me that there is a bird in our attic. I go over to the door and sure enough I hear a TWEET! TWEET! TWEET! Quite loud and commanding in my attic. We were almost running late so I decided to deal with it later. I went outside before the rest of the clan and looked up to where the attic window is on the roof to see if there may be a hole or broken window in which they got in from. This is where I see a most dreadful sight. There lie a nest nuzzled under the awning adjacent to the attic window, but the bird was not in the attic. Instead, the bird was trying to arouse a dead chick, that was HANGING from the nest not unlike someone who was hung from the gallows. It was a dreadful thing to see and it left me feeling sick for the entire day. The following morning, I leave my home to start my commute to work and I look up. The same scene as the day before but this time two more birds of a similar type are there along with a pigeon. The pigeon seemed to just be a bystander, the rest seemed concerned for the baby chick who hung there motionless like yesterday. I begin my walk down the road and 4 minutes in, I hear a loud squawk of a bird, sounds nothing like the normal morning song of the birds that are usually around. Suddenly I see a flash of blue and white wisp past my eyes, and I hear the rapid fluttering of wings. The wings of this bird begin to slap me in my neck right below my right ear and I shrug my shoulders up and begin to do a jog to escape. No sooner after the first attack, a second swoop of the same measure, accompanied by a shriek and the same target of my right ear and neck. I then sped my jog up a bit. What in the world is going on? Is this coincidence? Seeing this terrible situation right by my attic with these birds and then being attacked by a bird soon after? Could this be simply a cascade of freakish events? Or could there be some sort of message? I’ve recently started to pray more and then the Bird events took place. My mind went to St Francis of Assisi. Is this just foolish superstition? Or could there be a connection to the faith? Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me in advance. Have a great week.",Catholicism

The church refused to baptise me because I was a bastard,and thus I am still unbaptised today, not because they kept going on refusing to baptise me because of that but just because I wasn’t Christian in the major part of my life (converted in 2019, now I attend mass, pray, read my Bible and try to follow the path of God) but, I am still confused on how they’ve could’ve refused, is it a rare thing?

Prefigurement of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel in 1 Kings 18?,paxdei_42,1623747182,"Hi everyone. I heard that 1 Kings 18:44 is a prefigurement of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, but I'm not sure when comparing different translations:

Vulgate:

&gt;In septima autem vice, ecce nubecula parva quasi **vestigium** hominis ascendebat de mari. Qui \[Elias\] ait: Ascende, et dic Achab: Junge currum tuum et descende, ne occupet te pluvia.

Which the Douay-Rheims translates as:

&gt;And at the seventh time, behold, a little cloud arose out of the sea like a man's **foot**. And he \[Elias\] said: Go up and say  to Achab: Prepare thy chariot and go down, lest the rain prevent thee.

The prefigurement is based on the fact that the cloud is shaped like a foot, referring to the foot of Mary which will crush the serpent's head. However, all of the other Bible translation which are not based on the Vulgate say 'hand' in stead of 'foot', which would lessen the likelihood that this is a prefigurement of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel:

E.g. RSV-CI

&gt;And at the seventh time he said, ""Behold, a little cloud like a man's **hand** is rising out of the sea."" And he \[Elijah\] said, ""Go up, say to Ahab, 'Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.' ""

Freaking Out Over Mary Visions,Bingus-Prime,1623734317," 

Im not sure if this is allowed here but whatever im already pretty lost at this point so why not try it.

So, while just browsing some YouTube there was a religious video about the Vatican keeping a bunch of secret crap (scary by itself wth), anyways in that video was included a segment about Our Lady Of Akita and then the horrible wormhole started and now i am here and terrified of life. So my question is how do others respond to these apparitions, and i know the response of well just mass delusion and they are crazy or liars but that feels the same as saying well its bc god did it like there's no real back up. I guess to me it just seems there is blaring evidence that these things happened and i cannot even start to convince myself otherwise.

Church History — How have we reconciled after schisms?,domesticenginerd_,1623730188,"Hi there!

I am reaching out about church history, more specifically reconciliations between different parts of the body of Christ after schisms?

Some background…

I understand that there have been various schisms over the last 2000 years and that they’ve each been driven by a variety of causes at that point in time.

At the same time, I also understand that we have some examples of post-schism healing and reconciliation / reunification.

For instance, since the schism after the Council of Chalcedon in 451, we have seen several rites unify with the Latin rite (eg the East Syrian Rite reunited in 1553, the Armenian Rite reunited in 1740, the Coptic Church of the Alexandrian Rite reunited in 1741, the West Syrian Rite reunited in 1783.)

Furthermore, the Church of England broke off in 1534 and the Anglican Church was established from the CoE in 1867. But we’ve also seen a reunification with the some of the Anglican churches in the last several decades. (JPII paved a path for unification in 1980 and then the relationship has become stronger since the Ordinate was established in 2009.)

All this to say, I am aware of these examples, but not so much aware of how these things happened and how we ultimately achieved healing and unity. This piques my interest for several reasons, including that if we learn from these examples, we may be able to achieve more healing across the body of Christ!

Here’s my questions:

1) For any of the schism-unifications that you’re aware of, would you please help me understand more about the attempts for unity, what worked, what didn’t, and how we ultimately achieved it?
2) Any recommendations of resources that go over it?
3) Is there anything else you feel like sharing in relation to all of this?

NOTE: I posted a similar post a few days ago and someone provided a bit more clarity on the schism in 451, and I appreciated the commenters clarity. I am still hoping to learn about how these reunifications have happened and I am hoping to learn more this time around :)",Catholicism

Something directly and immediately revealed by God and proposed by the Church as such.

Someone can deny teachings of a lesser level and be a dissenter.  Both are gravely sinful, but only heresy has excommunication attached.  So, as far as I understand it: deny the Divinity of Christ or the Real Presence (transubstantiation) that's heresy.  But support same-sex ""marriage"" or contraception, or dissent from other matters of sexual morality?  Dissenter.

Abortion - Addressing root causes,domesticenginerd_,1623728677,"Hi there!

I am reaching out about abortion. I am very aligned with the Catholic stance on abortion and on the value and dignity of human life from natural conception to natural death.

I am reaching out because I want to talk about the root causes of abortion. This is because as I see it, there are many things that have led to the normalisation of abortion and shifted how our culture views abortion. Some of them are in our control or strongly in our circle of influence, and some of them are less in our control or influence.

For some potential courses of action (like banning abortion at any stage), I can see why that may be a tempting option but I also see how that can further alienate people with alternate stances towards abortion.

All this to say, I have a handful of questions:

1) What do you see as the root causes of abortion?
2) What are you doing to positively influence society (your community or subsection of society) for these root causes?
3) What are you doing politically to support decisions that will help address these root causes?
4) How are you ensuring that you walk with charity, compassion, and respect to those who aren’t yet on the same page as you towards abortion?",Catholicism

"No Mary, No Jesus, No Salvation?",larryjohnwong,1623726345,"Is Mary necessary for the incarnation of God the Son? I've seen the quote ""without Mary there would be no salvation"". But I highly doubt this, because:

The world is not deterministic. We have free will (and it is by Mary's free will and God's grace that she said yes). Even if Mary, the immaculately conceived, has the best chance of saying yes, it doesn't mean that if she said no, another woman who have a lesser chance would necessarily say no. Saying yes or no involves free choice, a mere evaluation of conditions is insufficient to say that no Mary no salvation.

I think a comparable example is salvation. Harry is a very holy person, he is very likely to persist unto the end given his holy life. But he became an apostate at his old age, and he was damned after his death. Barry, on the other hand, was a pagan for decades. He only converted at old age and was baptized on deathbed, and he was saved. Even if we were divinely revealed that Harry was damned, we wouldn't ""condemn Barry to hell"" just because Harry, who has been faithful for ages, was damned. Why would we assume that if Mary said no, the hypothetical ""Carrie"" would say no as well?

And if Christ's mother must be immaculately conceived, what could stop God from creating two women immaculately conceived? The hypothetical ""Carrie"" could also be immaculately conceived by miracle.",Catholicism

Struggling With the Discernment Process,bcrouch1,1623717784,"I am the last person I ever thought God would call to the priesthood. I always thought I was destined to be a musician (a classical cellist and educator), to have a family, and to love Christ in a way that millions of faithful do, but never did I think that Christ and the church were meant to be my whole life. I was sure that, though I loved the church, it would remain a private part of my life that I exercised for myself and those that I love. Never did I think that there was even a remote possibility that Christ would call me to shepherd his people in any pastoral way.
Well, it seems that our Lord had different plans. For the past year, I’ve felt an ever-growing call to serve Christ in a more substantial way. As a stern, but loving parent pushes their children to do things that are good for them, it seems as though God is saying: “Serve me, Ben, and do so joyfully with the fullness of your heart and with the zeal that you give to your music.” The Lord’s call is not sudden; I have felt whispers of a calling every few years since I was very young, but the intensity of His call has never been quite so great as it is now. 
I’m struggling with this process because I am reconciling with the disparities between the life I thought I was meant to have and the life it seems Christ wants me to live. For those of you who have discerned a vocation, how did you deal with these disparities? I feel in my mind that I am meant to live the life of a lay Catholic man with a wife and children. But I dare to say that in my heart, I know fully and without question that God is inviting me to his priesthood. My mind and my heart are at odds with each other, and I feel as though it is pulling me apart. It is painful, and I just want to know what I need to do.
I am dreading the time when I have to make this decision (once I finish my degree, because I can’t afford college seminary). But on the other hand, I am yearning for seminary. I’m finding myself window shopping for cassocks and chasubles. I’m dreaming about hearing confessions and giving homilies. I’m muttering to myself: “Benedicte in nomine patris, et filii, et spiritus sancti.” I’m bellowing the words “Dominus vobiscum” when I’m alone in my car. But most of all, I’m begging Christ to put my mind and heart at ease.

How should I deal with the fear of Hell?,hereintransylvaniaaa,1623713735,"It frightens me that only one single mortal sin can lead to hell. One time masturbating and you are in hell, this is also something I don't get why masturbating is ""equally"" bad as murder (because both are mortal sins which lead to Hell)?

But nevertheless, I am extremely afraid. Sometimes the fear is so great that I start getting anxiety, depersonalisation and panic attacks. It paralyses me thinking about how filthy my soul has become, and I don't know how to wash it

If someone really wants to live in such a way to make sure he'll go to Heaven or at least Purgatory, he must have extreme OCD. Controlling your thoughts (like not looking at women because it's an occasion of falling into the sin of flesh), praying perfectly (like the way we do, so ""it doesn't offend God"") and in general the idea of spending every day to come closer to heaven (to make every day an example of ""why should I be in heaven"")

Basically, if I would have no biological desires (appetite, libido, anger, ...), would have ultimate discipline (to wake up in the night to pray Matins so I can show God how much I am offering up to him) and no thoughts (so no sinful thoughts would pop up in my head), it would be great, the perfect recipe. 

But it's impossible.

I am just mad that the way I look at religion is ""This is a list of do's and dont's"", and not like ""this religion will make you happy and will fulfill you""

So how can I break this? Sometimes if I sin I just say ""Yeah, I know, I'm gonna go to hell anyway so I sin"". It's not that I don't believe that I can be saved, I can be saved, but the path is just too narrow, because the impression I get from our faith is that God wants us to behave in an impossible manner.",Catholicism

"Personally, I'm of the belief that homosexuality is predominantly a psychological phenomena, not biological.",nessiewatcher4lyfe,1623707010,"Maybe this should be flared as politics monday, but anyhow: I was just thinking of how maybe like 10-15 years ago this wasn't so much the case, but today there seems to be the prevailing opinion that homosexuality is a *biological feature*. In fact, laws are passed essentially based upon this premise. Namely, that being ""gay"" is something you're born with, like your skin color or biological sex (the latter being more malleable than we once thought).

Well, I read a quote in a book where the author is listing all the ways pornography negatively influences societies, individuals, etc. The list is very reasonable and also quite voluminous, but most importantly he writes about it after dealing with pedophilia and other such horrid crimes like mass murder. Pornography, he argues, not only leads people into greater sins, but convinces them that there is nothing wrong with their sins, even if those sins are committed against children. When such a person chooses to engage themselves in a sinful lifestyle, they end up in the violent hands of Satan.

Today, children are exposed to pornography even on TV and billboards. I would even argue on the street with how womens' fashion is these days. . . People think this is okay, -apparently-, and we all know that some state approved medical experts have even advised that viewing pornography, masturbation, as well as homosexual activity or gender dysphoria are psychologically/biologically normal behaviour. With that kind of disingenuity, why should we believe what their science says about the origins of homosexual inclinations?

In a society where pornography is so widespread, so easily accessible, so depraved and barely held accountable, how can any information in regards to sexual behaviour be trusted? Perverse special interest groups like NAMBLA and the Rene Guyon society have sought to normalize pedophilia under the premise that sexual violence committed against children is not harmful to them. . . this is insane! ! !

Well--what other lobbies are at work seeking to normalize homosexuality or gender dysphoria? It would appear the whole world! ! ! Even Target has homosexual manaquins on display! Yet these are fundamentally activities which, like pornography, when indulged in just lead to deeper sins.

The Catechism of the Church says, *""\[Homosexuality's\] psychological genesis remains largely unexplained."" \[CCC 2357\]*

Psychological is the imperative word. The Catechism says nothing about biological genesis. In fact, when viewed in the light of biology, homosexuality does seem like an unnecessarily cruel burden, and you see that in a lot of posts online, (""Why was I created this way? etc"") Of course, heterosexuality seems the same way at times, truth be told. . . But I do wonder whether same-sex attraction isn't a product of nurture instead of nature. Fact is: no person is born a thief or a murderer. Due to original sin we are all predisposed towards sin, but this is just a matter of probabilities, it doesn't define us.

Habits, according to John Hardon in the Catholic Dictionary, ""*add to nature by giving it ease of performance, where the acts intensify a habit and the habit facilitates the acts. Habits of acting are acquired by constant repetition, and lost by disuse or contrary acts. Good moral habits are virtues; evil ones are vices.""* So looking at society, we have created a world which is by-and-large exposing children to sexual violence, whether through pornography, peers, or worse, sexual assaults by adults. Then, simultaneously, we have a culture which is saying that all this is permissible, if not vocally than submissively by staying silent on issues *like* pornography or *homosexuality*. So wouldn't this reinforce the vice of homosexuality in a young person and make it seem as if this were something they were born with?",Catholicism

(I will refrain from the details, unless it is important then I can DM specifics) When I woke up, I was wet, meaning I had an orgasm in my sleep. Obviously, this was unintentional.

So I began wondering, did God send me this dream to show me the pleasures of the flesh and encourage me to get married and procreate in his honor? Similar to how God sometimes sends us signs and hints of what awaits us if we turn ourselves sober to his grace. Or did the devil send me the dream to tempt me into fornicating in these countless lustful ways in the physical world? Similar to how the devil may divert us from our path to God.

A related question, I assume that my involuntary orgasm does not count as masturbation, since it was out of my control...but did the fact that I enjoyed the feeling when I woke up mean I have sinned? And I only supposed to enjoy an orgasm with my spouse?

Last year I was working as a junior financial advisor, in a small 2 partner shop in Maryland. One of the partners was my cousin, who also happens to be my god-mother.

We have our house in MD on the market, and this has done what seems to be irreversible damage to my family. I am in my 30s, so at this point the role of God parent is more symbolic.

Obviously the simplest answer would be ""in your body"", but it's just mind-baffling that you literally can experience a whole new world just by sleeping.

Another question would be: Where does your soul go if you are sleeping, but not dreaming? Or if you are having an anesthesia?

Is your soul literally ""switching worlds"" when dreaming/anesthesia? Because theoretically, if we die, we instantly know that our soul is not on Earth anymore but either in Heaven/Purgatory/Hell. But that's not the case if we sleep but without dreaming or having an anesthesia

I am just having difficulties how ""having a soul"" and ""(lucid) dreaming/dreamless pitch-black sleep/anesthesia"" can exist all together

PFML and the RCAB,gacdeuce,1623689509,"I mostly just need to vent and this is somewhat related to politics. I’m from MA and back in 2019, the state passed a law that requires employers to offer paid leave for both fathers and mothers when a child is born or adopted (it also covers a few other circumstances too, such as the care for a sick spouse or parent). The cost for this comes primarily from an additional “contribution” on the employee’s paycheck. Schools are not exempt, but religious organizations are. This went into effect on 1/1/2021. I have just been informed by my employer (a Catholic school) that no such leave is offered because it falls under the umbrella of the Archdiocese of Boston. Upon further investigation, the diocese is “looking into a private option for the future” but has no paid family leave plan currently. 

I can’t help but express how frustrated I am that the Church, which claims to be pro-family and pro-life, would neglect such an accessible and benign way to provide for new families.

[Politics Monday] Contemporary American conservativism is imploading and frankly I don't know where to align myself anymore.,CumbiaConLaLuna,1623687798,"Between mainstream Republicans who are a shell of what once was a decent party and the 'grassroots' internet conservatives I see whose views of what is truly conservative or traditional varies so widely there really can't be a legitimate voter base, I have no idea where it's a headed or what the objective of a contemporary conservative is. 

It's basically an open secret the Republican establishment protects corporate interest leaving me to wonder, whose protecting the middle class? The conservative notion of trickle down economics sounds good on paper but in reality is a total failure by my estimation, at least in the major corporate world, small businesses may be another story. 

What bothers me most though isn't the progressive Catholics but rather the total acquiescent attitude of almost all Western Catholics to liberal (in the proper sense) ideology. Republicans gained control from legitamite monarchs through unjust wars, i.e. Colonial Revolution, French Revolution, and so on and replaced them with far worse regimes, which now today, Catholics, even traditional ones, have no issue with how the modern world has set itself in place by taking what wasn't it's in the first place.

Frankly I'll never be a well informed voter, I have too much activity in my personal life to go out of my way and research each and every issue and come to a proper conclusion about it. Nor do I think it out to be the average American's responsibility to maintain such a task. Furthermore it doesn't really matter that much when I'm not the one in office calling the shots.  

I think liberalism, both conservative and progressive forms, are in the end a failure. A nation can't maintain a secular federalism and keep the people beholden to it's true constitutional intent without another binding force. People will ultimately take too much liberty with it's (the constitution) rhetoric unless another institution binds them to the constitution's cause, and that's where the Church comes into the mix and why I don't believe in the separation of Church and State.

I need some guidance if someone has had a similar experience,Krustycook,1623684908,"I posted something about this in AskAPriest, but was hoping to get a little more input from folks here.

I have been a Catholic all of my life.  However, my path has been a rocky one.  My mother was very religious, but married my father, who was a divorced Episcopal.  Though they had a good marriage (both have since passed), it led my mother to be estranged from the church and me along with her.  After my first communion, I attended mass rarely until adulthood.  Before I got married, I decided I wanted to be Confirmed.  I was Confirmed about 20 years ago now and my wife and I have raised our 2 children as Catholic (my son was just confirmed).

Throughout all of this, and even today, I have been conflicted in my faith.  I would say I have acted as a Catholic should (or, more correctly, have tried to) without ever feeling that I had a personal connection with God.  I have gone though the death of both my parents and my only brother without feeling that connection and without ever hearing his voice.

All of this is prelude to the following... last week God spoke to me for the first time.  I had been getting my elderly father-in-law out of a bad living situation.  One night before going to sleep, God told me that he had put him in my path.  When I say ""God told me"", it was as if someone said something to me without my remembering hearing it.  But I know it wasn't coming from me.  I have had an epiphany before.  This was different.  And it was followed by a brief vision of Jesus when I closed my eyes.

I have been reading a lot and talking to my Catholic friends about it since it happened.  Rather than giving me a good feeling, it fills me with terror.  Not because God has asked something of me.  But because I am hearing his voice now.  Why now?  It has somehow made the loss of my family hit me even harder.

The most common advice I've been given is to talk to my local priest.  I do like him as a man and I like his masses, but he is not someone I have felt a great connection with.  Past conversations have been brief and/or surface.  I would not say he ""knows"" me.  So while I will speak to him, I believe I will still be left with many questions.

Has anyone else had something similar happen?  If so, what recommendations do you have on exploring this.  Bless you all for your help.",Catholicism

"I'm heading for my first Mass, and happy that my faith journey lead to this point. :)",Quekksilber,1623684401,"Edit as I come home:

This was an evening mass in a small church. It's the only one in the city I live in, and it's homely and modest. There where about 12 people there of all ages, and half of them where in my age range (20). I live in a quite secular region of Germany, and if you meet Christians, they are normally Lutherans, so that was unexpected. ;)

&amp;#x200B;

I very much enjoyed the peace and reverence of the place, the people, and the celebration itself. The Pastor is a great singer and a lively, vivid person. He's not ""just going through the motions"".

During the Mass I was a little bit overwhelmed by all of the liturgy - but that was fine. I didn't expect something else. I look forward to the day when I can speak all the prayers from the heart, because then I think I can enjoy the liturgy more, but today it was a little bit hard to keep up. :) Thanks to the Lord I had an inner peace the whole time.

At Communion I went forward and crossed my arms.

After Mass I went to talk to the Pastor for a couple of moments - he was very forthcoming, and explained some fundamentals to me. He also showed me where I can find the structure of the liturgy in the hymn book, and I could borrow one. He also invited me to join RCIA (or at least an equivalent to that) which will start in the fall.

&amp;#x200B;

After all, it was a good experience. I imagine that meeting Jesus for the first time was similar for the disciples. Kind of unfamiliar, new, maybe with questions like ""Did I do this right?"", but still at peace and in a community of people who are united to you in a profound way.

I have grown up Christian and went to Sunday services pretty regularly, but this was still new to me.

Babies at events?,TheKingsPeace,1623683097,"One thing I like about Catholic events is how “ baby positive” they are. Young married couples ( at least at my parish) do feel welcome/ encouraged to bring their littlest ones along.

Yet Even in the inclusive Catholic environment their seems difficulties with the bringing a baby. 

If a mother/ father have a baby that they have to hold that might limit their ability to socialize/ know others. A baby is quite needy and in need and isn’t exactly conducive with cocktail hour. Depending on its age, I’m not sure the baby itself could be that happy at an event with a lot of strange people/ sounds and perhaps hot weather.

I was recently at a barbecue and saw a young Catholic couple with a baby that couldn’t have been more then 2 months old, it was so small and sleepy.

They had him/ get outside with sun. It seemed difficult to socialize and care for baby effectively .

6. Better hobbyist

Intercessory Prayer,Anglo_Hermit,1623681230,"Someone over on the Debate Religion sub posted a rather lengthy (and largely ahistorical) diatribe about the Catholic/Orthodox veneration of Mary being little more than recycled pagan goddess worship. Most of these arguments are easily refuted as they're largely based in revisionist history and ignorance. However, someone posted the following that no one has answered. I thought I would post it here to see what your responses would be:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;God can hear us.

So why pray to anyone else? This is exactly why God gave the First Commandment:

Exodus 20:3 King James Version

3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

Praying to anyone else is treating them as a god. There's zero excuse to pray to anyone other than GOD. Period. You're fooling yourself if you think this is acceptable.

&gt;Praying to them is not magic, divination, or necromancy because we are not attempting to use any satanic or supernatural means to communicate besides prayer, and because it is a one way communication. ""they are what is called “Familiar spirits,” to which are demons."" Here I either understand you wrong or you don't understand what demons are, or what I meant. **A familiar spirit is a contracted evil spirit or demon**. When we communicate with our loved ones through prayer, we are communicating with their souls. Same with when we pray for the Saints or Mary.

You realized that you agreed with me in the Bold right?

I think you are mis-understanding what Familiar Spirits are, this quick article will help you: [https://www.gotquestions.org/familiar-spirits.html](https://www.gotquestions.org/familiar-spirits.html)

And this Article: [https://bibleask.org/what-does-the-term-familiar-spirit-mean/#:\~:text=What%20does%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Cfamiliar%20spirit%E2%80%9D%20mean%3F%201,the%20dead.%20...%205%20Seeking%20God%E2%80%99s%20Word.%20](https://bibleask.org/what-does-the-term-familiar-spirit-mean/#:~:text=What%20does%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Cfamiliar%20spirit%E2%80%9D%20mean%3F%201,the%20dead.%20...%205%20Seeking%20God%E2%80%99s%20Word.%20)

To further highlight:

Ecclesiastes 9:5-6 King James Version

5 For the living know that they shall die: **but the dead know not any thing**, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.

6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.

Again, if you contend that those who are in Christ, and are dead, are """"Alive in Christ,"" thus, are not ""Dead."" You are mixing the Physical Living/Dead with the Spiritual Living/Dead, to which are very different things. First, to be clear, Necromancy is trying to communicate with the Physically Dead, which includes those in Christ, as those in Christ are at Rest. I''ll post it again since you seemed to ignore it before:

For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. **There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.** Hebrews 4:8-10 - [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage?search=Hebrews%204:8-10&amp;version=KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage?search=Hebrews%204:8-10&amp;version=KJV)

They perform no other Works, no Labor, not intercession... Nothing, because as per Ecclesiastes says, ""**the dead know not any thing**,"" So the Bible is perfectly and Abundantly clear, The Dead do nothing, and to attempt to reach them is Necromancy, simply because you are attempting to contact the Dead (physically Dead).

&gt;You are also misunderstanding the use of the term ""graven image."" A graven image would be an idol. **Not literally any image.** You might have noticed that right after that commandment was given, Moses was instructed by God to create an image of a bronze serpent. The bible isn't that contradictory as to have a huge contradiction within a few chapters.

First of all, let's be clear what Graven means:

[https://www.thefreedictionary.com/graven](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/graven)

verb

1. a pp. of grave 3.

adj.

2. deeply impressed; firmly fixed.

3. carved; sculptured: a graven idol.

[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/graven%20image](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/graven%20image)

Definition of graven image

: an object of worship carved usually from wood or stone : idol

Have you noticed yet that I give you direct evidence from Scripture and Real definitive evidence, and you only give me opinion? I don't get how you think you are right? It's delusion.

Second, God had Authority to do justly and appropriately, therefore he can give direction on how to do something at his request. So it's not contradiction for God to ask Moses to create the Bronze Serpent. Quoting from an Article, ""God was teaching the people something about faith. It is totally illogical to think that looking at a bronze image could heal anyone from snakebite, but that is exactly what God told them to do. It took an act of faith in God’s plan for anyone to be healed, and the serpent on the stick was a reminder of their sin which brought about their suffering. The image was kept for many years. Many years later, when the Israelites were in the Promised Land, the serpent became an object of worship ([2 Kings 18:4](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Kings%2018.4)). This shows how easy it is for us to take the things of God and twist them into idolatry. We must never worship the tools or the people God chooses to use, but always bring the honor and glory to God alone. he next reference we find in the Bible to this serpent is in [John 3:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%203.14). Jesus indicated that this bronze serpent was a foreshadowing of Him. The serpent, a symbol of sin and judgment, was lifted up from the earth and put on a tree, which was a symbol of a curse ([Galatians 3:13](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gal%203.13)). The serpent lifted up and cursed symbolized Jesus, who takes away sin from everyone who would look to Him in faith, just like the Israelites had to look to the upraised symbol in the wilderness. Paul is reminding the Galatians that Jesus became a curse for us, although He was blameless and sinless—the spotless Lamb of God. “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” ([2 Corinthians 5:21](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Cor%205.21)).""

Again, God has authority to direct and provide Signs and Symbols... like the rainbow. Do not confuse this as it's ok for man to then use a symbol, as man does NOT have the authority to do so. Look at all the Scriptural evidence, and you should clearly see it. If you still can't, then you have no one to blame for your misguided belief in praying to Mary or ""Saints,"" as I've clearly shown to you it's wrong and an abomination to God.",Catholicism

They said they were concerned because they saw that I was supposedly becoming increasingly extremist (that's because today we arrived late at morning mass and I decided to go to evening mass just in case; they saw that as an exaggeration). They also said I don't seem like a happy person, that I needed to relax and give in sometimes because I seem too tense (I am scrupulous so trying to show the image of a happy person can often be difficult). Because of all of this sometimes it can be really difficult to try to be a good Christian (I fear bad reactions to fraternal correction, tell them about activities I plan to do related to religion, etc.). So my question is how can I become a better Catholic in these circumstances, and how can I get my family to become more curious about the faith and get on the right path.

Best friend's getting an abortion,fried_mushroom,1623643934,"Hoping for no judgement here. 

As the title explains it, my best friend (non Catholic) got pregnant out of wedlock and is getting an abortion. 

I've tried to support her as much as possible. We're in different countries so that's not the easiest, but trying my best to be there for her through the pregnancy, communicating with baby daddy who isn't the best, offering to pay for counselling and help financially when the baby is here etc. Yet she is decided on terminating. 

I'm not a strong Catholic. I've never felt anything against abortion. But now that's it's this close to home- I am so hurt and burdened. I want to stop the abortion but I've done everything that is within my power. The guilt of not being able to stop this is eating me up and I'm feeling like the biggest sinner in town. 

I don't know what to do with these emotions. I don't know how to continue supporting my best friend especially now when she needs me the most. I don't know what I'm looking for from here, but what do I do now?",Catholicism

Forgiveness Vs Sweeping under rug,ALC8915,1623639377,"I really struggle with the concept of Forgiveness. Long story short is that I had an argument with someone close to me and they were “wrong” and have refused to acknowledge the hurt they caused me even though I calmly explained it and asked for an apology.   I was flat out denied.

In previous incidents I would just pretend the wrongdoing never happened.  It would never be discussed again and I would move on and the other person would continue to do hurtful things because the weren’t willing to see they hurt me the first time or because they didn’t see any consequences.

I read Matthew 19 21-35 and what I got from it is that we are to forgive others the way God has forgiven us.

Not sure I can do it anymore.,SanantonioRose2,1623639021,"24 years since my conversion, I'm at low ebb. Unlike a lot of people, I don't find the abuse scandals to be contradictory to faith (any human group with people of disparate power in close proximity = sexual abuse) and I don't have any problem with the sexual teachings of the Church. And, I don't have any particular problems regarding liturgy. Sure, some Catholic music is lame, but otherwise I pretty much like Mass from any missal.

What is troubling me so?

Contradictions.

I've been witness to a lot of annulment proceedings and even participated in some. When I was a fresh convert, I told many, many people ""It's NOT a Catholic divorce!"" Now, two decades later, yes, it is a Catholic divorce. Not theologically, no, but practically, because my diocese, your diocese, apparently every diocese in the western world, abuses it. I've seen some shit, if you'll excuse my French. I could go into details, but those details all coalesce into ""Catholics can and do get the Church to approve of a civil divorce with ease and regularity. They are made to wait about a year, which feels like a penance, and then they receive their decree, literally no matter the facts. My diocese, which is in the United States and you have heard of (but is not San Antonio), has not had a verdict of validity in anyone's memory on the tribunal.

Think about that. Nobody, even priest-judges who have been working on the tribunal for decades, can remember a case being judged valid.

The one that broke my camel's back was a friend whose wife started counseling with a tribunal judge about how to ensure a verdict of nullity (Roman-Rota-proof) even before the couple physcially  separated. It was sick and twisted.

I have watched all this and it caused me all the pain of cognitive dissonance, and then I had an epiphany:  The Church gives people what they want. It has for a long time.

The western world wants easy divorce? Catholics got it. It's got a bunch of window dressing, but with a 99+% guarantee, divorce was delivered to Catholics through a revamp of the canons and the tribunals.

Same as contraception. 99+% use it without any trouble from the Church. Just like usury went away when the western laity started banking. Just like capital punishment is going away now that it's unpopular.

Meanwhile, do you want to be told that divorce is impossible, contraception is a mortal sin, usury remains a sin, and capital punishment cannot be prohibited? No problem. You can find that at a Latin Mass parish an hour's drive away. It all co-exists.

At the end of the day, nobody can say what moral teachings of the Church are actually irreformable. Because nobody can really say anything definite about any of the truths in the hierarchy of Truth except that the dogmas cannot change, although you can have a merry argument about how many irreformably defined dogmas there are.

So, what started as me being witness to horrible, widespread abuses of the annulment system has led to a deep fracturing of my faith in the Church as a sure guide. I look around I see sheep scattering everywhere. I watched with fascinated horror a few years ago as Catholic Answers, an organization which had fed me a lot of the information necessary for my conversion, basically melted under the pressure of ambiguous and contradictory output from Rome. They quit and were fired and stealth edited documents and basically looked like a bunch of idiots, all because they had gotten used to treating all moral teachings are irreformable simply because they had not been reformed in a while.

This is just part of it. I also, over the past two decades through typical personal medical challenges of the type any family faces, have come to see that practical Catholicism is hopeless for explaining tragedy. Why did the child die in the car wreck? That seems a basic question which a religion would have a clear answer to, and that answer would lie somewhere on the continuum between ""God willed it"" and ""it was a car wreck, God had nothing to do with it"" but the actual perverse truth is that ALL possible answers are acceptable within Catholicism and you WILL get each and every one of them if you ask enough priests. You can be a deist or an occasionalist, and nobody knows or cares.

I have become convinced, through observation, that two priests in neighboring parishes are, quite often, teaching completely different religions with contradictory fundamental theologies concerning the nature of God, His will, and the source of evil, but they offer the same sacraments, so it's all good.

I also no longer believe the hagiogrpahies. I delved deeply into the story of my cultural/ethnic saint, and it's pretty clear to even a casual investigator that he never did those things. I won't say who because others may have an important devotion to him. But my saint is far from the only one like this. The amount of pure fiction and make-believe mixed in with history is, to me, problematic for a religion of truth.

And I cannot swallow Humani Generis, but that gets really technical and maybe 4 people on Earth care.

I'll stop here and see if anyone wants to discuss. It's OK if no one does. It's just nice to type this out for once. I'll keep working on it.

What are your thoughts on the Mysteries of the Holy Rosary? Do you pray with or without the Luminous Mysteries?,pearlsnvodka,1623629756,"I’m a pretty fervent devotee of the Holy Rosary, I try to pray a full one every week. It’s hard with ADHD but I do my best. I don’t go ANYWHERE without one. So even if I can’t focus well enough to actually pray a proper rosary I am still always holding one and praying in my own way.

As a liberal Catholic I’ve recently been looking at some more traditional Catholic books and resources, even the Douay-Rheims Bible which I now surprisingly love, and have come to realize the numerical significance as to why for hundreds of years there were **15** Mysteries. I have to say St. Louis de Montefort made me have this realization.

This has made me start to question why the Luminous Mysteries were added. I recognize that they are important facets of Christ’s life that are worth pondering, but why add them to what was already a perfect devotion?

The original 15 Mysteries x 10 Hail Mary’s per decade = 150 Psalms, which is what the Holy Rosary was intentionally meant to replicate. This 150 number isn’t divisible by 20. It drives me crazy. Sure, we could add 5 more Mysteries to even things out again, but why?

I do know that Pope Francis is devoted to the image of Our Lady of Silence (I love her too) and I have a tract that has five proposed Mysteries of Silence. Okay, that would get us back to multiples of five but again, is adding them really necessary?

At times when I am feeling contrarian and bitter I think this was done just to sell more books and related materials. I know it’s wrong to think that—but while I’m being honest with my thoughts I may as well be totally transparent.

So I’ve been asking myself what my position on this is, since (as far as I know) the Church has not stated the Luminous Mysteries are authoritative. Every resource I’ve seen just says they are “recommended”. But you cannot find books or pamphlets or anything with only the original 15. I found a used copy of the classic Scriptural Rosary book with the original 15 but that’s the only one.

I’m a big fan of St. Paul John Paul II—he was Pope for my entire childhood and early adulthood and was a remarkable man. I have good memories of him from growing up and he made me a Catholic. But I’m starting to question why he added these new Mysteries and whether or not I really need to pray them in order to be considered truly devoted to Our Lady’s Rosary. 

Hopefully this skepticism doesn’t offend anybody, I just like to see all sides of any given issue. And it helps strengthen my faith when I have **thoroughly** considered a subject. I’m interested to see people’s thoughts in favor and in opposition! I’m leaning one way right now as to whether I do or do not want to continue using them but totally open to new insights and opinions.",Catholicism

"Given their unique and profound gifts from God, why are Catholic parishes so routinely out-performed in terms of growth and making people feel welcomed by Evangelical Protestant fellowships?",EyeTappaKeg,1623622056,"There's a wonderful old 1000+ seat  movie theater on the road from my house to my very historic Catholic  parish here in Catholic land (California.) A bit more than 2 years ago, a  brand new Evangelical Protestant fellowship began renting it on Sunday  mornings. They had created a ""church.""

At  their beginning, as I was walking home from early Sunday Mass, there  would be a small handful of people scurrying around 90 minutes before  their service began. Many, many times I would stop and help them unload  heavy folding tables and chairs from a van at the curb in front of the  theater. The feeling of TEAMWORK in those 5-10 minutes was palpable.  They were immensely thankful -- always offering me a cup of coffee, and  seemingly in awe that I was a Catholic Christian already on my way home  from Mass at 08:30.

After several  months they no longer really needed my help as they clearly had plenty  of new recruits. They've always remained friendly and call me by my  first name as I pass by. I attended their service once. It was fine --  rather ""Christian Lite"", but fine. Communal prayer, plenty of singing,  great sermon and a fairly serious coffee social that followed. Overall a  rather joyous and dignified experience.

Now  that limitations from the pandemic are easing, their growth rate seems  to be accelerating strongly. They now have two services each Sunday!  They also have a couple of older shuttle vans that drop people off to  their services.

I asked their  pastor in passing if they were going to buy their own building? He  laughed and said no. Apparently Sunday morning rent at the otherwise  empty theater and Wednesday night rent for their Bible study at the  local IOOF Hall is very reasonable, and any money they collect goes to  maintaining their vans, for outreach, etc.

In  contrast, my Catholic parish (and all I have attended) feel more like  ""sacrament processing stations"" on Sundays. Cold, impersonal, get them  in and get them out. Priests sometimes ""calling in"" Masses, priests who  are seemingly very anxious to bolt as soon as they are complete, despite  no huge time demands on them on Sundays. Ultimately parishes that ever  so slowly seem to be dying from an attendance standpoint -- much like  many Mainline Protestant denominations.

What's  the reason for this contrast? I've tried to talk to other Catholics  about this, but pride (and often a dearth of logic) get in the way. ""BUT  WE ARE THE CHURCH CREATED BY JESUS CHRIST!"" ""BUT ONLY WE HAVE THE  FULLNESS OF FAITH!"" ""BUT WE HAVE THE EUCHARIST!"" ""BUT THEY DON'T HAVE  ALL THE SACRAMENTS!"" ""BUT THEY ARE HERETICS!""

**So  very true!** Awesome gifts from God which would suggest the Catholic Church would ALWAYS be outpacing Evangelical Protestant fellowships! Yet  that's not the case in my experience. It's almost as if we take God's profound gifts for granted, and use them as an excuse to coast.

Why  exactly is that? Why isn't more effort made at least on Sundays to  offer the Mass in a more solemn, more dignified, less hurried manner?  Why don't more Catholic parishes offer opportunities for genuine  fellowship before and after Sunday Mass? Why don't more Catholic  parishes provide a shuttle service for those without transportation? Why  don't Catholic parishes do all the things that Evangelical Protestant  fellowships do to make people feel welcomed? To make them feel like they  are part of a community?

Sadly  when Catholic parishes do attempt to be more inviting, they often do  precisely the wrong things. They introduce inappropriate, secular music  into the celebration of the Mass. The Mass becomes ""come as you are""  with some attendees wearing truly unfortunate garb. The focus often  becomes an attempt to shorten one's worship experience (a very  long-standing tradition) at Sunday Mass, rather than to make it more  richer and more meaningful. The list goes on and on. None of this is  common at the prospering Evangelical Protestant fellowships I have been  exposed to.

**I've never really heard any truly, logical, introspective comments from Catholics (particularly clergy) on this matter**. **Usually their focus is on attacking** either the person who dares to ask such questions, or **the Protestant fellowships who seem to be doing so well**, or ridiculous rants about Mass forms.

It's also not uncommon for some to construct false zero-sum games when talking about this subject. An example would be **""I go to Mass to worship and not to drink coffee!"", as if one activity precludes the other. Such nonsense.**

I  realize this is a very complex problem with many facets, but it's  getting sadder and sadder to witness the Church's inability to adapt and  improve at the parish level, at least around here.

Contraception to prevent a dangerous pregnancy,godzillaguy9870,1623618036,"I recently got into a discussion with a friend on FB about the use of contraception in cases where another pregnancy could kill the woman. She believes that the Roman Catholic Church's teaching that couples should abstain from sex in such cases is an unfair burden for these couples that would cause them to be devastated or live in despair, and is not what God intended for marriage. The point that it is the ""Roman"" Church that demands this is important, since she says she knows several Eastern Catholic women who have been in this position, and whose priests (who are good and holy men) have told them to use contraception in this case. She says that the Roman Church is the only one that does ""not offer  any merciful bending of rules for the spirit of the law over the letter."" And that the Roman Church gives a unique burden to such couples, ""claiming in one breath that sex is essential and unifying and in the next that those who desire it are selfish for wanting it without wanting to die,"" a burden not given by other Catholic Churches.
(She also thinks that Rome doesn't respect the Eastern Churches as Churches and demands that the East obey Rome in order to be in communion, despite the East's ancient traditions.)

I of course mentioned NFP, but she says that NFP doesn't work for all women, and there is a big overlap with women for whom NFP failed and women who would be killed by another pregnancy. She says this teaching is killing women.

(She has also brought up in the past that Humana Vitae was published despite a huge lack of support from many leading bishops and theologians.)

While I do submit to the authority of the Church in the end, and I have my own responses to these issues, (everyone has their own crosses, we are called to die to self, also Eastern Catholic priests are wrong in counseling thus, etc) I must admit I am moved by her arguments. (There was yet more and I obviously paraphrased.) I do ache for couples in such situations. Is it unfair for the Church to demand a couple live in abstinence for the rest of their life in these instances? Should there have been some more leeway in Humana Vitae for such extreme instances?

About children,Fabulous-Cat-860,1623615273,"I got married before converting. Husband is a cradle catholic but doesn't believe. Always thought we'd have kids but now he's 90% sure he doesn't want kids. Various reasons, his experiences and financial issues.

I want to have children when we are in a better financial position - but  ..  what if I don't? Will I go to hell for being married and not having children? I'm trying to be open to life.

Could God have made us differently?,Uninterrupted-Void,1623615217,"For example, it seems at first glance that God could have made any of us with different traits: eye color, hair color, stature, skin color, or whatever.

But since in Catholicism, we are a unity of body and soul, you start to wonder whether this is even definitionally possible.

So we have 2 options:

1: God could have made us with different traits, and different natures, but they would still be us.

2: If God made us differently, it wouldn't be us at all, and this is therefore inconceivable.

Edit: A good friend of mine on reddit told me Aquinas is not magisterial so he doesn't have the final word, but I say he's a good philosopher so his ideas may be a good place to start. Aquinas had something to say about this, but in his paper he was not just talking about different but ""better"". Here is the summa article, and I'd love to discuss it if anyone would be willing to.

Walking By Faith,496us1,1623613624,"By Deacon Tom Caso  

&amp;#x200B;

If you think back to your school days, you will recall that you had textbooks loaded with facts. But those textbooks alone were not enough for you to learn. You also needed a teacher that could lead you to think – to take the facts from your textbook and apply them to the world. The teacher helped to form your brain.

Jesus had a more difficult job. He not only had to get the people to look at the world in a different way. Jesus also had to form his students’ hearts. The right way of thinking was not enough for someone to change their lives. His students needed to change how they saw themselves in this world and how God is working in their lives. 

To change hearts, Jesus used parables. He did not just give a set of rules. He wanted people to think about what He was saying and then to allow that contemplation to work on their hearts. Today, we are Jesus’s students. We need to ponder the parables and let them change our hearts. In that contemplation, there is now room for the Holy Spirit to work and we are open to listen to Him. 

In today’s Gospel, Jesus is talking about the Kingdom of God and telling us that we are not going to notice how it grows. Even the tiniest seed has the capacity to grow into something important. We just have to trust God that His plan is in motion. As St. Paul tells us, we have to walk by faith.

But here is the challenge. In the first reading, Ezekiel likens the coming Messiah to a majestic cedar that provides a place for everybody to dwell. What then is the mustard seed if Jesus is the majestic cedar? Are you the mustard seed that God has planted? Will your small actions have great effects in the world that help the Kingdom of God grow?

It is not enough for us to just believe and pray. We need to act like we are disciples of the Lord. We need to let Him guide us to do our part to build His Kingdom, whether that is by sharing our faith with a co-worker, feeding the hungry, or just showing kindness to a stranger. Today, you are the mustard seed. Your smallest actions can have tremendous impacts.",Catholicism

Arriving very late to Mass,CalculatorOctavius,1623607681,"
Today I arrived very late to Mass but it wasn’t my fault. I went to the Church earlier than usual, but I saw that the nave was populated and a mass was going on so I went to wait outside. The Mass has been at 12 PM for a long time now. After a while I went back and it was still happening so I asked someone what was going on and they told me the mass time changed to 11:30. I was not aware of this, and the sign outside the church was not updated, it still said 12PM. 

So I was 30 minutes late, and I went in as the offertory was taking place. I still received communion because being late was not my fault, and I quickly googled whether it was okay and the first result was a blog site of a priest saying is was fine. 

So I just want to make sure I didn’t commit an offense by receiving the Eucharist despite arriving just barely before communion was offered. 

I really hope they will update the sign because this kind of situation can cause a lot of stress and possibly ruin someone’s entire week, especially if they depend on the grace from the Eucharist each week",Catholicism

Is Catholicism is compatible with vegetarianism?,FreehandBirdlime,1623601001,"Non-Catholic raised by a cultural Catholic family (the ""Mass on Christmas and Easter only"" type) here. Something I've always wondered about was my family's reaction to the few years I spent as a vegetarian in college. According to them, vegetarianism is a sin because of two things: God granting us dominion over animals, which means we have carte blanche to do whatever we want with them (""go read Genesis again, you have a lot to learn""), and also because it's ""against the food chain,"" which means I was shunning God's natural design and order for things, which they interpreted as me thinking I know better than God. But really, all I'd wanted to do was reduce the total amount of suffering I caused, and I was even quiet about that part, just saying I was doing it for health reasons if anyone asked. I didn't hold it over anyone's heads. I just quietly didn't eat meat. 

I didn't think much of it at the time because there are so many things I've always been told (rightly or not) that the Church permits that I find morally wrong, but this one just popped into my head for some reason, and the more I think about it, the more I just can't make the logic hold up.

Why are missals so complicated and how do you set them up and use them properly?,CalculatorOctavius,1623599642,"I’m talking about the TLM missal.

Summa Theologiae,Greedyyy21,1623599483,"hey guys, i was reading summa and in the first book, on the person of the father, article 4, in reply to objection 3 ([https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1033.htm#article4](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1033.htm#article4))  


He says:  


 **Reply to Objection 3.** According to [**Damascene**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08459b.htm) **(De Fide Orth. ii, 9),** ""unbegotten"" in one sense signifies the same as ""uncreated""; and thus it applies to the [**substance**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14322c.htm), for thereby does the [**created**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04470a.htm) [**substance**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14322c.htm) differ from the uncreated. In another sense it signifies what is not begotten, and in this sense it is a relative term; just as negation is reduced to the genus of affirmation, as ""not [**man**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm)"" is reduced to the genus of [**substance**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14322c.htm), and ""not white"" to the genus of [**quality**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12589c.htm). Hence, since ""begotten"" implies relation in [**God**](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm), ""unbegotten"" belongs also to relation. Thus it does not follow that the Father unbegotten is substantially distinguished from the Son begotten; but only by relation; that is, as the relation of Son is denied of the Father.   


He makes a reference to St. John of Damascus's book 2, chap. 9 (An exact exposition of the orthodox faith) but I can't find an explanation related to ""unbegotten meaning uncreated"" in St. John's book. it's not in book 2, chap. 9... does anyone know where it is?",Catholicism

Who would truly deny Christ?and pray for the dead.,DependentShirt8089,1623592475,"I’m learning about the afterlife and judgement and these things.  It seems heaven is for those that fully accept Christ and his will, purgatory is a place for people that may still have some attachments but are saved, and hell is for people that completely deny Christ.

My question is who would deny Christ once the truth has been revealed?  I can’t imagine people saying no if they actually knew.  I can see people thinking believing isn’t rational and that God isn’t real, but who would straight up deny once the truth is told?  Even from a secular level if I was presented with two options mirroring heaven or hell, who would pick hell?

Everyone’s understanding or conviction of the truth is different.  I’m a cradle Catholic that has always been taught and knew the truth.  Some of my friends think Christianity is a waste of time, but they also come from a family that never went to Church.  Surely they aren’t denying Christ?  They just don’t know any better.  And I can’t see how they’d deny him if the truth was ever presented fully to them.

Lastly of note. I heard a story a while back about a priest that has long been dead visiting a particular rectory.  Apparently he would show up in his clerics and ask for people to say a Hail Mary and then disappear. Please take a second and say a Hail Mary for him.  I’m convinced he’s in purgatory.",Catholicism

- Is it just to worship God and to not work at your job?
