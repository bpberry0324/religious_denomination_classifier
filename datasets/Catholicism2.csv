Thinking about making a deal with the Devil to get myself a Wife.,SpaceGhost717,1623577133,"I am thinking about making a deal with the Devil so I can find myself a suitable woman to marry and then marry her.  I know the Devil has the power to make that happen.  I will also include a stipulation that she will never divorce me and if she dies I will receive another woman who will be my wife.

I am going to keep following God in the meantime, but if I have little to no luck with women in the next year or two I will try to make a deal with the Devil.

How do I go about making a deal with the Devil?  Do I just pray to Satan and ask for what I want in return for my soul?",Catholicism

Is it ok to go to a Newmann Center for church if I am no longer in college?,Vivid-Poetry-2954,1623570635,"So, I moved to a new area and have been looking for a place to go to church. The issue I am running into is it just seems like the only people going to my local churches are older people who are retired. Now, I don't have a problem with those people.

But, I would like to at least have SOME people closure to my age (I am in my early 30s).

The only place that appears to come close to what I am looking for is the Newmann center near a college campus. Well, I didn't go to that college nor am I in college anymore. 

Would it be ok for me to go to that mass or attend events there? I guess I just feel like I have no place in the Catholic Church anymore. 

Either you are retired and a bunch go to those churches. Or, you are a college age student in early 20s and then I wonder if I am even supposed to be going to the Newmann Center or if that is viewed as ""strange""?

As I sidenote, I feel strongly this is a reason why many are leaving the church. They don't really feel that they have a place to belong with fellow Catholics there age (people in there mid 20s all the way to mid to upper 30s).

Anyways, wanting to go there but don't want to come off as some ""weirdo"" going to a college mass when I am in my early 30s and don't attend that college, but live nearby. Not that I much care about what others think I guess anymore (although I do in the moment sometimes), but seeing this is church, I would like to be respectful of whether I should go or not is all.

Thanks for any information.",Catholicism

Sinful life,Consistent_Raccoon89,1623567818,"I lived a sinful life after high school, approximately 10 years. For a long time I felt lost and recently, approximately the past 6 months I've started to become a practicing Catholic once again. 4 months ago I went to confession, first time in years, and it was a real struggle just to enter the church after so long. My issue is that I am not sure if I confessed all my sins and I am more concerned about any mortal sins I could have forgotten. Any advice to this? After entering the church and confessing my sins I really felt God calling me back home and it feels great. I now attend church every Sunday, pray the rosary everyday, and I plan on going to confession every 1-3 months. Went again a couple weeks ago with a long list that I did forget to confess. Unfortunately I did stray off from the church and I'm ashamed of it but there's always that thought of did I forget to confess a sin that was a mortal sin?

But I get the felling that if they only knew what it was then they would tell me to confess it and I have just been worried/ kinda scrupulous about it so I was going to ask one of those same priest agin. (This particular priest is probably the closest thing I could call a sprital director but even at that its just me asking a question during/ after confession) so in line I was horrified because I didn’t know what to say and didn’t want to say it but was trying to prepare myself to say it (and cry) if he changed his mind I guess and but I was getting so nervous that when I stood up I felt like I was going to fall over. But when I got into the confessional it was a difrent priest. One that I realy don’t know and is hard to talk to because of his very thick accent. So I just read off my sins and didn’t ask about it.

Until a few months ago (I'm 14) I thought religions were just a silly way of explaining things and a tool for manipulation through the centuries. But I have always been interested in history, rather in World War II, and through some YouTubers (Papacito) I was interested in the Middle Ages, and I started to tell myself that science was not that a means of explaining created by this so believing and magnificent civilization for which a number of men died, defying death because they knew what awaited them in the hereafter.

Reasons why I want to convert,PsalmistBob,1623541288,"I've posted on this sub-reddit before about some questions I had, but after prayerful consideration and research, I’ve decided I want to convert from Lutheranism to Roman Catholicism. I have my reasons for this too. 

My first reason is because I’ve been persuaded by the arguments supporting and defending the Papacy. Moreover, I find the Lutheran arguments against the Papacy to be inadequate. Therefore, I’ve embraced the Petrine interpretation of Mt. 16:15-19 and understand Isa. 22:21-23 as a prefigure to the Papacy. Furthermore, I understand Jn. 21:15-17 as reiterating St. Peter’s role as the Vicar of Christ. Consequently, I’ve accepted Papal Primacy and Supremacy.

I believe then that Christ established his Church not only upon the confession of Simon son of Jonah, but also on the very man himself whose name was changed to Peter to demonstrate this. More importantly, I believe St. Peter and his successors were endued with the charism of infallibly to specifically decree dogmas via ex-cathedra. This has kept the Church unified as Christ prayed for and promised. 

My second reason is because I now consider Sola Fide to be wrong. The only time in Scripture whenever the words, “faith” and “alone” are present in either a reputable formal or dynamic equivalent translation, the word, “not” is there as in Jas. 2:24. Therefore, I must conclude an individual is justified by grace through faith expressed in charity. I know this is a vast oversimplification of the Catholic view of Justification, but I am still learning. 

My third reason is because I now consider Sola Scriptura to also be wrong. I’ve been convinced that nowhere in the Bible does it explicitly claim for itself to be the sole authority for the whole Church. Rather as 1 Tim. 3:15b implies, it is the Magisterium that adequately dedicates doctrine and practice whilst utilizing both Scripture and Tradition. This harmonizes seemingly contradictory passages such as 2 Tim. 3:14-17 and 2 Thess. 2:15.

So it is these three reasons why I want to convert from Lutheranism to Catholicism, which is more sophisticated, historical, and biblical. But does all of this sound right with Catholic Theology? I’m asking because tomorrow after church, I intend on asking my pastor for a talk about changing denominations later in the week as to be respectful to him. I know I will need to reach out to the local Catholic Church in our area afterwards and request to speak with their priest about this in order to begin RCIA.",Catholicism

Question regarding Neocathecumens,crorockycro,1623541216,"First of all I would like to say that I made fake account for this post. Secondly, sorry because I don't know if I am breaking any rules of this sub and even if this is question for this sub. And thirdly, this will be a long post.

I am writing this post because I really don't know anyone that is part of this way and I am not really comfortable to speak with someone I know and ask for suggestions.

I would like to say that I come from very catholic family and I think of myself as good, not great, but good example of catholic. 

I met this girl few years ago, at college (disclaimer - she lives in one town, I live in different town, and we go to college in 3rd town) . We were in same company and somehow started texting and seeing each other (you know how that goes).
Not long after I thought she really is my type (and I still think this) because we have much in common. Of course, we started dating.

Don't know if this is important but she is my first girlfriend because I never found anyone on the same wavelength as me even though I was semipopular in highschool 😅.

Not long after we started dating, she told me that she really wanted to save for marriage (abstinence). At first I didn't know what to think about that but I agreed with her decision even though it was hard for me.

Since we were in different town (studying), I really couldn't notice anything different in her catholicism since at that town - our college town (for what I know) there is none neocathecumenal community. We went to church together every sunday (and we still do). 
Once when she was at her town during some kind of school break, she told me that she would be unavailable for few hours (Saturday night) because she went to church. Okay, it was a bit weird for me but I know there can be numerous of reasons. I asked her about that and she told me that she and her family go and celebrate mass in some type of ""old christian way"" altough she didn't tell me the name of the community.

Because we are from conservative families, we waited kinda long before we went to eachother towns (because that would mean that we would meet each others families). She came to my place, everyone liked her because she is really well mannered and good person, I went to her place and same thing goes for me.

1st time I was at her place (we kinda go to eachother once a year since we have really tight college schedule) she went to that saturday mass without me (I kinda had bad feeling about that, don't know why) but ok, she went, I didn't.

Next year when I was at her place she was kinda bummed all saturday and I remembered that she likes that and I suggested that we should go to the church that night, why not. 
We went there and first thing that was weird to me is that they don't have mass in church, but in some lets call it basement below church. There was maybe 20-30 people (low number considering that on Sunday masses there are hundreds of people) and they had different type of mass. There was one part where after the reading from Bible, gospel? I guess. (it is kinda hard for me to explain since I know names of the mass parts only in my native language, not in english) every member that felt need could talk out loud about parts that struck them most, and talk about personal matters that bothered them. Also what was weird to me is that they all bowed to the priest, and since I was altar boy for 7-8 years I know that priests and us bowed to the body of Jesus Christ that was present in hosts (I think it is called host and not wafer?).

Okay, it was different than what I was used to but I went over it because of her. I finally found out name of the community/way and it was called Neocathecumenal way.

My main problem began when I actually saw how much her family (especially her mother) were invested in whole way (I couldn't notice that any sooner since we see each other families once a year) and only after that I started google-ing it.

This post is already too long for me to explain Neocathecumenal way so If you want to know bit more google it.

There are lots of confessions from people that were on/in the ""way"" with a lot of negative stuff - especially from my country. I read about it and it kinda seems like some kind of a cult more than a catholic way.

There are some stages for each participant of the way that thay had to go through, they have some kind of public confessions where they ask one person that sits in some kind of chair all sorts of questions - That person needs to tell their biggest burden - for example if wife sits there and she has some kind of sexual/marriage problems and her husband is sitting with other people, she has to confess her burden and be shamed by other members of community for her sins or something like that.

I had some kind of mini argument with girlfriend in which I said that I would never in any way like to be participant of that community even though they are Christians. Her biggest defense was that they are recognised and approved by the pope. We all know about the Legion of Christ and Marcial Maciel and pedophile scandal even though they were approved by the pope.

I wrote this post because, once again, I came to her town (and to be more clear, when we visit each other we come for few days only, it is not month long visit), she, that same night that I came, went to church with her sister with message to me and I quote ""I must go there tonight"". Not ""I want"" but ""I must"".

She went there, I stayed with her dad (he is cool guy though) and she was there for 4 hours, and it was one of those confession nights. She couldn't skip it or something because of me (that may sound selfish but I really think it is not).

I know that I need to talk with her about that, and I will for sure because it really bothers me. I read that a lot of members of that community can neglect their spouses or children because of ""the way"" - that is why I think I am not selfish. If she can put that over me, I know we are just boyfriend/girlfriend, she goes to Church, it is important, but if she can do this now, she could do the same thing once we get married.

We are together for few years now, we still love each other, her family loves me, my family loves her. I could imagine rest of my life with her (this is cheesy, she is my first girlfriend and I know breakups are really hurtful - I kinda semi experienced that and would never let myself down like that again hopefully, but I really think that she is great) And that is why I really, really don't know what to do in this situation.

I really don't know why I even wrote this, I just felt need to write this somewhere where someone could maybe understand me and tell me more about this ""way"" and deepen my knowledge about it because, how things stand now, I don't have good opinion.

Sorry for any writing and grammar mistakes, I am not native english speaker.

My wife and I worked through most of the studies from [Walking with Purpose](https://walkingwithpurpose.com), which while marketed toward women are reasonably theologically deep with background while focusing on group discussion.

Small rant, but I’m struggling because every scripture study I find is deeply academic, examining the history, early church, and church doctrine while not really focusing on how you apply that scripture to your own life. They’re just dry and not what I’m called to be studying right now.

The ideal scenario (based on WWP) here is working through a few verses each day, with several discussion questions that might include looking at other scripture &amp; Catechism references and inferring connection and then exploring your own thoughts and application on the topic. My wife and I work through these over coffee each morning. We’ve studied John, Hebrews, and several other intermixed topics over the last year but don’t have any more to explore from the publisher.

There are plenty of Protestant bible studies that follow this format, but I find them lacking in the sacraments and other teachings of the Catholic Church and would prefer to stick with Catholic commentaries. I had [asked previously about one on Revelation](https://reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/m9dw9e/recommendations_for_a_revelation_bible_study/) without much luck, and I’ve expanded my search to any books of the Bible.

Any suggestions on more practical, less academic Bible Studies?

Converted to Catholicism from Islam (kinda..),Plenty-Site-3879,1623533184,"Good evening my Christian brothers and sisters. Just converted to Catholicism a few weeks ago. Basically, I’m a Muslim guy from the Hejaz, literally 18 km away from Mecca. Grew up to realize the god worshipped in the Quran is literally all about fear and control. Literally every single thing about our life is controlled through this religion. Growing up in America I used to always wonder why would god create all these decent loving people I grew up with  just for them to burn in hell for eternity? While literal human scum like Bin laden would go to heaven just for believing in Mohammed? 


The way Islam treats our sisters is simply ungodlike. Various moral issues in Islam coupled with extensive research showed me Islam is literally no more legit than Mormonism or Bahaiism and that really hurt me. To see Mohammed literally use 7th century Syriac Alexander romance legends in his Quran and call him an Islamic prophet really hurt me.(imagine thinking Alexander the Great was a Muslim prophet lol).To see various early 6-7th century Arabian heretical gnostic belief in Islam really hurt me. To know that this obviously false religion my entire family believed was the literal word of god really led me to atheism. Hell I don’t know what I believe in tbh. I just know that I love Jesus Christ and his message of love and compassion. Catholicism to me, while I may not be 100% convinced by it, is the most comforting religion to me and my personal life. I cannot live as an atheist anymore. I feel like my life is devoid of purpose, and Christ helps fill that void. If anyone can help an ex Muslim dude strengthen his Catholic belief, that would very helpful guys. Thank you and god bless ✝️",Catholicism

I wanted to share this quote with you.,Dr_Talon,1623527913,"I've been reading the excellent [*Faith Comes from What Is Heard: An Introduction to Fundamental Theology*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1941447546?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details) by Catholic theologian Lawrence Feingold.  On pages 17-18, he gives a quote from Dominican scholar Marie-Joseph Lagrange which I feel compelled to share with you:

&gt;If religion has any meaning, it indicates relations with God.  The aim of religion is to draw us closer to God, and the most perfect religion is that which draws us closest to Him.  When the union is such that the mind cannot conceive anything more intimate, we have attained, I think, the final degree of perfection in so far as man is capable of attaining thereunto.  Our religion proposes to our belief that God united Himself to the human race by the Incarnation, that having become incarnate He unites Himself to us in this life by the Holy Eucharist, and that, while further uniting Himself to us by grace, He offers us union with Him in glory by penetrating into the very vision of His inscrutable nature.  The impossibility of any further ""religious progress"" stands out clearly from this simple summary of religious teaching.",Catholicism

"Has anyone ever run into people who's stance on religion is ""why does it matter"" or ""I don't care to think about it""?",MrMcGoofy03,1623524596,"I've met a decent few people who's attitude towards religion was extremely apathetic.

Now what I mean by ""caring about religion"" isn't going to mass or anything. I mean caring about *whether a religion/God(s) exists or not.* 

I can understand if someone believes they have good reason to think that God does not exist and then after that to not really engage with the topic again. But what I cannot understand are people who just never bothered to put thought in it either way or who think that it's not a big deal.

Questions of ""Does a higher power exist"" ""is there a true religion"" ""is there an afterlife"" etc... by their very nature should be to any rational person one of if not the most important questions. For the answer to these could mean you have a vastly different eternity.

Most people of all walks of faith at least ask these questions. Some unfortunately reach the conclusion that there is no God and become atheists or agnostics. But at least they actually thought about religion and cared enough to come to a belief (or lack there of). But to just not care in the first place bewilders me considering what is at stake.

I've also noticed that this sort of an attitude has been growing in recent years. Have any of you guys met people with similar view points (well technically a lack of a view point)? What do you think is the cause of it?",Catholicism
Baby’s Liver and the Rosary,kmeem5,1623524542,"At my son’s 15 month checkup, the pediatrician tells me that that his liver felt abnormal.  She told us to come back 2 weeks later to follow up in case the abnormality was just due to a current infection. We came back and she checked his liver again and said something was wrong. 

In the upcoming months, the baby was subjected to several blood draws. I remember sitting at Quest Labs and hearing him scream because the phlebotomists couldn’t get enough blood or had a problem locating a good spot. The baby kept getting pricked.

Each time, the results indicated a liver abnormality. This sank our hearts. He was only 15 months.

I prayed the rosary throughout but each time the results showed abnormal. But I kept praying and asked my husband to join in. I asked our Christian Brothers and Sisters for prayers as well.

The pediatrician referred us to a children’s hospital- one that focused on serious cases. She, like us was hoping it was just due to a small infection but the labs kept coming back abnormal so we had to see a specialist. She used to work for that hospital and had a high reputation for taking care of kids.

Stepping inside the children’s hospital, I saw parents bringing luggage in for kids who has to stay for awhile and my heart sank. The hospital focused on the worst of the worst cases…and I did not want to be there— not my kid.

My husband and I took the baby up to the specialist. I had my rosary bracelet on me and was praying the whole time. I remember telling God “Your will God but please if you can, he is only a baby please let him be okay.”

After checking in, the receptionist asks me to pick a random card from the box.

“We don’t call patients by their name here for privacy reasons. So we will call you by the card you pick.” She said.

The box of card contained locations from all around the world.  I randomly picked the middle card. And gave it to her without looking at it. She gave me the card back.

The card said “Rome” and it had facts about the Vatican.

I felt chills and showed my husband the card and said “I think he is going to be okay.” But my husband  was lost in thought which I don’t blame him as there were sick kids being strolled pass us in wheelchairs and with their sticks that had bags attached to it.

Baby underwent X-rays and then we were went into a room to wait for the specialist. He looked at the X-ray then checked the baby’s liver.

He looks at us and says “He is absolutely normal. There’s nothing wrong. The X-ray shows that the liver is fine and I don’t feel any abnormality.”

I pray as much as I can now, during bad times and especially during good times.

My go to, being against it, is about how we go about ending their suffering, by means of murdering them, and how the ends dont justify the means. 

I'm just wondeing id there is anything else I can say, as emotions run very high in these situations.

Anyways here is what she sent me:


""New to this thread...the quarantine led me to read the Hartley thread, the Mama Nails thread &amp; the Jaxon Buell thread. Damn...

This may be a bit of a powerlevel, but back in the early to mid 1980s, my mother's cousin gave birth to a baby who had some sort of severe disability. The name of it escapes me now. Anyway, for a year and a half, that baby lived and knew nothing but suffering and pain. Every moment of the poor thing's existence was agony. His parents didn't keep him alive with extreme measures, no resuscitation or anything like that, he just kept living. And then he died. It was a relief to the entire family that the poor thing was no longer suffering.

A few years later, my mother's cousin got pregnant again. Naturally, she was worried about the condition her son had had and the doctors ran tests. And she was devastated when they told her that without a doubt, 100%, this baby had that same condition. They didn't say ""terminate the pregnancy"" in so many words, but it was presented to her as an option, considering how far along she was.

She was heartbroken. She lost her son, now her new baby was going to have the same thing. Being raised Catholic, she went to her priest, who had known her since she was a child &amp; supported the family throughout their ordeal with their son. After listening to her, he reached over, took her hand &amp; said ""I know what I'm suppose to tell you. But I also know what you and your husband went through. And I saw what your son went through. I think, in this case, it would be far more merciful to send that child to God now then for it to live it's entire life, however short, on this earth knowing only suffering. You will answer to God later, but I think, in this particular case, He would welcome your child into His arms and He will forgive you for wanting to spare your child all the pain.""

So....yeah. I don't understand how people can call themselves Christians when they knowingly have children with such profound disabilities and it's very possibly they live in agony and are unable to call out for help or relief. It's selfish, to get the asspats and the ""You're so brave"" comments from others than for any real concern for the wellbeing, quality of life or care for their child.

Church History - Uniting after Schism,domesticenginerd_,1623508597,"Hi there!

I am reaching out about church history.

I understand that there have been various schisms over the last 2000 years and that they’ve each been driven by a variety of causes at that point in time.

At the same time, I also understand that we’ve seen some post-schism healing and unity.

For instance, since the East-West Schism in 451, we have seen several rites unify with the Latin rite (eg the East Syrian Rite reunited in 1553, the Armenian Rite reunited in 1740, the Coptic Church of the Alexandrian Rite reunited in 1741, the West Syrian Rite reunited in 1783.)

Furthermore, the Church of England broke off in 1534 and the Anglican Church was established from the CoE in 1867. But we’ve also seen a reunification with the some of the Anglican churches in the last several decades. (JPII paved a path for unification in 1980 and then the relationship has become stronger since the Ordinate was established in 2009.)

All this to say, I am aware of these examples, but not so much aware of how these things happened and how we achieved healing and unity.

For any of the schism-unifications that you’re aware of, would you please help me understand more about the attempts for unity, what worked, what didn’t, and how we ultimately achieved it? If you know of any solid resources that go through it, would you please share that too?",Catholicism

O Lord, eternal and merciful loving God, 

You are my rock, my stronghold. 

I submit myself to your divine will and pledge eternal obedience to your perfect and infallible plan for mine own life. 

Show me thy will - that which ye didst compose as thee built my soul from nothingness - thy plan for my life which thou declared shall be consubstantial with my flesh and my soul.

Shall I be a priest like Melchizedek of old?

Let me not squander that declaration for the temptation of thy flesh or for the seductions of thy cursed demon.

All these years, St. Joseph was there, but only now have I realised that he is my spiritual father, and I am his spiritual son. For this reason, I am seriously considering adding his name to mine on my consecration day (8 July - please pray for me) as many add Mary's name to theirs after consecrating themselves to the Blessed Virgin.

To get to the point, should I add St. Jospeh's name before my middle names or after them? I feel very strongly that I should add it before my middle names to give St. Joseph greater honour, but I would like to hear your thoughts.

"questions on ""offering up suffering"" and ""reparations to the Sacred Heart of Jesus""",songbolt,1623465879,"On the morning of 11 June 2021 EWTN encouraged us to offer our suffering to God for a particular intention to receive graces as well as to make an act of reparation to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.[1] Would you please explain both of these?

1. I am tempted to think, “God is in heaven letting us suffer, wanting us to suffer, refusing to help more unless we offer this suffering to Him.” This seems contrary to the Gospel yet what is implied by your instruction that God will give us more grace only if we offer our suffering to Him. Could you please clarify?

2. Doesn’t the Church teach that Jesus is in heaven, perfect as God, and now with a glorified body? What does it mean then to ‘repair’ his heart? How can Jesus be injured or broken if He is in heaven and God, who we are taught is not subject to change? I think Hebrews 11 even says that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So what does it mean to say that Jesus’ heart is in need of reparation?

Thanks and God bless.

Rev 12:1-2 A new Layer of Meaning,Dan_Defender,1623460015,"'And a great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery.' - Rev 12:1-2

Yes it is the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Yes it is also the Church.

But here is another layer: it is the constellation Virgo aligned with the sun and the moon. This is a rare astrological event, but it happened in the year 3 BC, so this passage may point to the date of the birth of Christ. If that is so, then the death and resurrection occurred in 30 AD. That means, it occurred exactly **40** years before the destruction of the Second Temple and Jerusalem. 40 is a significant number in the Bible:

Moses was on Mount Sinai for 40 days and nights, on two separate occasions. The prophet Jonah powerfully warned ancient Nineveh, for forty days, that its destruction would come because of its many sins. Ezekiel laid on His right side for 40 days to symbolize Judah's sins.

Elijah went 40 days without food or water at Mount Horeb. Jesus was tempted by the devil not just three times, but many times during the 40 days and nights he fasted just before his ministry began. He also appeared to his disciples and others for 40 days after his resurrection from the dead.

The children of Israel were punished by wandering the wilderness for 40 years before a new generation was allowed to possess the promised land.  The first three human kings over the children of Israel, Saul, David and Solomon, each ruled for forty years.

God flooded the earth by having it rain for forty days and nights. After the patriarch Jacob (Israel) died in Egypt, the Egyptians spent forty days embalming his body.",Catholicism

As this day comes to an end, I thank you for all the blessings you’ve given me: the food on my table, the people around me, the clothes on my back, the roof over my head and the great gift of being alive.
As I pray tonight, allow me to lay before you what’s weighing heavy on my heart these days. You know my worries God, you know every single thought that crosses my mind and my anxious feelings that never seem to go away.
Father God, forgive me for only giving you my worries and my broken self for you to heal, but you know how much love I hold for you in my heart, and as soon as I reach a period of calm and clarity, I’ll be able to offer you all of me and make the best of the blessings that you will soon put upon me.
My sweet Jesus, help me surrender to you, let go and trust you. I know you have a plan for me, even when things look tough, but I’m your daughter, and the world is full of daughters and sons waiting for a hint of a blessing from you my Lord.
I am in strong need of a miracle in my life, and I know that no one but you can give me this kind of gift, you’re the God almighty, creator of the universe and the souls that grew to love you very much. Jesus, please lay your eyes and love upon me and sort out every issue in my messy life.
I ask you tonight to listen to our hearts as you always do, and to speak to us in any way, to hold our hand and guide us to your light, to be our eyes in a universe that lost its love and warmth.
God, you created my heart, please listen to what it has to say when my words fail me. I trust you Jesus, and I love you with my whole heart and spirit, more than anything else in the world.

Wives would do well to learn a few fundamental principles in dealing with men:

Give him his meals on time.

Cook him a real he-man meal. Don't make him diet because you are on one.

Fold the paper up again in its original state after you have finished giving it the once-over before hubby gets home.

Never touch his razors or pipes.

Never reprimand a waiter or waitress or be too fussy with them when you go out with the lord and master.

Never talk about his relatives--in fact, try always to praise his mother and father and even his dopey sister.

Don't get on the telephone when you know he is coming home, waiting to eat, or ready to go out.

Never call him at his office or place of business. (Except if Junior has swallowed the egg-beater.)

Don't kiss him when you have on fresh make-up.

Don't argue over unimportant things.

Don't ask him to carry parcels that would stagger a coolie.

Don't start discussions at breakfast.

Don't give away his things without asking him. (That old brown hat is his prize possession.)

Don't go with him to pick out his clothes unless he expressly asks you. If he comes home with a green plaid suit, praise him for his individuality.

Don't give him a list of things to lug home from the store on his way from work.

&amp;#x200B;

And here are a few good rules for husbands:

Never butt into the management of the kitchen and the children.

Never say her hat is crazy. Praise her for her unusual headgear.

Don't complain about the junk in her purse. Think about your own pockets.

Don't keep telling your wife to ""step on it"" when she is trying to do her nails or pour herself into one of those new dresses. You'd be all thumbs then, too.

Don't forget her birthday or the anniversaries. (The same goes for her parents.)

Don't pass remarks about her girl friends.

Don't stay at a party when you can see your wife is uncomfortable or bored. Take your cue from her when to leave.

Don't neglect to compliment your wife often on her beauty and efficiency. It works wonders.

Remember she loves attention. In public, really turn it on. Help her off with her coat, stand behind her chair until she is seated. Order for her. Light her cigarette. Look interested in what she is telling you. Just remember that women love attention. Pour it on!",Catholicism
"[Free Friday] Does anyone keep a journal, log, or diary?",elmcityslim,1623433304," Does anyone keep a daily journal?

As my uncle is getting on in years, he started to share his daily journal/log with the family (he always shared excerpts here and there but now he really keeps it open). His journal writing began in the early-80's and he had the foresight to keep a ledger or index of topics and people. So, for example, do I want to read any journal entry that involves my mom? He will Just look up my mom in the ledger, which points to the volume number and page number. When there was a lot to write about, some days took up multiple pages and when there was little to write about, some pages contained multiple daily entries. But he hardly ever missed a day, even if he just said: 

&gt;I had the flu. Thus, I ate crackers and soup, took a shower, watched ""This Old House"", and helped my poor dear wife clean up my vomit. Because of my mess, I missed the part where Norm was explaining how to install a new cabinet.   
&gt;  
&gt;Friday, April 17th, 1992

So my question to anyone here is, what do you write about? I was listening to an older episode of the podcast ""Pints With Jack"" and what the host said about the journals of C. S. Lewis was something along the lines of ""you notice a change in topic as Lewis moves from atheist, to Theist, and finally to Christianity. He becomes less introspective, looking into himself. Lewis started looking outside more, first to his neighbor and ultimately to God."" I want to train myself to be less introspective and focused more on God and all of His creation (other people, and the world outside). I made another post about this recently and I think a journal might be a good way to approach ""letting go of the self"". As an aside - Also on Pints with Jack, the hosts tend to write a few Haikus based around the episodes topic. That seems like a great daily goal for a journal!

Trying to understand cannabis arguments,CalculatorOctavius,1623429945,"
Most catholic apologists say that marijuana is always sinful even if it’s legal, because it intoxicates the mind. I heard a guy on catholic answers say it’s different from alcohol because alcohol is an intoxication of the blood whereas weed is an intoxication of the brain. Well maybe I was misunderstanding him, but what I wrote just there is nonsense really, both of them are of the brain. 

And the comparison usually goes, that it is sinful to become drunk on alcohol too, and that the problem with weed is that you want use it without getting stoned. But that’s definitely not true. Anyone who has ever used it on a regular basis (I have a long time ago, but I don’t do it anymore nor have any interest) knows that you can take 1 or 2 small hits of a joint and you get an effect similar in intensity to that of 1 or 2 beers or 1 or 2 glasses of wine. Enough to feel the pleasant effects without becoming inebriated. 

Based on how they talk, it seems many of the apologists don’t have experience with the stuff, which I guess is a good thing if it really is sinful. 

But I am having a hard time seeing how it could possibly be if someone does it in a place where it is legal, and doesn’t become stoned, if alcohol isn’t.",Catholicism

One night as I was praying and having a particularly hard time with some people in my life (due to how “crazy religious” I was becoming), I prayed specifically to feel the presence of the Holy Spirit to give me strength. It’s very difficult to find the words to explain the sensation, but I 100% know that it was His presence I felt a moment after. I went from kneeling to feeling almost like I was levitating, but there was an energy throughout me. I felt no longer like I was a body and soul, but just a soul. Yet at the same time united to the Spirit. It was so profound, it left me weeping in utter love and awe. It lasted around only about 4-5 seconds, but was the most powerful sensation I have experienced to this day, even after witnessing visual miracles as well.

[Free Friday] Hey you. Read this series,emptyyellowbowl,1623427615,"I'm pushing the limits of what ""community building content not related to Catholicism"" means.

I just finished a fantasy series called Realm of the Elderlings and phew, PHEW. You don't even know. It's 16 books comprised of 5 trilogies/1 quadrilogy, written over 20 years. I started the series in the 90s when it was first published and just finished it last month and it's truly a masterpiece of the genre.

I hate summarizing books, especially fantasy books, they sound so cheesy, but here goes. In the first trilogy there's a boy who goes on a quest to find Elderlings to ask for their help in defeating an enemy. The next trilogy we learn a little more about what those Elderlings really are by exploring different characters in a different area of the world. The third trilogy we're back to the first set of characters and they're helping the prince get married and helping the Elderlings with a quest of their own. I'm doing a bad job of this, aren't I? The characters are extraordinarily well written, the plot is woven quite tightly, the magic systems and religious systems are absolutely believable - like, I'd quit reading and have to adjust to remember that Elderlings don't exist in real life.

I'm recommending it here for Catholics to discover for a couple reasons.

**Based**. I wouldn't say there's zero feminism, per se, since there's non-explicit fornication, a ""marriage oppresses women"" character, female soldiers, etc but they're merely plot devices or non-descript background characters or quirks of the culture, not obnoxiously written agenda-pushing nonsense. 

**Based**. Most of the series views homosexuality with horror and it allows the male friendships to flourish beautifully. Homosexuals and transgenders on the internet insist on forcing homosexuality onto some of the characters (I saw someone say that because the author is so homophobic, a particular character was ""too scared"" to come out to her. These people are insane.), but I assure you that a plain reading of the text along with the author's own comments negates that view. That said, a homosexual relationship eventually gets written in.

**Allegory**. Some plot points weirdly emulate Jesus's story. And because it's so well-written and cohesive, it's hard not to treat the books like a biblical text and find links and prophecies between the series. To be clear, it's not meant to be a Christian allegory, but it feels familiar in that way. 

**Virtue**. The characters are explicitly driven by sacrifice, service, family, nobility, suffering. A lot of characters themselves are named for virtues.

Oh, the books are as follows:

However, there seems to be a point where we ought to draw a line. Maybe only informed by personal conscience, I grant. For example, I did some digging into amazon.com a few years back and came to the conclusion I did not want to support a company that engaged in such poor treatment of its employees and in unfair (and frankly illegal) practices in regards to its competitors.

Mixing Christianity and new age practices,theotokosprayforus,1623418652,"I have a couple of family members who mix Christianity and new age practices.

They believe that Jesus is Lord, but also that mother earth is a spirit who can help you, and that the law of attraction is real. They also believe that hinduism and eastern religions can bring people to God, who manifests himself as Jesus for us westerners, but he can be experienced in different gods. They all believe in astrology as well. 

It's very confusing for me because with this one cousin, we pray together once a week and she really does proclaim Jesus as Lord and Saviour. She also reads the Bible everyday and prays daily as well. My cousin said she was going to do an indigenous mushroom ritual to connect herself to the universe... She said that the colonizers wiped out our beautiful spiritual practices (we are from a country that was colonized by a catholic power). Now this is concerning for me. She told me that ancient Christians and ancient Jews took psychedelics, and how everyone should use it to truly experience God. She doesn't like catholicism because she said it's so legalistic and has so many rules and because of its colonial legacy... She said we should just focus on loving Jesus and sharing this love with everyone else and spreading good vibes. 

Anyway, I've been praying for my cousin because I'm scared that she's trying to attract negative forces into her life, while thinking she is becoming more spiritual and closer to God. She claims that she has seen the Truth due to her psychedelic trips and she says things like how you can find God in yourself.

I have controversial opinions on Catholicism (18 F),hedgehogfanatic,1623399618,"Hey guys, I’m an 18 year old girl who grew up in the Catholic faith. Sunday school, baptized, first communion all that. My entire family had been Catholic for hundreds of years. I believe in God and Jesus and believe that God helped create the universe. But I’ve been called out for having non traditional Catholic views and called “sinful” etc for the following views, and I was wondering if anyone could discuss them with me.

First off, gay marriage. I support the LGBTQ 100% because God makes everyone exactly how they should be, and many claim the Bible is against homosexuality when the word homosexuality was actually first added in the 1930’s. 

Second, I believe pretty much everything in the Bible, although I think some of the older stories not involving Jesus are closer to morals then real stories. 

And 3, I don’t think everything in the Bible was written for modern day people. For example: women shall not wear braids or wear men’s clothing or eat fish on a certain day or have sex before marriage. I think in our modern day society a lot of these rules don’t work. For example, in Jesus’s time dating wasn’t a thing. You would know them for a bit and get married after a month.

One concern my wife and I have is having our baby grow up in a good church community.  I grew up Presbyterian and really value the strong faith formation I received in my Sunday schools and youth groups. Our church had lots of events and opportunities to build community. 

My wife grew up Catholic and basically had none of that.

As a girl I find it so difficult to be humble and not care about the way I look because my body and the way I physically look has always been something, if not the main thing, ive been praised for. But I want to be more than that. It honestly sometimes feels like I bring nothing else to the table and it’s so difficult to not be vain or to not sin sexually because teenage boys and people always try to put me in the position to. I say no and everything but it’s honestly so difficult when kids my age are always saying stuff like “you could get anyone you want or hook up with anyone” when that’s NOT. WHAT. I WANT. This sounds like such a stupid and bratty thing to say but honestly I feel like it’s something I struggle with because I just feel like it’s the only thing I can provide because I’m not super smart or anything and don’t have a fantastic personality. I don’t know if it’s a valid struggle to offer up as a cross or sacrifice to be humble or not care about my appearance. Idk I hope this didn’t come off as prideful or anything because if anything I’m one of the most insecure people ever. Thank you guys. So much. 

Edit: I know people on here may look down upon me for even asking advice on this or spit in my face for “complaining” or asking about being pretty or whatever you wanna call it and why it’s a bad thing and I know how many people wish they were in the position that I’m in, but I promise it’s so much worse than it seems and there’s very few upsides, ESPECIALLY as a Catholic striving for holiness.

Does anyone have a good response to an argument against the fourth cup?,Physical_Fruit_8814,1623379631,"(1) Jesus is the head of the table in Matthew 26:26-29. He is the one serving the disciples. However, in Luke 23:36, it is clear that a Roman soldier was serving the sour wine (oxos). Therefore, if Hahn is to be believed, at the Cross, an unrepentant Roman soldier, whom God held morally responsible for the murder of his very Son (Acts 2:22-23; 4:27-28), was the Head of the Table? Do reprobates serve the Eucharist in the Catholic Church? Since we are dealing with typology here: (a) is Jesus, like the Roman soldier, a sinner? (but see 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Pet 2:22) or (b) is the Roman soldier not a sinner and therefore did not need to repent (see Rom 3:23)? I feel confident that Dr. Hahn knows better than this, but it is the logical consequence of his typology argument.

(2) Jesus was offered wine twice upon the Cross: (a) wine + gall (myrrh) to ease his suffering, which he refused (Mark 15:23; cf. Matt 27:34 (esmyrnismenon oinon) and (b) sour wine (oxos) which was to prolong suffering, which Jesus partook (Matt 27:48; Mark 15:36; Luke 23:36; John 19:30). However, neither of those wine mixtures was the ""fruit of the vine"" (genematos tes ampelou) Jesus was referring to in Matthew 26:29. So, neither the Roman medicating or prolonging wines fulfill the passage in question.

(3) Matthew 26:27 mentions ""a cup,"" while Matthew 27:48 and Mark 15:36 speak of a sponge put on a reed. John 19:29 mentions ""a hyssop stalk,"" (cf. Exod 12:22). But a ""cup"" (poterion) is not the same as a ""sponge"" (spongon), or a ""reed"" (kalamo), or a ""hyssop stock"" (hyssopo). Therefore, we observe a different delivery method for the different wines.

(4) The cup that Jesus spoke of in Matthew 26:29 could not have happened upon Calvary because all the saints (""with you"") were not drinking too. The majority of the disciples were hiding and Peter wasn't even restored until after Jesus' resurrection in John 21:15-25. After denying Christ three times (Matt 26:34, 69-75; Mark 14:30, 66-72; Luke 22:34, 54-62; John 18:15-27), was Peter even qualified at the moment of the crucifixion to participate in the Lord's Table? See 1 Corinthians 11:28.

(5) Since serving both a medicating wine mixed with gall (esmyrnismenon oinon) and prolonging sour wine (oxos) were a normal part of the Roman crucifixion process, two other people that day of days were partaking of wine while being crucified - the two thieves crucified with Jesus. One was repentant and the other was not (Luke 23:39-43). If this was the fourth cup why wasn't it guarded against the unrepentant one partaking of the sour wine? (1 Cor 11:28). Jesus guarded the cup, not allowing Judas to drink the fourth cup, and Judas left during the meal before the Cup's introduction (John 13:18-30; cf. Matt 26:20-27; Mark 14:18-23).

(6) ""It is finished"" is from the Greek word ""tetelestai,"" which means to complete or to fulfill. It is in the perfect tense - which is made up of: (a) the aorist and (b) the present tenses. The aorist tense means that something happens at a specific point in time. The Present tense means something that continues on into the future and has ongoing results. In other words, when Jesus spoke those words he was speaking of both an ""accomplished fact"" and an ""ongoing fact""; it is finished and it will go on being finished. From God's perspective nothing else present or future needed to be done. Therefore, ""It is finished"" (John 19:30) can't refer to the table which is continually repeated until Jesus returns (1 Cor 11:26).",Catholicism

I still think this, while also understanding He is a God of judgement too. But lately I’ve been reading things on different reddit pages (Christian ones) basically saying how God is wrathful, jealous, and doesn’t actually love us all equally—more or less painting God out to be like He low-key in reality doesn’t like us but will throw us a bone every once in a while if He feels like it.

My friends and I have started a discord server for ecumenical dialogue surrounding Christianity and what it means to be Christian in a western world that is increasingly losing its character as “Christendom”.

We have resource channels with information about Saints, how to pray the rosary, images of beautiful churches from around the world, memes, and much more! Anyone of any faith is welcome to join, but the server’s topic is Christianity. The mod team is made up of Catholics (such as myself) and Eastern Orthodox, but we are encouraging Protestants and Christians who aren’t sure what theology is true to join as well. 

Basically, if you’re interested in dialoging with other Christians (and sharing the beauty of our Catholic faith) you’re more than welcome to join. And for those non-Catholic lurkers here, you’re welcome to join as well!

As a start, my alcoholic mother bailed on us when I was a few months old and I was raised by my father alone. And except my aunt I never had any women around while growing up, but even she lived in an other town and only saw her a few times a year. My mother never tried to reach out to me and I also had/have 0 desire to meet her. As far as I know she lives in an other country right now with another man.

On the other hand, ever since I was in kindergarten I always wanted to be a boy. I imagined myself as some warrior or adventurer and never really had any female friends until the last 5 years that was more than ""well, at least I'm not sitting alone"" despite me being one of the most popular girls. 

I have no idea if this is related to my mother leaving us, but I never hated her that could lead me to despise women, to me that reasoning just feels like blaming others for my own doings.

Despite wanting to be a boy I liked being girl, I always dreamed of becoming a mother, never wanted to chop off my boobs or any of that tranny stuff. Even back then I liked my body, I'm not like those lesbians with manjaw and wide shoulders, others usually rate me 8. I just felt like if I could choose, I'd be rather born as a boy.  


&gt;!I discovered masturbation sooner, but after seeing porn in 6th grade I started watching and doing it multiple times almost every single day and fantasizing that I'm having sex with other boys while being a boy myself. Soon I started doing more deranged stuff like putting things in my butt because ""if I was a boy that's how I would have sex with other boys"".
!&lt;

&gt;!When I was 16 I read somewhere that sex on weed feels really good, so I bought some for the first time and tried masturbating while I was high. It was the best thing I ever felt then, and since my father worked the night shift every other day, after he left I spent that time hitting a bong with something up in my butt while masturbating and watching porn for hours.
!&lt;

Sometimes after finishing I was disgusted by myself and even wanted to throw up, but the longest time I could stop was 3 or 4 weeks. I could only stop for longer times when I had a boyfriend, because it felt bad to look into his eyes while doing this and we also had normal sex, so I was satisfied. The first one was when I was 15 and other than him I had 3 other including the current one, but I've not slept with him and have no intention until we are married. We are together for 1,5 years now.

I'm 24 and and this went on until I was 19. That's when I could stop for good but ever since then once or twice every year I have nightmares that I'm doing these deranged things.

Back then I wasn't a practicing catholic, I was baptized and everything and thought that there is some God, but yeah, that was the end of it, nothing deeper.

I never talked to anybody about this and no one ever found out. How do I even confess this? Should I just say that I had trans/homosexual tendencies while doing sexually degenerate things to myself? I doubt a priest wants to listen to all this disgusting stuff.",Catholicism

Long Confession?,jaydeke,1623346053,"How long is too long for the penitent line?

I recently gave my first confession (39y) and we spent an hour together by appointment (the actual confession was around 30m). The priest suggested it was good practice to come back every month to confess venial sins (or sooner if there were mortal sins), which I intend to do. 

It’s a month later now and I’ve started remembering more serious things from 10+ years ago that were accidentally left out of the first confession. I’ve read these should still be confessed if I remember them. It would probably take about 5-10 minutes to cover this month’s venial sins and another 10 to address the other things. Should I set an appointment? I don’t want to be a burden on the priest by asking for a second appointment - he seems like a busy guy - but I don’t want to keep anyone from receiving confession either if it runs long.

Other suggestions?

"Difference between Catholic and Orthodox ways of ""working"" with religion",TickTack3,1623345277,"I posted this on other subreddit, but I didn't get the answer, so I will ask here.

I talked to nun, who said, that she thinks Eastern Orthodox Church took the right direction by mainly focusing on prayer and spirituality and Catholic Church took wrong direction by focusing more on  philosophy and researching religion like Thomas Aquinas. She also thinks, that this direction is the reason, why we have more problems with atheists than them (that part kind of made me confussed to be honest, because I think that we absolutely HAVE to use scientific knowledge to argue with atheists).

NBA playoffs,AcrobaticSource3,1623345010,"I like watching basketball as much a the next girl, especially now during playoff time. But what I have seen a lot more in recent years is a player thanking God for the victory. This rubs me the wrong way, like they think that God had a role in the game and, worse, that God has chosen to assist their team over the other team. I find it hard to believe that God takes sides (except maybe against the New Jersey Devils, lol), so these thanks to God seek a bit empty to me, and maybe a little superficial. Also, a lot of these players will thank God for the victory, then do some very un-God-loving things in the clubs after the game.

Looking for a Non-Cheesy Introduction to Scripture,Lekkusu,1623343014,"*Coming from a perspective of someone who was an atheist all of his life until a few years ago*

I feel viscerally repulsed when scriptures are taught in a smiley, cheesy, naive way. 

For example: most Bible studies I find cringy, they make it sound like Jesus just wants to hug you and say everything is alright. 

Or the Bible in a year podcast with Fr. Mike Schmitz. It’s a shame because this man is clearly very knowledgeable, but I can’t help but roll my eyes when he forces laughter and says “Gosh” before starting any interpretation.

The Chosen One series is very helpful, but still strikes me as less frank than the Bible can often be.

I think in general these attempts to appear harmless and nice—like an overly-friendly salesman—are insincere and actually ineffective at spreading the word of God. When I was an atheist, the people who’d talk about God in this happy-go-lucky way were NEVER compelling and always made me double down in my beliefs.

The Bible is as heavy a book as has ever been written, and I’m trying to learn from the wisdom of those who have studied it all of their lives without being taught by some giggly cornball.

I don’t think God is the sun from Teletubies that just floats there and smiles spreading joy and pleasure. I think God is TRULY loving and gives love in many more ways than mere affection and sympathy. 

I would appreciate a resource that introduces Jesus and God in all of his righteousness in a readily understandable way, without sweeping away the things that make us modern people uncomfortable.

THE TRIAL,Affectionate-Feed759,1623340243,"&amp;#x200B;

I was fooling around with a buddy, we both were still very young, about 10 years old. Our adventures were on our bikes, the street in front of our house was under construction constituting a wonderful play ground for two bikers with high ambitions. We built ramps to jump as far as possible with our bikes, sometimes falling on the dirt and scratching our arms and faces. The next jump would be better. In the days this street was built a national day came and in the market we had the biggest selection of explosives. We bought quite a bunch since detonating them under rocks and such was fun, and sometimes hurtful as one blew close to my ear leaving me deaf for three days. Recovery was complete happily. Those were the days in which an adventure began with a bell ringing and a shout “HEEEEYYYYY, bring the bike!”. I was temerary enough to climb with a rope from the fassade of his house when we had no keys to go to buy something or go home. It was fun. Pablo was a really good friend in those days, one I hope has made a wonderful life blessed by our Lord.

In those days, my life was not absent of violence, I was beaten often for things I never did. Seemed that being the youngest means to be hated or a real pain in the ass of the older siblings who were many years older than me. Yes I was the accident, not planned.

One day, as Pablo my buddy and me were in my room at home, I was standing in front of him. Behind me was a bookseller, very old made of massive wood that belonged to my granddad from father's side. I was talking to Pablo thinking about the next ramps we could build but asking where to get the shovels needed to make it BIG, when in a split second I fainted. In a split second I was in a kind of movie theater, it was dark but not scary. The feeling of peace was incredible. I had no fears, no needs, no longings anymore, none of the physical needs we feel in our bodies. In like a kind of movie I started staring at each and every moment of my life as a third person, I knew it was my life since there were events I could never recall again but that passed since in that moment they all were recognized as my life and the level of detail was remarkable, indeed nothing you can imagine, and all true. While this was happening I was not alone. An omnipresent entity was with me, that did not scare me the least, it was like giving me support and was also watching all. I heard all, I saw all, I revived all, but seen from a view free of any earthly judgments since it was lacking interest in justifying anything. The only interest was to see if what I did due to the previous events was right or not. This confused me, the lack of need of justifying indicated the purest state of conscience free of any earthly interest and vanity or pride. It was seen with the most clear conscience free of any contamination and I was there to see how I did things, what I did, why I did, and how I felt doing it. I felt all the sorrows and joys I had when I fought, when I made a gift even to the ones who hit me, all. The level of scrutiny was profound, to the littlest detail, yet not guided by selfish interests but the clearest understanding of good and bad. The level of discernment was high, very high. I was in this state when the end was approaching and a feeling of “I did well” overwhelmed me. Scrutinized was all, interactions with others, feelings in the moment these interactions were happening, my balance was if not excellent, was also not disappointing. As I was expecting a second opinion on this and in the knowledge already I did not want to leave this state of beauty in which I found myself, beauty not physical, spiritual, a soft male voice, loving but firm, very very firm said “Not now, go back”. And in that moment I woke up to find when I opened my eyes my buddy staring at me in fear and panic. I asked what happened. He told me I was like dead and pale as never before for about 5 to 10 minutes. He asked me what happened to me, I just said: “No idea, I feel now fine but why am I on the floor?”

“You were talking and suddenly, out of nothing you fell and hit your head many times, bouncing on the shelves and the bed (which had also a strong piece of wood at the lowest part, there where the feet go). You fell like dead, what is wrong with you?”

“Nothing now, I have no idea what happened, I was in a strange quiet place with movies”. I said, not wanting to give further explanation as I have to admit I was at that time kinda sad I could not stay there. The feeling of peace was so incredible and the lack of needs was so extremely comforting. I hated to have returned.

Years passed and life continued normally. This event was sometimes remembered by me and I asked myself why all that? Never got to a good conclusion as I was small. This was through the years a memory that something was after we go; this was clear. Also, that it was God who sent me back and maybe this was for many years just something like an event that I gave not much importance, but since that day, fear of death was absent in me. This I believe made me take higher risks in my life, regarding my safety. I have to admit that as the years passed I realized nothing will take me to Him unless He wants me there or calls me. In the meantime I have something to do here, but a stubborn mind that not easily accepts impositions can be tough to be lead. I have to admit this.

The events of fainting happen not often but sometimes to me, have checked all and seems I have trouble with keeping a good heartbeat under heavy stress, and sometimes I just disconnect. In none of this faintings I have been again there nor conscious about what is happening.

Sisters, Brothers, there is something else after this earthly life. It is important you can make peace with the ones you love, and with yourselves. One thing is clear now as years passed and the understanding is clearer: you can not arrive to this trial with anger or hate. Forgiveness for me has a different meaning now, it is focused on what I want to see in this movie the next time I see it, as I am sure I will see it again. The biggest sorrow you can have here, is not related to things unfinished like work, no... God is the one that calls us, so He would never judge on this, but unfinished cleansing of rancors. This is the biggest challenge we have. Learn to forgive, learn to love with respect and without measure, learn to be selfless as this selflessness mixed with love and mercy for all human beings, are the most incredible, magnificent, powerful sensations when you sit with Him watching the movie and they are the key that open the door to our home.

Another good lesson I learned, but this with the years is that God exists and all He has told us IS TRUE. Have certainty in Him, endless certainty, when He is close, all is different, you don't want to leave! And the love He has for us is something that not even in the trial, we can completely understand and see due to its greatness in purity and intensity.

I write this as a testimony, nothing here is invented, nothing wants to search for recognition from anybody, this happened. I am NOT a great person, I am NOT perfect, I am sinner, immensely loved by Abba, Yeshua and Mom. Sorry but I can not leave the woman I love most out of this. I owe them so so so much that every time I mention my sweet Mother I cry of happiness because our Saviour and King has her, they all build the foundation of the Kingdom to come with the Holy Spirit. This my dearest sisters and brothers, is my faith? LOL, no, not any more, it is my certainty.

Our loving God bless you, I hope I was able to transmit a bit how much we are loved by Him, and also, how much we can hurt them with bad attitudes and sins. ",Catholicism

St Peters in Rome is a remarkable Basilica. The Biggest Church in the world and has influence thousands of others in their construction. Built over the tomb of a man who was crucified upside down because of his courage and humility and who experienced forgiveness from Jesus for denying him,TJB74,1623339396,"&amp;#x200B;

*  St Peters holds a unique position in the Christian world. This was acknowledged in a sinister way when the Islamic terror group ISIS, featured St. Peter’s Square on its cover of their propaganda magazine with the headline “The Failed Crusade,” It depicted the terrorist group’s infamous blag flag flying over the piazza’s central obelisk. 
*  built over the burial site of Saint Peter, the first Bishop of Rome.  According to the early Christian scholar Origen, Peter was crucified upside down, by his own request because he considered himself unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus. The crucifixion took place near an ancient Egyptian obelisk in the Circus of Nero.  The obelisk, one of four in Rome,  now stands in St. Peter's Square and is revered as a ""witness"" to Peter's death. 
* The area now covered by the Vatican City had been a cemetery for some years before the Circus of Nero was built. It became a burial ground for the numerous executions in the Circus and contained many Christian burials. Peter's remains were buried just outside the Circus, on the Vatican Hill across the Via Cornelia from the Circus, less than 150 metres from his place of death.  The tradition of the early church was that bereaved Christians buried martyrs as near as possible to the scene of their suffering. It is believed that the burial of Peter followed this custom. A shrine was built on this site some years later. 
*  The actual tomb was an underground vault, approached from the road by a descending staircase, and the body reposed in a sarcophagus of stone in the centre of this vault.  During the reign of Valerian, Christian persecution was particularly severe and the remains of the Christian dead had lost their usual protections under Roman law. The remains of Peter and Paul may have been removed secretly by night in order to preserve them from desecration by the Romans. They were returned to their original tombs in 260 when Valerian's reign ended.

Science Disproves God's Existence?,ZealousidealCreme770,1623329860,"Hello!

Every once in a while I will go on Atheist YouTube (which I can only do so much in a day) and I keep hearing really 2 types of arguments. 

1) The Problem of Pain/Suffering.

2) Science disproves God's existence. 

I feel as Christians we can be trapped in defending a man in the sky argument of God, that is no difference than a Zeus. Like the famous line that we are all atheist , its just atheist go one god further. However, I know the Gospels and Aquinas say that God is being itself. 

Secondly, I feel that if we could analyze God, he wouldn't be God...since he transcends space, time and matter. Also, many leading scientist in the past were devout Christians. 

I know there are many amazing Catholic Scientist today like Karin Öberg from Harvard and such...but I feel that this argument isn't that convincing to me.

Catholic Encyclopedia on the Shroud of Turin,Low-Elk-8809,1623328288,"Generally I think of this sub as relatively rational and level-headed, so one thing that surprises me is the way posts critical of the Shroud are always downvoted into oblivion. I found it interesting then when I came across the [1912 Catholic Encyclopedia article](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13762a.htm) on the Shroud (Nihil Obstat + Imprimatur'd!) that it takes a dim view of its authenticity, and argues against it:

\&gt; Plausible as this contention appeared, a most serious historical difficulty had meanwhile been brought to light. Owing mainly to the researches of Canon Ulysse Chevalier a series of documents was discovered which clearly proved that in 1389 the Bishop of Troyes appealed to Clement VII, the Avignon Pope then recognized in France, to put a stop to the scandals connected to the Shroud preserved at Lirey. It was, the Bishop declared, the work of an artist who some years before had confessed to having painted it but it was then being exhibited by the Canons of Lirey in such a way that the populace believed that it was the authentic shroud of Jesus Christ. The pope, without absolutely prohibiting the exhibition of the Shroud, decided after full examination that in the future when it was shown to the people, the priest should declare in a loud voice that it was not the real shroud of Christ, but only a picture made to represent it. The authenticity of the documents connected with this appeal is not disputed. Moreover, the grave suspicion thus thrown upon the relic is immensely strengthened by the fact that no intelligible account, beyond wild conjecture, can be given of the previous history of the Shroud or its coming to Lirey. 

\&gt; Lastly, the difficulty must be noticed that while the witnesses of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries speak of the image as being then so vivid that the blood seemed freshly shed, it is now darkened and hardly recognizable without minute attention. On the supposition that this is an authentic relic dating from the year A.D. 30, why should it have retained its brilliance through countless journeys and changes of climate for fifteen centuries, and then in four centuries more have become almost invisible? On the other hand if it be a fabrication of the fifteenth century this is exactly what we should expect.

\&gt; Baumgarten in Historiches Jahrbuch (Munich, 1903), 319-43, shows that the preponderance of Catholic opinion is greatly against the authenticity of the shroud. 

(Full disclosure: I am a lapsed Catholic and agnostic, but I'm not posting this to debunk™ the Church. The Shroud of Turin is not an article of faith. The only thing I will say is that it kinda reflects a Church culture of being a little too eager to believe in relics/private revelation, but there are plenty of sceptical Catholics too).",Catholicism

Repent now!,Monk-That,1623322724,"TL;DR  I've had a terrible vision.  Repent, confess, and atone for your sins.

Long version:

Brethren, I've hesitated writing this for five days now, but I think I can keep it to myself no longer.  Here is my story:  I was baptised into the Church a few years ago after a life of sin.  I had fallen into masturbating to pornography.  A few months before my baptism, I decided it was time I gave that up.  It was then I discovered that it was not so easily done, and I struggled terribly with it.  

There was a period of three years where confessions were no longer heard in my parish.  I used to travel to another parish for confession.  Having gone through the now only too familiar routine of sin-confession-sin, I found myself confessing my sin again for the umpteenth time.  When I had finished,  there was a moment of silence before these words came from behind the screen; not angrily, not harshly, but rather in a matter-of-fact tone of voice: *You are going to Hell.*  And yet not even a priest *in persona Christi* was enough, and the pattern of sin-confession-sin continued.

Then the lockdown came, and I was forced to work from home.  I fell deeper into my sin.  What was once now and again became every day.  And every day eventually turned into as many times a day as I could find opportunity.  Well, I told myself, you're retiring at the end of June.  You won't have to sit at home in front of a computer all day.  You can make an effort to put things right with God then.

Five nights ago, I had a dream.  I can't say that it was a real vision of what awaited me, or whether it was a guilty conscience, or my subconscious mind running amok; but I was there in bed, and felt a malevolent presence, then a fear that words cannot describe gripped me.   A demon came through my window to take me.  I tried screaming, but no sound came out.  The demon smiled, and mocked me as I continued to scream in silence.

It was at that point I awoke to find myself sitting up in bed with my wife holding me, and me screaming at the top of my lungs.  Even now as I type this I find myself shaking.  I am 58 years old, and have had nightmares before, but never have I screamed in my sleep, never was I still shaking days later.  I was so terrified by this vision that the temptation to sin left me immediately.

The next day I did a web search for *prayers to atone for sin.*  The first link was to the Seven Sorrows of Mary. I've been praying this every day in addition to the Rosary.  And on Saturday, I have an appointment for confession.  

Repent.  Confess.  Atone for your sins.  Do it now, not when you think it might be more convenient for you.  Save yourselves.  Repent.  Confess.  Atone.  Now.",Catholicism

I try to get comfortable when saying these long evening prayers which is never a good thing, sometimes I drift off to sleep saying them. Well I think the devil just delights in this, that evening though he blew it.


It annoyed me that much I thought about how I could annoy him more? We have hard concrete paving stones out the back so decided to say the rest of my prayers kneeling on these. Instant clarity of mind, the pain of kneeling soon ebbed away and I was able to finish my prayers in peace also with a slight delight in knowing how much it irritated him.


Too much comfort is never a good thing, the mind wanders, perhaps I should pray more kneeling like this. God bless",Catholicism

Best Protestant to Catholic Conversion Story on Youtube?,britskye23x,1623305806,"Hi everybody! My family &amp; I converted from Baptists to Catholics when I was a teenager.

That in Flesh the bread may change,

And the wine in Christ's own Blood.

Faith, the law of light transcending

Leaps to things not understood.

Here beneath these signs are hidden

Priceless things, to sense forbidden;

Signs, not things, are all we see.

Flesh from bread, and Blood from wine,

Yet is Christ in either sign,

All entire confessed to be.

And whoev'r of Him partakes,

Severs not, nor rends, nor breaks:

All entire, their Lord receive.

Whether one or thousand eat,

All receive the self-same meat,

Nor do less for others leave.

Both the wicked and the good

Eat of this celestial Food:

But with ends how opposite!

With this most substantial Bread,

Unto life or death they're fed,

In a difference infinite.

Nor a single doubt retain,

When they break the Host in twain,

But that in each part remain

What was in the whole before;

For the outward sign alone

May some change have undergone,

While the Signified stays one,

And the same forevermore.

For us pilgrims food, and token

Of the promise by Christ spoken,

Children's meat, to dogs denied!

In the Manna's preparation,

In the Paschal immolation,

In old types pre-signified.

Pity all who pardon seek,

And who place all trust in Thee,

Why Have I Felt Like This For So Long?,ClassicGalactic,1623283012,"So about 3 years ago, I read a Creepypasta that was based off of a real board game called ""Rap Rat."" It basically said that if you said ""Aparat"" out loud, then you would be cursed by a Haitian Voodoo Fear Demon for the rest of your life.

I was being a foolish 12 year old, and I blurted it out compulsively.

I then became absolutely horrified, and a small muscle knot formed in my back. It's still there today and I've only managed to release it by meditating once like for a second.

Over the past 3 years, I've suffered from intrusive thoughts, problems focusing, and Anxiety from time to time. Like thoughts of me doing horrific violent acts.

These felt like urges, but I learned that intrusive thoughts can feel like urges because it tricks a part of the brain into thinking it needs to ""take action.""

However, I've done more research on it, and I found out that there is no Entity or Demon in any religion named ""Aparat.""

Also, I said the word so many times trying to convince my subconscious mind that nothing would happen and that it wasn't real. It said that 3:30-4:00 AM would be when it would most likely try to scare you. I've stayed up to that time so many times, yet nothing has ever happened. I never heard Scratched or had demonic nightmares, or anything like that. Haven't really seen any random unexplainable scratches on me at all, and Aparat actually means device in many different languages. I've even mocked the name to try and show my own overthinking mind that nothing will happen. I have Autism and ADD, so I can become obsessed with crap like this.

Also, many YouTubers have said the word out-loud when narrating their videos. They are all still fine, even years later.

The writer of the story even posted an Ask me anything 3 years after he made it, so he's still fine. I've never done a ritual, evocation, or any stuff like that in my lifetime. So why have I felt anxiety for so long? Am I just crazy?

However, recently I've noticed the feelings of a strange sensation, like someone's touching my arms. I've been feeling random little pains every now and then. However, It's felt that way in Mass, so, it might not even be demonic. But I've noticed small little red marks on my arms that eventually disappear every now and then. I even saw that my Dad had a couple of scratches on his side that he didn't know the origin of, and it might have just been the Dog, or him getting into a Truck, but I'm still really scared that I've attracted something evil that will hurt my family too.

When is it wrong to end a donation?,emptyyellowbowl,1623270002,"Backstory:  I was a radical feminist for way too long, and I found out it was a giant disgusting lie largely by going to the absolute bitter end of where feminist analysis can lead you, and realizing that feminism is extremely incorrect and wrong. There was one woman in particular who wrote forcefully on the topic and I credit her with helping me follow the logical path of feminism, which eventually led to me to Christ. I do not have a relationship with her at all, I don't comment on her posts, etc.

That woman, however, while no longer a feminist per se, she's tragically nihilistic, hates men/patriarchy, and still maintains a liberation/oppression mindset. And she's chronically/terminally ill, financially destitute, and survives mostly on donations. I've donated to her monthly for a couple years and still skim through her blog posts even though they're still largely ... just depressing. I generally don't like giving to nonprofit organizations because I worked for nonprofit organizations and I'm largely unimpressed; makes more sense to directly give money to a person who needs money.

Recently, she posted about how mothers are whores and mothers of sons are the worst and mothers have nothing of value to say anymore because most women have been mothers and look at the state of things with them in charge and blah blah blah woe is me the world is awful.

My husband and I have a son, and I stay home to raise him. I think I don't want to use the money my husband earns for our family to support this woman anymore. However, we're not hurting for money, she's still a person in legitimate need of money, and whatever her beliefs are, she still needs people to show her love via financial support. 

I've had these ideas:

(1) Continue donating
(a) Message her and tell her that I considered ending my donation but I decided not to because Jesus loves her. 
(b) Mind my own business and don't make my desire to end the donation her problem. 

(2) End the donation
(a) Message her and tell her why.
(b) Don't tell her why, she'll figure it out given that she said she's lost about 3 donors already.

(3) Make a large one time donation and end the monthly donation
(a) Message her and tell her why
(b) Don't tell her why.

I disregarded Jesus for my addiction.,jackjyoung,1623269663,"I am not a confirmed Catholic, and I am not even in RCIA, but I plan to start soon. 

I've struggled with porn and masturbation addiction for almost a decade. Eventually, once I found myself in a relationship with a woman that I adore, this slowly crept its way into becoming a big problem. I've made attempts to stop, and I've been more successful than I ever was when I just did it for myself, but I've still not ever been successful. 

The other day, I asked her if I could just do it one final time so that I could have a ""send off"" and finally make the delineation in my brain that I was fully done, and even though this addiction has been causing massive, apocalyptic problems for us as of late, (mainly because I kept telling her that I was done and then succumbed to my addiction again) she eventually gave me the go ahead even though she hated it because she just wants this to be over, and I promised it would be the final time. 

Surprise. I messed up again the day after that and that led to the near dissolution of our relationship last night. 

I was still thinking that I wanted that same chance from before again so I could create that delineation of fully being finished, but once I actually thought about it, I realized I didn't want to. I had a pretty large religious experience too, even seeing Jesus and wanting to make him proud as a good, Christian man. 

But then she mentioned out of seemingly nowhere about how she didn't want me to do that, as I had brought it up the night before. 

And instantly. As soon as it was mentioned. Every single positive thought I was having vanished. I didn't even try to ignore them. They were literally just instantly gone. And then I started to convince her why it was okay, and I convinced myself too. She eventually said okay, and afterwards, I remembered. And now I am crushed.

Mental prayer,Mental-Pineapple-504,1623249047,"Im trying to start making that a daily routine, and it's pretty difficult to understand. Im not sure if I did it right. I'm looking for some tips or suggestions. I listened to Fr Ripperger talk about it.

The first time I tried, I decided to try to meditate on the ""Sprit of truth"" portion of this prayer in my rite (it starts like ""heavenly king comfortor, spirit of truth, who art everywhere and fillest all things, treasury of blessings, and giver of life..."")

I feel like I had some sort of moment where I understood God a little better. This was more or less my thought process when I was going through it: (its long)

truth is light, it just is, the evil is darkness and lies (sin is accepting to live a lie, in the way contrary to how God intended because God is truth, and the only way to live in the light is to live the truth and not run from it, judgement made sense, purgatory made sense because its like cleansing of the lies we've lived that sin has caused us to (because even original sin was about accepting the lie as truth, staining us), we are in the image of God which is the spirit of truth so God's intention was to live in truth with no lies, that part of the Bible in exodus when God said if He showed His face to the Israelites they would die made more sense (because we hide behind lies we dont even realize sometimes and accepting the truth fully as it is is seriously painful and it would be too much at once for us to handle because of sin), and the part of the Bible where God revealed His name (meaning ""I am"") made sense, because the truth just is. If I called a dog a cat, a dog is still a dog regardless, it doesnt change the truth to what it is and calling it by another name is just a lie, so God just is and present in all because God is truth. The truth always comes out, and its our choice to live in the truth in this life or not, but if we dont, it will still come to light on our day of judgement because you cannot change truth (also God doesnt change, neither does the truth).

I went on like that for awhile, then basically made the decision to try to live in truth more and more every day and turning away from the lies I hold close. Then I thought about my trauma and how they distort my perception of the truth, causing me to live a lie. Trauma is essentially lies I tell myself about myself every day. And I made a resolution to start learning about and resolving the trauma that makes me live a lie and not function to my fullest, the way I was intended to. I've been asking God to help me see the events that started my trauma so I can start separating truth from lies and live more fully in the truth. And I thanked God for waking me up (i just came back a few months ago) and said I wanted to get to know Him better.

I'm kind of worried about possible heresy as I'm trying to do this, as well as being unsure I'm on the right track.

Catholic teachings on combat sports.,MaRs1317,1623244925,"Over the pandemic, I began training in Muay Thai, which is a form of Taiwanese martial art similar to Kick Boxing. I'm a bit overweight and I was getting a little depressive, so a friend reccomended took me to his gym because he though it would help me out. Long story short...It helped alot. 

However, my curiosity will always get the best of me, so I had to look into what the catholic church teaches about violent aspects of combat sports. What I found was that most would say that it is sinful to partake in such things. This is causing some issues for me. The practice of martial arts has done really great things for me over the past few months. It has i.proved my relationships to my family and friends, it has improves my relationship with myself, it gives me goals that I can work to achieve and build up my self confidence. 

The truth of it is that when I'm practicing martial arts, I feel closer to God than when I don't. I feel like the improvements it helps me make in my life are in accordance with God's plan. Now that I have some fight training, I believe I've become more discipline and more likely to live a life of peace and stewardship. I don't know if that makes sense, what I'm trying to say that the fact that I know that I. Able to fight and defend myself and my family makes me more peaceful and less likely to engage in violence. 

Long story short: I feel like practicing martial arts has made me a better man, and isn't that what God wants for me?

Genuine question about the TLM from an Orthodox Christian,FVWHAlpha,1623241435,"So I've been pacing around trying to think of the best way to phrase this, because it's a tricky question. I recently have visited 3 Catholic Masses of the Extraordinary Form, one Low Mass and two High Masses. Now I wish to preface this saying I found the services to be beautiful and incredibly reverent towards God. However my question behind everything, behind the beauty, the aesthetics, the reverence, the 'bells and whistles' as it were was: why Latin? I fully understand its the language of the Catholic Church and that its one of the languages found traditionally in the New Testament. However I found it rather strange because I felt I had to use a Roman Missal, yet to me using a Missal kind of defeats the purpose of attending church, you're meaning to be taking in the senses being invoked, incense for smell, singing for hearing etc

So my question I guess is multi-faceted: Do you like the Extraordinary Form? If so, why? Is it specifically Latin? Or is it just the age of the Mass and beauty of it compared with the Novus Ordo?

Trusting your conscience vs. rationalization,pleaseplease8899,1623240724,"About six months ago, I bought Christmas presents for friends. One had noted his interest in a comic series, so I bought him a glossy comic book of that character. Upon getting it, I noticed how scantily clad the character was dressed. I contacted my priest who framed it as a question of “I know it when I see it,” pornography, and not giving it to him if I think he’d get aroused or I think it was intended to cause arousal. 

I initially agreed to err on the side of caution. I returned the item of Amazon, but then it informed me I didn’t even have to send the item back to get my money back. So I got the refund, but the item was still lying around. Then that friend came over, and in the spur of the moment, I gave him the comic book. 

When I thought about this, I didn’t think it could be sinful, or if so it had to be venial, because of all the films and shows and such I watch with friends that have scantily clad women in them. I thought it couldn’t be sinful every single time I show a piece of media with something risqué to a friend. So I put it out of my mind. 

Since then, I’ve gotten more serious about my faith and have been regularly going to confession. My question is, did I commit a mortal sin since I did initially have reservations and got advice from a priest basically suggesting I err on the side of caution? And were all my intervening confessions invalid since I didn’t mention this? Because for a time I think I did convince myself it couldn’t be wrong.

Having trouble with morality on internet piracy and adblockers.,nekikatolik,1623237164,"Hi all, so I'll get straight to the point:

I've been looking around about the morality of internet piracy and adblockers. It seems that the majority of people here view internet piracy as immoral, which I agree with based on my own intuition.

However, when the question of adblockers comes up, it seems most do not view them as immoral and are in favour of them. This confuses me, let me explain why:

How is using an adblocker while listening to music on YouTube any different than just pirating it? Because, the music on YouTube is NOT free, you pay for it through the ad revenue you generate by watching the ads. When you use an adblocker, you aren't paying for it through the ad revenue as you've blocked the ads, therefore the artist and record label don't receive their rightful dues from you for their work. How is that any different from piracy? (The same goes for any content on YouTube or other platforms, I just chose the music example.)

It seems to me that if one were to claim adblockers are moral, he'd also have to claim piracy as moral. And vice versa, it seems to me that if someone claims piracy is immoral, he'd have to claim adblockers are immoral too.

This has been bugging my scrupulous mind a lot, and I've since disabled my adblocker on YouTube as I can't use it in good conscience. I've looked for counter-arguments for the one I made, but sadly it doesn't seem like that many people have talked about this before, so please share your thoughts.

Thank you and God bless.",Catholicism

Dealing with anti-Catholicism or Catholic-phobia in modern days,gabrielms123,1623230346,"I wonder if you guys are going through the same things I'm feeling and how you handle it.

As I get more and more sure of my love for God and my will to go to heaven, I try to get deeper into my faith and the Church's teaching. 

I have the impression that when we dive into the Catechism and Catholic philosophy, everything makes sense, and I genuinely believe our Church has our souls' best interests in mind. 

Even if I already agreed with most of what our Church says, I started to understand better and defend our positions on polemic topics such as abortion, euthanasia, insemination, female priesthood, etc. 

However, when living in a very anti-Catholic country in Scandinavia, I developed this intricate fear of voicing my opinions in fear of repression. Anti-Catholic propaganda is all over the place and very often in a very aggressive way towards our beliefs. It's like a society that asks for tolerance doesn't tolerate Catholics having an opinion. 

This created a weird feeling in me. For example, I will only say I'm against abortion when I am with people I know are tolerant, and even so, I'll try to say it discretely, fearing some random stranger will try to fight me.

Am I paranoid, or do you guys feel the same in the countries you live in? How do you handle it?

Doctrine of Suicide and Feelings of Not Being Enough,ZTeam534,1623215948,"I disagree about the church's views on suicide. Now I am creating this post because I'm hoping to gain some insight and not come across as ignorant. When it comes to suicide, I understand that it is a sin because you are choosing to end your life prematurely before God calls you.  But I don't believe people commit suicide to go against God. With that being said (because I have been there before) I never wanted to commit suicide because I wanted to hurt God, family, and friends. I've never really WANTED to do it, but at times it felt like it was the only option left. I didn't want to die, either. Sometimes I feel I want to die, but I don't actually want to die because I want to live and serve God. The only reason I am living today is because I am fearful of God's judgement of my life and because the dying process scares me. So maybe it's a blessing in disguise. 

So, if I have severe depression or any other mental illness(es), and I kill myself, then I believe God would have mercy upon my soul and take into account my mental illness(es) and struggles on earth. It's not a want to die, it's not a want to disobey God, but when treatment and medications aren't effective enough then the person really can't be held fully responsible for punishment because he/she ended their life. So in my opinion it's not a full ""choice"".

I don't ever plan to commit suicide, but I can't say with 100% guarantee that I won't. I am 22 right now,  and I don't anticipate making it to 30. Maybe I'm being ridiculous, but given my past mental health history and struggles and life and past sins, I don't have confidence that I will ever get there. 

And for the record: I am not suicidal right now. I'm just very depressed. What sucks is that when I get depressed I don't/can't do anything. I can barely take care of myself or do anything, not even shower and comb my hair most days. And usually I won't eat much, if ever. So when I get into these stages of severe depression, I don't even pray to God and I fall into sin way more easily. So once I sin because of my depression, I basically run away from God because I think because I missed one day of being faithful, that I will be doomed forever, and I just sin more and more without really a care into the world - again, for the reason that I think I'm already doomed so why bother to try anymore? The only thing I do at that point is just hope that things get better and I can feel like I'm worthy of God's Mercy and Love again, and then get to confession as soon as I can. But I have so much doubt that things will ever change for the better.

But with all of this being put aside, I'm never enough. And that's why I am fearful of God. Because I can never get away from mortal sin, the thing I desperately want to get away from the most, but I also want to get away from all sin. But I fall over and over again, and I beat myself up for it because I always believe I'll never be worthy enough of Heaven. And I also can't fully get behind the concept of purgatory, either. But anyway that's all I wanted to share. Thank you if you made it this far.",Catholicism
Question about being unable to attend church,Tfinnm,1623215835,"I recently took a new seasonal job, it is in pretty much the middle of no where, and the only way for us to go into town is a weekly bus on Saturdays that arrives in town about half an hour after the vigil mass ends. Historically, we've had a catholic priest on site who would hold mass for our staff and visitors on Sunday and a few times throughout the week, but he fell ill a few years ago and finding other priests to fill in has been sporadic at best. Currently, I'm working with the company admin to try to coordinate a way to get people into town in time for mass, but as it stands I'm not confident we'll be able to make it work, so what kinds of other options are there if it doesn't work out?  


We do have limited internet and can stream TV mass, so if we got the Eucharist from the parish in town on Saturday night, then watched live streamed mass on Sunday morning, would that count as attending mass? Obviously this is a bad long term solution, but it would only be for the 2-3 months out there and hopefully by next year we have a priest on site with us again.

Of course, the sacrament of marriage is clearly defined in the CCC and is consistent throughout the tradition of the Catholic Church. The issue of homosexuality (2357) and homosexual purity (2359) is also clearly described.

Regarding tradition - many saints (Augustine, Chrysostom, Gregory the Great, Basil, Aquinas, Bonaventure, Catherine of Siena ...) spoke unequivocally on the issue of homosexual acts as being contrary to nature.

Been reading *The Canterbury Tales* so I wrote a poem that sounds Medieval-y during some down time at work. Hope it brightens up your day :),mjohns112,1623198724,"*Sugarberry*

A temple, carved and stone-wrought,
Once stooped upon a hill, I thought. 
A priest used to sleep there,
Never judging folk, benevolently fair. 

In said temple was a Tabernacle,
Cast in gold, jewel-studded receptacle,
Within it lay the Lord most high,
Enclosed is the Host for those who may die.

One day, a vagabond came this way,
He begged the priest to let stay,
The priest prays and weeps, 
“My flock has grown one sheep!”

“What have you to fill my belly?”
“Sugarberries, I say verily!”
Our drifter brays and whines, 
“Sugarberries! Not fit even for wine!”

And yet, with stomach in rumble,
Grave dug deep, in hand ghost’s shovel,
“Beggars can’t be choosers,
Three sees your heart, can’t fool theirs.”



Out they go, to Sugarberry Grove,
Where chaff is tossed and wheat be wove,
Here surely beggar you shall be tested,
Surely chooser, you shall not be bested. 

A bush, a tree, on berries we dine, 
See them rustle, stand, glisten, shine,
Berries to the poor, tired, sick,
Rubies to the rich, on fire, God’s wick.

And so, the priest and vagabond,
Like a mighty yew and green frond, 
Kneeling deep and heads bowed low,
Hearken O beggar, you reap what you sow.",Catholicism

"Best response to ""From Paul to Valentinus""",Harrichael,1623191430,"TLDR: Best response/establishment of the pope/magisterium in Rome before AD 185.  


I am a protestant leaning heavily towards joining the Catholic Church. I believe that if you start from first principles, a Christian should become Catholic unless they have a reason not to. My main problem with various protestant rebukes of Catholicism is that they lack a cohesive, alternate lense in which to examine tradition and church history.  


I have a problem with ambiguous apostasy utilized by most protestants because it allows them to take the exegesis of various reformers over unanimous statements among church fathers. Essentially, if I am to remain a protestant, I need a way to explain this apostasy in a way that at least certain parts of Church history can be used to limit the wide range of plausible exegesis, otherwise there is either the problem of immense doctrinal discernment complexity or I will believe whatever 21st century me believes the text to mean.  


Even if I found this, there would probably be hurdles to re-tackle seemingly otherwise significant indicators of the Catholic Church (Eucharist, James 2, Chair of Peter in Matthew 16, etc). However, recently watched a [Mike Winger livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5T2nV77WR0) in which he recommended a book, [From Paul to Valentinus](https://www.amazon.com/Paul-Valentinus-Christians-First-Centuries/dp/0800627024/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0). This book attempts to do a comprehensive analysis of history and Mike's takeaway was the lack of a central Bishop in Rome, presumably disproving the Catholic Church. This seems to potentially offer a  cohesive protestant alternative that I have been looking for. What is the best response (book, YouTube video, or otherwise) to this line of thought?

There are a bunch of difficulties, though:

1. Neither of us have any idea how to go about finding a baptism certificate.  An internet search says we can only get it from the baptizing parish, but...
2. My dad is an immigrant from Latin America, and his parents traveled a lot when he was young (including when he was born).  He doesn't know what country he was baptized in -- much less the name of the diocese, and least of all the name of the parish in which he was baptized.  We can guess (either Peru or Argentina), but no clue.  (The only living witness he knows about would be his sister -- who was 5 or 6 years old at the time and was probably baptized in a completely different parish.)

Technically he was registered at the other parish at the time we were married although we both had been attending the parish where we grew up for most sundays and holy days.

We got married at the Church where he was registered (its a prettier and more traditional church). We went through all the interviews and meetings and pre cana and payment information and other bureaucratical nightmares before we were able to get married in the church.

We got married right before covid started and churches shut down so for about a year and a half we were either not technically registered anywhere or we were still technically registered with out parents in two separate parishes. 

Well we get pregnant and felt uncomfortable attending Mass in person until we were both fully vaccinated. Two weeks after I got my second dose, we went to our childhood parish for Mass. One week later, we decided to take home a registration form, which we filled out and returned two weeks ago. 

I'm 8mo pregnant and we want to baptize our baby as soon as possible after birth but due to our uncertain registration status, we are having to deal with bureaucracy again! The parish will accept my ""good standing"" due to my parents registering me as a child and keeping up with my registration, but he will need a ""letter of good standing"" from the other parish since he was registered there.

The devil simply presents the images to you or manipulates them to get you to engage your will with the goal of offending God. 

Fr. Ripperger talks about simply asserting your authority over what belongs to you, ""These thoughts are my responsibility."" I started doing this and I get the temptation, *""Do you really want to be known as owning these kind of thoughts?""* and you have to ignore this temptation and bring them to Jesus, ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.""

Anyone here part of a smaller rite?,Dependent-Summer2043,1623174785,"Tl;dr: Smaller rites, what unique traditions do you have that differ from Roman Catholic? (Like communion and the unique traditions at mass)


I had this idea to maybe try to help Catholics from different parishes and rites to connect with each other. I'm Byzantine rite, and I know our church is small and there aren't many. We dont have a lot of programs or events because we're so small anymore. Lots of Roman Catholics don't know us smaller rites exist either and even within the Latin rite, it seems like we tend to stay isolated as a parish from other parishes and rites (with some exceptions). I guess I feel like we'd all be so much better off learning from each other/working together more if we were more connected.

 I had this realization after talking to a priest at the Roman Catholic church by my house, I was thinking about volunteering there because we don't have the amount of people at my church and I wasnt sure if I even could not being a parishioner. I was pleasantly surprised when he said I definitely could. This also got me thinking of how many smaller parishes/rites have the same issues we do. I could go on about why I feel this way, but I just think its really important to reach people that wouldn't check out the Catholic church otherwise to be able to go somewhere that's more familiar to them culturally. 

Im still way at the beginning of this idea, but I wanted to start checking out different churches and get to know people and the traditions. We have a Maronite church about half an hour from me, so I was going to start there. (I've kind of started going to random churches in my area throughout the week instead of just staying at mine)

This would be my first non Byzantine or Roman Catholic mass. I'm wondering if for all of you in the smaller rites, what unique traditions do you have during the mass (like communion, etc) that are different from Roman Catholic? It's intimidating, I know I feel that way and I don't want to experience too much of a culture shock if I can avoid it 😂.",Catholicism

Did God support the Hussites?,JamieOfArc,1623172061,"In the early 15th century, the was a movement in czech republic called Hussites (after the theologian Jan Hus who Was burnt by the church as a heretic even though its Not clear if he really was one and JP II apologized for it). They conquered large parts of the czech land and were able to constantly defeat the catholic crusaders in battle. The Vatican launched five crusades against the Hussites and outnumbered them and had better trained warriors every time but always lost.
To me it seems like God intervened to let the Hussites win. Is there another possible explanation for the fact that untrained peasants constantly defeated trained warriors in battle despite being outnumbered? Does that mean that the Hussites were on the right path or did He just do it to punish the catholics for their corruption?
The Hussites were basically early Protestants. They criticized that communion under both kinds wasnt given to the laity, the saint veneration, indulgence and the (supposedly) corrupt clergy. They were splitted in a moderate wing (Utraquists) who were Not that far away from catholicism (they believed in the Real presence and had liturgies etc) and the taborites who were very far away from catholicism and were very brutal, they sometimes even killed catholic civilians.

I am taking a shot in the dark that this priest will listen to me and respect me when I am at my most vulnerable, without knowing where his mind is.

Marriage Preparation,baristana,1623153864,"My fiancé and I got engaged about six months ago and recently started marriage preparation as we plan to have a nuptial mass in the Catholic Church.

I don’t have a question so much as a comment about Catholic marriage preparation that truly took me by surprise. There are four other couples besides me and my fiancé in our marriage preparation course. Three of the couples live together. The only couples who do not live together are me and my fiancé as well as one other couple.

I believe I had spiritual warfare dream. I'm quite concerned about it. Any insights will be much appreciated it.,fivecrownpirate,1623129036,"So I dream I was in a wooden church. 
There was this small soul that looked like a old bald priest wearing red. People would place a glass of water where the small soul of the priest was. He would pray for the Eucharist. 
I did this and kneel watching him praying. As he was praying I became aware that where I was kneeling and where the priest soul was praying. There was coffin underneath the concrete flooring. Everyone knew it was a holy monk buried there hence why people place the glass of water there because this monk or the small soul of priest could turn the bread and wine to Body, Blood of Jesus. 
Anyway there I was sitting there and I saw before my eyes the water turning to the Blood of Jesus! I said to myself ""oh my god it's real"" 

Then all of a sudden the priest I think or someone else place there thumb into the cup of blood, and then place there thumb on my forehead. Marking me with a small circle of blood on my forehead. 

I then stood up and turn around and I saw my mother there. She told me that the monk who is buried below under the floors, was a evil monk. I asked how? She told me how when he was a live he faked doing the Holy Communion. Meaning he fooled everyone in the audience at the church that the wine turn to blood and the bread turn to the body.",Catholicism

He currently attends a TLM outside of his own diocese that is in good standing, but basically will talk about how he has doubts that Francis is really the pope, and basically will get really close to saying we haven't had legit popes in a while, though he always says that he is just ""questioning things."" 

Also, while this isn't necessarily bad, he's basically said he's boycotting our diocese due to its response to last years events and doesn't plan on going back to his parish.

If Churchhill had religion he really didn't show it when he permitted the indiscriminate bombing of at least a quarter million refugees in Dresden. And Roosevelt, he certainly had no scruples about selling out the whole of Europe to Soviet Russia, to rape and kill as they saw fit.

It’s a defined dogma that anyone who dies before or having never been Baptized is damned. I honestly think it’s Protestantism and people wanting to virtue signal. Let’s set an example scenario. Jill is born to a non practicing Catholic family. They put off her Baptism and consider it but ultimately fail to bring her to be Baptized. Is Jill damned or are her parents the ones permitted her to be saved through action. (Jesus is the only one who saves I hope you understand what I mean.) If we believe that Jill is saved just because she was not of the age of reason to be judged (about the ages 0-7) then what’s the point of Baptism? Is it merely symbolic of all who die before the age of reason are saved anyway? Are children of Muslim, Buddhism or any other religion saved as well?

Has anyone considered teaching catechism to kids or adults?,Dr_Talon,1623112048,"Since there is a big thread here on recatechizing Catholics about the Eucharist, I have to ask, has anyone here ever thought about teaching RCIA or PSR classes?  I helped teach PSR for a time, and am considering returning to it during the following school year.

My life was changed by an excellent catechist.  I was poorly catechized, and didn’t even know if we believed that the Eucharist was literal or merely symbolic.  I didn’t know there was a difference between mortal sin and venial sin, or that there were any rules about Holy Communion or what sins need to be confessed beyond fasting for an hour.

But in middle school, I had an excellent PSR teacher who was a convert from Lutheranism, along with a great traditional leaning priest.  They answered all my questions (including deeper ones about Arianism and deism), and gave me a great catechesis.  I remember us talking about the differences between Protestants and Catholics (total depravity, the *solas*, etc.), about what makes a valid Sacrament (matter, form, and intention), about the distinction between accident and substance in the Eucharist, and how we know Jesus wasn’t speaking symbolically about the Eucharist.

Now, I was probably above average in intelligence and intellectual curiosity for a middle schooler, and I don’t know what the other kids got out of it, but it changed my life.  I also read our textbook (the Ignatius *faith and life series*) on my own.  But I feel like I went from knowing virtually nothing, to having a solid grounding in the faith, and I consider God placing these teachers in my life to be a pivotal moment for me.  I probably wouldn’t be here without them.

Serving Communion: Re-thinking the Relationship between Primacy and Synodality (and some thoughts in the comments) [xpost from r/Catholic_Orthodox],Shabanana_XII,1623107031,"Sorry if it's becoming a bit spammy to some people, but I thought it'd be interesting to hear your opinions. Anyway, on with the comment:

This is from the ""Saint Irenaeus Joint Catholic-Orthodox Working Group,"" a group of 26 Catholic and Orthodox theologians (split into even groups of 13) working for mutual understanding.

I thought the paper was good, but there was still a nagging question that stayed with me the whole time: how do we deal with Vatican I, and its reaffirmation in Vatican II?

To give background, this paper is talking about the relationship between primacy and synodality, IMO the core separation between Catholicism and Orthodoxy. It goes through history up to today, and, inevitably, talks of Vatican I. It says how it is necessary to look at it in the context of the time, and read its dogmatic statements in that light. Later on, it talks directly about primacy and synodality, and how the two are mutually interdependent on each other, a reaffirmation of my beliefs, as inspired by Kabane. This acknowledgement that Vatican I's interpretations are often too maximalistic, and that primacy needs synodality (I argue Catholicism teaches vice versa, but not that itself), seems a shocking admission on the part of the Catholics of the group that can lead to a common understanding leading to reunification.

However, the question remains, how do we deal with Vatican I and II? First, they answer that dogmas have to be read in their historical context, and I can only partially agree with that. While it could shed light on what they meant when they said X, it does not change X into Y, and I argue Vatican I taught, as it understood itself, that the Pope did not need synodality, and that he was above them and the Church. Reading the historical context, as well as Gasser's *Relatio,* helped shed light on what they meant, but it does not, in my opinion, change the fact that they taught what they taught. The issue extends to Vatican II, which reaffirmed the doctrines of Vatican I by saying the Pope still had the powers given to him (Lumen Gentium 22). Building off all that has been said, I now reach the climax of this comment:

**So, the million-dollar question remains: how can we say that primacy needs synodality, while also saying Vatican I is dogmatic? How can the two be reconciled? How can we say primacy cannot act independently of synodality without falling under the anathemas of Vatican I? This is truly, absolutely, without a doubt the most important question to answer if unity is to be reached.**",Catholicism

How to correctly wear the Rosary,UbiquitousPineapple,1623101270,"So I was at the gym yesterday and after removing my shirts a gentleman saw I was wearing my Rosary around my neck. He was unimpressed and went on a tangent about how I should not do that. I explained why I do as follows:

I complete a decade every time I put on, or take off, my Rosary. First decade is in the morning when I get dressed, second is when I remove my clothes to shower for work, third is when I put on my work clothes, fourth is when I remove my clothes at the gym, and fifth is after showering at the gym and putting on my clothes. I complete all five again when I remove the Rosary before bed.

The Rosary is tucked into my clothes and worn under my undershirt and my collared shirt (I always wear a collared shirt). You can't see it unless I am shirtless. My church has never given an opinion on this, and I wear suits to mass so noone has ever noticed that I wear it. 

Honestly never even thought about it. Items tend to break, or get tangled, in my pockets. I also want it accessible, so I have worn it around my neck for years. Taking it off and putting it on has been a great reminder to complete the decades, as well as go to the gym. Assists with spiritual and physical health. Just suprised me that someone would be so offended by it.

for people with non religious partners,ravlinge,1623097388,"I'd like to ask Catholics, who are married or in relationship with people, who aren't religious or Catholic - how did you solve the question of premarital sex and what's your view on it? Will I burn in hell for occasional sex with my non religious partner before marriage? Even when in my mind I choose to love that person?

I, myself, have been brought up by very religious mother, who converted after dating my religious father for 6 years - now, my dad became more agnostic and doesn't believe anymore, mostly in Church and my mom is borderline fanatic, also the reason of my unbearable fear of Hell and disobeying God. I've been taught by priests that I should wait for marriage and I get the whole idea behind it, but it's not something I totally agree with. And no, I'm not a teenager who wanna have sex so bad. I still feel so unprepared and I feel I only gained some trauma from all these religious rules.

My own father told me the reason why I'm here today is because they had premarital sex and became more close to each others, otherwise he'd break up with my mum easily.

I've been dating one guy with difficult circumstances and he's recovering from many hard life events. He believes in God, he was raised by his Christian grandma, but is more likely agnostic as well and doesn't believe in Church. We aren't in ideal state to get married, but he asked me if he can marry me in the future and started dating me with full knowledge of that we will probably date for 5+ years with no sex, he even said whatever is my final decision, premarital sex or not, he will respect it and tolerate it, but his own opinion is that every healthy relationship needs sex and you can not abstain from it totally.

 It was and still is so against my own skin to marry at age 20-22 just to have sex with someone. I know sex belongs to marriage, I know it's holy but all religious people I know got married at 20 to be able to get more intimate with their partners. 

The thing is, I'm hopeless. I wanna love someone physically without disobeying God, that has granted me with so many wonderful things, even my boyfriend, I know all verses of Bible now about fornication, read so many forums, blogs, and all I do is cry constantly because I don't know what to do, since my friend told me relationship like these (religious and not religious person) don't last long, and they are very, very rare (without one person trying to concert the other one, what is really not my case). 

All I get is fear and terror of my own mind, I feel like God has left me all alone, it's not because I want to do it, want to stay pure, it's because I HAVE TO, otherwise I'd burn in Hell. Maybe choosing a religious partner would be easier, but I opted for my boyfriend and wanna find a RIGHT solution for us.

I'm not going to post all of them here because that is not the point of this post but here was two they had:

Ezekiel 26-28: The City of Tyre will be destroyed and will not be rebuilt.
Ezekiel 29-30: Egypt will be laid to waste and it's people scattered for 40 years, Egypt will then rebuild itself but will never again achieve glory, then Babylon will attack Egypt and carry off her spoils. 

Now I'm not necessarily asking ""were these fulfilled"", but rather more generally:
* Are there unfulfilled prophecy's in the Bible?
    * if so, what are the implementations of that fact that there are unfulfilled prophecy's? 

When I was searching around to see if I could answer this on my own I there was a user on the TrueChristian subreddit that was Catholic that said it was okay if every now and then a prophecy went unfulfilled because of something to do with the ""Genre of Prophecy"" but in my mind if there is a single unfulfilled prophecy in the the Bible that throws into question the truth of at least all the churches that claim that said Prophet is really a Prophet. 

* By ""Unfulfilled Prophecy"" I mean any prophecy that has not been fulfilled and can't be fulfilled at a later date. For instance if someone says ""X world leader will conqueror Y by date Z"" and it does not happen that is a unfulfilled prophecy. I know that there are some messianic/end times prophecy's that have yet to be fulfilled but those are not an issue because we know they will be fulfilled later.",Catholicism

This is a hard saying. Who can accept it?,ProLifeCatholic1535,1623077463,"These are the words of Our Lord Himself. ""After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him."" 

I think the Church needs more of this mindset, specifically when it comes to ""LGBTQ"" issues. Some people's idea of ""compassion"" to these people is watering down the teaching, pretending it doesn't exist, and hoping that they will accept it later. The problem is, these people usually just end up remaining in dissent, or worse, trying to change the Church's teaching. And there's a reason Jesus didn't take this approach.

We need to stop pretending that the Church is super ""LGBTQ friendly"" and simply admit what this teaching is: It is a hard teaching. Many will choose not to accept it. But the Church has the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven and she is the only way to heaven. Remember what Peter said: “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life; and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.”


The Church's teaching on homosexuality is hard. It's not easy for many to accept. Many will leave and we have to accept that. Instead of bending over backwards to de-emphasize the teaching, water it down, or pretend that it doesn't exist, we need to instead, emphasize that the Church is the only way to eternal life. Sadly, this approach seems to have been all but discarded. The Church doesn't want to give people ""hard teachings"" anymore.",Catholicism

Why and when did marriage/having children become exclusive between two people?

Every time I get into a relationship, that person eventually become my everything. And I thought that was how it was meant to be. But at the same time I’m being told that’s unhealthy and I question if thats just society today trying to break the family. Obviously I have priorities for survival, like I care about my job and my health too. But when I’m in a relationship, I guess I neglect friends or become apathetic towards them. Some people seem to be happy with only having their S/O in their life. I know I am, but only for so long. I’m wondering if any Catholic belief or teaching would help me out here.

Nothing matters to him, he invites himself over to my place, can't respect privacy by constantly asking me where I am, if I'm, out with other people he will up-and-down just show up. He pressures me and others into drinking when we meet up. He can't take no for an answer, so I can't give excuses either. When he is around girls he cannot behave, by being very intimate, asking their numbers, etc. I have brought all of these things up with him before numerous times, and nothing has changed.

Witty/interesting metaphors/images you use to explain complex aspects of our faith,TinySaint92,1623060736,"Hi! I’m pretty interested in the metaphors/analogies, images, comparisons and parallelisms you use when trying to understand or explain complex issues of our faith, things that are hard to grasp such as: the Eucharist, the Holy Trinity, the Holy Spirit, pain, God’s love, etc. 

I like these metaphors because (i) they help me assimilate these issues which are complex and (ii) because I am a Sunday school teacher in Spain and kids/teenagers love them. They suddenly aren’t scared of these “weird” teachings from the Church. 

For instance, two of the metaphors I use a lot are: 

\- The Holy Trinity as water, ice, and steam: three things but the same essence. 

\- Pain/Suffering: a little baby undergoing a surgery and not understanding why his parents are allowing this; the baby is incapable of understanding the reasons of his pain: Why are my parents/God allowing this? \[I think I heard this one from my dear Fulton Sheen\]

There were definitely aspects of the Mass I liked, namely the level of reverence I had never previously experienced at Church. But all the little things--like not being able to hear the priest clearly with him facing away and not being able to receive the Blood of Christ--made me really appreciate the Novus Ordo Mass.

"World Politics, Church Politics, and the Solution",GregorianChant007,1623043890,"I am noticing a pattern among everyone in the world. Myself included. We bunch ourselves into imperfect groups with imperfect solutions and then portray those ideas as the way to fix the world. We turn to others in other imperfect groups and we shout and shout. 
I see this in politics: the game is not to put yourself forward as the best person to do the job, the game is to slander others into looking worse than you.
I see this also in Church politics. For instance the whole NO vs TLM argument that is pervasive in our Mother Church. Both forms contain the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ. We can have personal preferences but at the end of the day, isn't that all that matters?

The one way of salvation is that we belong to the Catholic Church. The reason it is our salvation is not because of the imperfect infrastructure of the Body, but because we really have the Perfect Head and He is feeding us.

Christ was not being proud when he said ""I am the way, the truth, and the life"". He was telling us that because He truly is the key for the universe, and He loves us. The only way we can truly move from the eternal clash of this world is to love Christ with our whole heart, mind, and soul. And love our neighbour as ourself for His sake. Please think on a small scale. Really the way out of the mess that the world can be sometimes is for you and me to repent to God, love our wives and our children, our fathers and mothers, and everyone around us unconditionally.
If everyone does this the world would be set on fire, but it can only happen one person at a time. Turn to Christ.

"Broke with Pentecostal GF, want to share my story.",Paacs,1623033252,"Just want some support and explain my experience for anyone who may meet a good girl in a different denomination.

Let's start from the beginning, I fell out of going to church a while ago when I lost my mother so when I met her, I agreed to go to hers as I didn't have one currently. It was loud but I could tell these were Christians, being a small church of 40 people I thought I could get to know everyone. After a few months , I didn't really make any friends there and felt like ""the boyfriend"". That was okay , I got it, she went there for maybe 10-15 years..I had to spend some time to get close to everyone. Also , its a pandemic lol, so I understood the distance. One of the older women there did warn my now ex gf to ""be careful of those Catholics"" and I also got ""teased""(their words) for being raised Catholic.

After about 6 months of going every Sunday, I started getting an awful feeling. The sermons her pastor would preach would be focused on giving the church money. I dont know if I just let this slide before..but I REALLY started to notice it and it's all I could hear and see. There was a Sunday where he asked for people to reach out and let God give them power to give more during this struggling time and have faith..I let it slide until next Sunday, he told those who let God give them power last week to stand so he could acknowledge them. This crossed the line for me heavy. I felt like everyone is brainwashed and their pastor is there to make money, not worship our Lord. It was horrendous to witness and I was shocked no one said anything.

Another weird thing is she'd tell me about all these people who have left(her parents included) , she never told me why her dad decided to leave but I think I found out why.

I tried to bring it up that giving to God with money can be done in anyway(donation to foundation, working /donating at soup kitchens , etc) but she said its not tithing and that our lives will be ruined and God won't bless us if we don't give 10% to the church.

My time at a younger age in Catholic church, I was taught to give when and any amount you can out of love and free will, not to feel obliged and to jist feel good about giving. I was never taught God will withhold blessing or ruin my life if I didn't maintain a 10%...this pentecostal church has opened my eyes to the corruption that can happen in protestantsm. Don't get me wrong, not all churches are like this...but when a church is ran as a buisness...it will corrupt.


I plan to return to my local Catholic Church, I feel God pulled me from there and I love Him for saving me from the false prophet with a silver tongue.

Anyways, just wanted to share my experience of how I returned to Catholicism. Thanks for reading brothers and sisters!",Catholicism

My conflict is that there are so many Protestant denominations and different opinions and interpretations and, honestly, a lot of Protestants I've met just don't seem genuine in their faith.

do Catholics believe Protestants get into heaven?,tirch,1623026090,"Hi everyone, I really enjoy this r/ and I'm learning a lot about Catholicism from reading the posts up here. I have a question I hope isn't too controversial. I know that all the religions that fall under the Christ God believe that there is a heaven and a hell and you can't enter heaven without being a believer.  The protestants have their Born Again thing, and I think all of them require baptism. One of the many things I appreciate about Catholicism is that it requires acts rather than just being ""Born Again"".  My question is, do Catholics generally believe that Protestants won't be in the same heaven as Catholics? Will they be in any heaven when they die? I've read about the Eucharist and how that differs for Catholics and Protestants, and you all have introduced me to the concept of Sol Scriptura, which if I understand correctly is how Protestant religions can go so far off the rails with their whole ""Blessed"" thing.  

So.. my question, do Protestants now enough to make it into the Christ God's heaven? Thanks and I hope I didn't write anything to seem untoward. My question is sincere.",Catholicism

I say I have, I would never want anything bad to happen to him, I don't want justice or revenge, and I don't usually think about it when I'm around him unless something really specific reminds me.

But I still have this awful thing in the back of my head. Whenever he does any damage to our relationship in a normal way (like last year I said something dumb to his wife, totally my fault but not at all intending anyone to get hurt) he said he would never forgive me. 

Oh man, I just about lost it that day. I was crying like crazy out of nowhere and furious that he refused to forgive me after it took me years to forgive him. Something similar happened today, or sort of. He kind of made the implication that he doesn't like who I am anymore and basically is done. Like i said, this is a close family member. This would hurt anyone. But all I can think about is how much I've forgiven. Does that mean I haven't really forgiven him?",Catholicism

Patron Saint for those who feel rejected or are outcasts?,MoriKei,1623021250,"I'm a recent Catholic convert and I have never felt so alone in my life. 

I am a woman who is not traditionally feminine in appearance or personality. I have an interest in ""darker"" and macabre things and always have. I am boisterous, snarky, and oftentimes a bit edgy (trying to correct that). I like to joke around a lot. 

All of this is easily acceptable in the secular world. I would have no problem befriending people if I was not religious or even if I was pagan or a witch because that's the ""cool"" thing to be into with my personality/interests. But slap the Catholic label on me and I'm immediately rejected by people that would otherwise like me. I'm not gonna lie, it hurts.

So I try to make Catholic friends, but I get rejected by that too. I am too ""weird"". I am not meek and quiet. I'm nothing like the pinnacle of being a woman in our faith, as much as I'd love to be like Mary. I've gotten comments before about how weird my skull rosary is and about how Halloween is bad, which is one of my favorite things ever... and also it's literally Catholic in origin, which was funnily enough one of the things that started me researching Catholicism!! And so I have not been able to befriend any Catholic women either. I have heard of Catholic goths that apparently exist but they are not anywhere near me, unfortunately!

So here I am, just trying to be who I always have been, and finding myself alone. My husband doesn't have this problem - there is a lot of overlap in the Catholic + DND/videogames/fantasy crowd. I don't think it's a me problem - I have historically found it easy to make friends when I was not Catholic, but after graduating college and my friends all moving away it's hard to find people now. Online hasn't been any better. A strange amount of women on Catholic social media (at least on Twitter) are explicitly racist. Or they are the opposite and they are Catholic but pro-abortion. And I'm not the biggest fan of social media anyways. 

Maybe this is just my cross to bear. I pray the Litany of Humility daily. I know all I need is God's love and that He loves me as I am. But it hurts. I have had these horrible intrusive thoughts about renouncing my faith so I can be accepted, but I won't. I know I can be myself and be Catholic. I shouldn't have to change who I fundamentally am to be loved by others. 

So here I am asking if there is a Saint whose intercession I should be asking for. Or if there are any prayers similar to the Litany of Humility. I really don't intend for this to come off as ""not like the other girls"" or judgey but I am sure it's coming across as that and I apologize. I would like to add that I was bullied severely as a child/teenager and it wasn't until college that I felt okay to be myself and I made real friends. That experience has certainly colored this situation I find myself in.

Why did some men in Biblical times marry so late?,otatopay,1623019722,"I was reading through the Bible recently, and noticed the number of men in Scripture who are described as marrying and fathering children at older ages - both on an absolute basis, and relative to their wives:

* Abraham was 10 years older than Sarah ([Genesis 17:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+17%3A17&amp;version=NRSVCE)), and after the death of Sarah at the age of 127, Abraham married Keturah and fathered six children with her ([Genesis 21:5,23:1-2,25:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+21%3A5%2C23%3A1-2%2C25%3A1-2&amp;version=NRSVCE))
* Isaac was 40 when he married Rebekah, and 60 when Rebekah bore Esau and Jacob ([Genesis 25:19-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+25%3A19-26&amp;version=NRSVCE))
* Esau was 40 when he married two Hittite women ([Genesis 26:34-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+26%3A34-35&amp;version=NRSVCE)) - although it should be noted that Esau is not held up as a Biblical role model
* Jacob was about 80 when he married Leah ([various passages](https://thebiblemadeplain.com/how-old-was-jacob-when-he-married/))
* Moses was over 40 when he fathered two sons ([Acts 7:22-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+7%3A22-29&amp;version=NRSVCE))
* David was 30 when he began his reign as king of Israel, afterwards taking many wives ([2 Samuel 5:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+5%3A4&amp;version=NRSVCE))
* Zechariah and Elizabeth were ""getting on in years"" when John the Baptist was born ([Luke 1:5-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A5-7&amp;version=NRSVCE))

And from some other, extra-Biblical sources, a similar story:

* According to [Jewish midrash](https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/ruth-midrash-and-aggadah), Ruth was 40 and Boaz was 80 when they married 
* According to [apocryphal sources](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0805.htm), Joseph was 40 when he took his first wife, who died when he was about 89 - after which point, he took as his second wife the Virgin Mary

Honorable mention: even in modern times, a couple of Popes were born to fathers of advanced age:

* Pope St. Pius X was born in 1835 to Giovanni Battista Sarto, \~43, and Margherita Sanson, \~22 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_X#Early_life_and_ministry))
* Pope Benedict XVI was born in 1927 to Joseph Ratzinger, Sr.,50, and his wife Maria, 43 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_of_Pope_Benedict_XVI))

Help a protestant understand Catholicism,CalebTheChosen,1623017629,"Hello dear Catholics

I was raised protestant, and have never paid much mind to why I was in the denomination I was in. From the age of 15-23 I was lacking faith, until I read the Bible for the first time, and regained my faith. But many of the things I read I had never heard in my own church. Most surprising was Matthew 16: 17-19

 **17** And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. **18** And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock\[[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-23690b)\] I will build my church, and the gates of hell\[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-23690c)\] shall not prevail against it. **19** I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed\[[d](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-23691d)\] in heaven.” 

This made me realize that Peter was the first pope of the Church founded by Jesus himself. Knowing this, it seems obvious that Catholicism is the ""correct"" version of Christianity.

LAUDA SION SALVATOREM — Sequence for the Mass of the Feast of Corpus Christi,you_know_what_you,1623013090,"*Lauda Sion Salvatorem* is the sequence prescribed for the Mass of the Feast of Corpus Christi. It was written by St. Thomas Aquinas around 1264, at the request of Pope Urban IV for the then-new Mass, along with *Pange lingua*, *Sacris solemniis*, *Adoro te devote* and *Verbum supernum prodiens*, which are now used in the Divine Office.

What follows is a prose translation of the hymn by Fr. Joseph Connelly.

It's amazing how much doctrine St. Thomas stuffed into this beautiful hymn!

---

**ZION, PRAISE YOUR SAVIOR.** Praise your Savior. Praise your leader and shepherd in hymns and canticles. Praise him as much as you can, for he is beyond all praising and you will never be able to praise him as he merits. But today a theme worthy of particular praise is put before us—the living and life-giving bread that, without any doubt, was given to the Twelve at table during the holy supper. Therefore let our praise be full and resounding and our soul's rejoicing full of delight and beauty, for this is the festival day to commemorate the first institution of this table.

At this table of the new King, the new law's new Pasch puts an end to the old Pasch. The new displaces the old, the reality the shadow and light the darkness. Christ wanted what he did at the supper to be repeated in his memory. And so we, in accordance with his holy directions, consecrate bread and wine to be salvation's Victim.

Christ's followers know by faith that bread is changed into his flesh and wine into his blood. Man cannot understand this, cannot perceive it; but a lively faith affirms that the change, which is outside the natural course of things, takes place. Under the different species, which are now signs only and not their own reality, there lie hid wonderful realities. His body is our food, his blood our drink. And yet Christ remains entire under each species. The communicant receives the complete Christ—uncut, unbroken and undivided. Whether one receive or a thousand, the one receives as much as the thousand. Nor is Christ diminished by being received. The good and the wicked alike receive him, but with the unlike destiny of life or death. To the wicked it is death, but life to the good. See how different is the result, though each receives the same. Last of all, if the sacrament is broken, have no doubt. Remember there is as much in a fragment as in an unbroken host. There is no division of the reality, but only a breaking of the sign; nor does the breaking diminish the condition or size of the One hidden under the sign.

Behold, the bread of angels is become the pilgrim's food; truly it is bread for the sons, and is not to be cast to dogs. It was prefigured in type when Isaac was brought as an offering, when a lamb was appointed for the Pasch and when manna was given to the Jews of old.

Jesus, good shepherd and true bread, have mercy on us; feed us and guard us. Grant that we find happiness in the land of the living. You know all things, can do all things, and feed us here on earth. Make us your guests in heaven, co-heirs with you and companions of heaven's citizens. Amen. Alleluia.

Questions about Catholicism principle vs orthodox principle. Tradition or revelation?,Feeling-Meaning,1623000509,"Howdy folks. Traversing the differences of the Catholic and Orthodox church. One of the biggest differences that I see is that orthodoxy seems to put huge importance on early occurrences of the church. The closer it happened to the beginning of the church, the higher the regard that they hold it. I understand that. But, the Catholics seem to emphasize that the church was a seed that was planted, and that it will continue to change and grow through more understanding and revelation. I also understand that. 

I really see both. I understand how early tradition would be held in a higher regard. But I also see how for the first while, the church's understanding did grow as a seed of a tree would. So why would it randomly stop at some point and switch to just preserving that growth instead of continuing to nurture that growth through continued revelation.

My sister in law is not religious, but she eventually agreed to meet with my priest to discuss the process. She said she was super offended by the priest, who told her and her partner that they should get married. My priest also explained that it’s not enough to just baptize the children, they will also need to raise the kids in the faith as well. My sister in law said that she doesn’t want to raise her kids catholic because she doesn’t agree with the sexual/marriage teachings of the church (i.e. she believes in abortion and gay marriage). 

This made me really sad to hear, especially that she is now even more turned off by the Catholic Church because the priest said that she should be married to the father of her children.

"What to do, I wonder (xpost from r/Catholic_Orthodox)",Shabanana_XII,1622995719,"So, I've been making some interesting advances the past month or so on the dogmas of Vatican I, and have seen repeatedly that there is a reason this schism has gone on for a long time, and it's that there are arguments on both sides. And, sometimes, I wonder whether I have made the right choice in choosing my ""side."" I grew up Catholic, so it's particularly relevant for me, since ""ex-Catholics,"" assuming Catholicism is right, are pretty screwed. I find myself wondering whether the feeling in my heart that I'm making a mistake is due to my upbringing (and some minor spiritual trauma that afflicted me for a couple years regarding mortal sin and confession), or the Holy Spirit telling me I'm wrong. My heart says the latter, I admit, but my mind still isn't sure which to believe, and I'm not sure which to trust. I think to myself of Vatican I, and I just can't see myself believing in it... but is it because of genuine grievances, or hardness of heart and rebellion against authority? I can never know, again. I think sometimes that I would, if it were possible, be both Orthodox and Catholic, to hopefully be ""covered"" either way, but it'd be pretty useless if I didn't believe the dogmas anyway. And I don't know if all this is confusion; or if I know it deep down inside me, and am just being prideful for not wanting to be seen as a Catholic after flaunting myself as an Orthodox for the past couple years.

I wish I could just be an agnostic on the subject and continue being Orthodox, but then I think I should be continuing my research, as I have an obligation to follow it where it leads, even if it means stopping being Orthodox. But I'm just not sure what to believe, and this has been pretty consistent for the past couple years, though in vacillating degrees. Behind all this, every word, of course, is the fact that I don't have the strongest desire to go to hell, personally, so I don't want to do the thing that would lead me there, but I just don't know whether that's becoming a ""heretical"" Catholic or remaining a ""schismatic"" Orthodox... or, again, maybe I do know the answer, and am just being prideful and hard of heart.

2. A. Lack of knowledge- you have heard that Jesus is the real Presence, but not listened to the words.

B. Lack of love- Fr. Walter Ciszek (Book, He Leadeth Me)- clandestine Mass in Russia under the threat of death - priests went without food to keep the Eucharistic fast- their love of the Eucharist.

3. The Mass is what it means to be Catholic.

4. The Eucharist is God's greatest gift

5. We will never love the Eucharist until it costs us our time, our health, our life.

I Have A Habit Of Watching Gore..Is That Bad?,WhenTheSunBleeds,1622990781,"Unfortunately I am being 100% serious here. I confess with shame that I have been into gore for a while now. This started when I was 18 years old. Before I started watching gore I would be repulsed and anger when others shown it to me. I genuinely believed such sites should be illegal. Come 2019, with a lot of stress and difficulty plauging my life( Almost dropped out of school, stress from work, and relationships/family issues) I was deeply depressed. I was under a lot of stress and feeling like shit..months prior I lost my chance to be with a girl who really liked me and that I really liked, and a good friend of mine passed away. Needless to say I was in a bad place( Things have since improved dramatically)

Anyways as a result of my dissatisfaction with life, I looked to the internet to find those faring off worse than me. I overheard a story online where some psycho sent his ex a link to cartel killing videos as a threat..and being genuinely curious I wanted to see them for myself. Now prior to call of this, I was deeply into horror films and I enjoyed classic slashers like Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street. Being a horror addict, I figured this videos wouldn't bother me. "" They can't be that bad, if they were, they would be illegal"" I told myself. Dumb ass. You stupid brainless dumb ass. So I saw some of the Narco videos, and they disturbed me greatly..but I was curious to see more. I felt slightly better knowing I was far from those type of situation and had a relatively manageable and easy life compared to others. However the videos bothered me for a while, with one video( I won't say the name or provide details) nearly traumatizing me and giving me nightmares. 

After I got over my disgust for that video, nothing could bother me anymore. I began to watch gore almost daily, and I would download videos and show them to my friends. I would spam KIK chat rooms with the worst gore because I thought it was funny. Needless to say I never kicked my gore habbit and I continue to frequent reality news and shock sites. Its disgusting but also very entertaining. As a result of this I fell very disconnected from the world, and void of most emotions. I am indifferent to many things now, and I lost all of my innocence completely. I will never unsee those images and videos, and I will never unhear those screams of pain and terror..and I am strangely ok with that. Is any of this normal??

TLDR: Started watching gore out of morbid curiosity and to cope with some depression, ended up almost getting traumatised but am now indifferent to call human suffering. I watch gore fun and I am ashamed of myself but I can't bring myself to stop. The stuff I habe seen will give most people nightmares and PTSD, but I remain indifferent to it fall as if it were a mundane occasion. Is this normal? Am I doing any damage to myself?",Catholicism
UNAPPROVED MARIAN APPARITIONS,Beautiful-Dust1,1622990618,"I've been looking into some unapproved Marian Apparitions like ""Our Lady of Medjugorje,"" ""Our Lady of Mount Carmel of Garabandal,"" and ""Our Lady of America, the Immaculate Conception"" e.t.c. These apparitions have never been directly or indirectly approved by the Holy See as plausible. Yet, I see YouTube Channels dedicated to these apparitions, insisting that they were real. Many videos claiming ""prophetic"" warnings and messages from Our Lady about the state of the world, the end times, e.t.c.   I've also seen ""Novenas to our Lady of Garabandal"" and ""Prayer to Our Lady of Medjugorje"". There are statues of Our Lady of Medjugorje and Garabandal you could buy online.  There are people going on ""pilgrimages"" to the sites of these supposed apparitions. There are big movements promoting these apparitions despite them not being approved by the Vatican.

The wikipedia page on the Garabandal apparition states: **Th*****e Holy See has never approved even indirectly the Garabandal movement, that it has never encouraged or blessed Garabandal promoters or centers. Rather the Holy See deplores the fact that certain persons and Institutions persist in formatting the movement in obvious contradiction with the dispositions of ecclesiastical authority and thus disseminate confusion among the people especially among the simple and defenseless.*** 

 Honestly and personally speaking, I'm not sure what to believe about them. One part of me wants to dismiss these ""apparitions"" as superstitious or fake. A lot of the videos on the apparitions honestly either appear made up or events that could totally be explained by natural phenomena but being portrayed as supernatural. The other part of me feels guilty for doubting, especially remembering what Christ said in John 20:29  **blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.** 

Just wanting to hear your thoughts on unapproved apparitions, in general. 

1. How does the Church even determine what is real and what is a hoax/fake. 
2. Wouldn't it be sinful to pray to ""Our Lady of Garabandal"" for example considering the Church has not approved it. Or to have a statue of Our lady of Medjugorje in your home. Would it be illicit for a priest to bless such statues?
3.  Where do people draw the line with these apparitions. If it has not been approved by the Church, how are these so-called visionaries and their followers even certain that the entity that appeared to them is of God and not some other demonic spirit? I mean, 2 Corinthians 11:14 states  **And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.**",Catholicism

I almost got a beef with my uncle,DamageOwn3108,1622987315,"So, every Sunday I go visit some distant relatives because I live in a remote area of my country and I'm mostly alone all the week. I am practising catholic (go to church, learn the faith and the Bible, etc), he is not practising and didn't made his confirmation. My uncles are both liberal and I'm not, I'm purely catholic and my faith is the same as my grandparents and the first Christians too. 

So, this morning, he took me home, after I had a mass with a baptism and first communion. We talked about it and I explained that the order of the sacraments was not always the same and it changed over time, because for baptism, for example, people were afraid their kids died before the baptism (as it often happened untill the advance of medicine). So with that conversation, I don't remember why, but he complained that the church doesn't allow women to be ordained and priests to marry and I tried to hold my breath and explain that women are not ordained because they never were and it doesn't necessarily mean they are better or worse, and tried to point the example of Mary, by saying ""Who was more important in the history of Christianity? Was Mary, because she was the one to conceive Christ, she was the very first one to say yes to God."" And he very quickly interrupted me ""*No, both sexes are equal, both genders are equal!!*"" and ""*So you are saying God discriminates based on gender?*"" And I tried to tell I wasn't saying God discriminates or anything, cuz he doesn't, I just tried to tell women are not priestess because they never were and we don't have the power to make them in the first place!! 

He then proceeded to tell that the church was loosing people because she doesn't ""modernise"" and doesn't ""adapt"" to the present and remain ""dull"" and I said that the church doesn't have to, because religion is not like a molding paste and people have to follow the same religion and the same God. He then told me he expected more of me and said I needed to be more ""open minded"" and more ""tolerant"" to different views (probably implying I was having a backwards mentality, he didn't say that, but I just concluded by myself, if you're smart half a sentence is sufficient for you to understand). I then said ""Tolerant? Your are being intolerant to me, Stop being intolerant!"" while he replied ""*I'm not being intolerant*"" and I said ""You are being intolerant yes, you are saying your way of thinking is superior to mine!"" Then he got all furious and asked me ""*Where did I say I was superior to you in any way!?*"" (Ok, so it translated badly, I didn't meant he was *saying*, but I meant he was ""implying"" or ""assuming"" his ideas were better than mine and therefore, I should change my mind). He looked very man's and said ""*I don't wanna have this conversation anymore with you, go back to home! Now!!*"" (We had already arrived their house).

I just got astonished by the way this conversation went. We started all calm and friendly and then he almost beat me up for *refusing to accept his way of view?* what do you think about this? Was I intolerant? Am I wrong?

You know, today this morning, I was wondering, while singing in the mass if I would ever have the courage to stand up to the people of this world and defend God with my life if needed. Sometimes I doubt about my faith, but now I see my actions speak for themselves. It reminded me of a verse from the Bible, a very important thing Jesus warned us about:  ""If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you."" John 15:19

Quest for purpose and meaning in life,forevergeeks,1622987298,"Man is the only creature that needs purpose and meaning in life. 

He is the only one that needs a reason for his existence. 

And if he thinks he is immune to such thing, 

Sooner or later he will be confronted with such questions, why do I exist, and what is my purpose in life?

And inevitably the quest to answer these questions will draw him to God.

In his heart, he will know God is what he is looking for, but in his mind he will deny it. Only stupid people believe in spaghetti monsters flying in the sky he will say to himself, and I'm not stupid, so his quest will continue, and so he will go on looking for a purpose to live his life. 

Now you might be wondering. 

Why God though, why is he our purpose?

Because God created us in his essense, and therefore we are predisposed to certain things that can only come from God such as love and truth. 

So it is through love that we find meaning in what we do. Money, status, etc, won't have any meaning and purpose if we are devoid of love. 

We won't have any peace in our hearts if we don't live a life of truth. 

God is the embodiment of all the virtues we are predisposed of, that's why it's impossible for a man to deny the existence of God and be at peace with himself at the same time, because by denying God he is denying the very essence that makes him stable.",Catholicism

For example maybe this person is pro-choice in certain limited situations, or that married couples who already have children should be able to use birth control, or that maybe gay people in committed relationships aren’t sinning by having sex.  

The first response to having a disagreement like that is of course to pray over it and try to conform ones conscience to the teachings of the Church.  But that failing, what should one do?

So with that conversation, I don't remember why, but he complained that the church doesn't allow women to be ordained and priests to marry and I tried to hold my breath and explain that women are not ordained because they never were and it doesn't necessarily mean they are better or worse, and tried to point the example of Mary, by saying ""Who was more important in the history of Christianity? Was Mary, because she was the one to conceive Christ, she was the very first one to say yes to God."" And he very quickly interrupted me ""*No, both sexes are equal, both genders are equal!!*"" and ""*So you are saying God discriminates based on gender?*"" And I tried to tell I wasn't saying God discriminates or anything, cuz he doesn't, I just tried to tell women are not priestess because they never were and we don't have the power to make them in the first place!! 

He then proceeded to tell that the church was loosing people because she doesn't ""modernise"" and doesn't ""adapt"" to the present and remain ""dull"" and I said that the church doesn't have to, because religion is not like a molding paste and people have to follow the same religion and the same God. He then told me he expected more of me and said I needed to be more ""open minded"" and more ""tolerant"" to different views (probably implying I was having a backwards mentality, he didn't say that, but I just concluded by myself, if you're smart half a sentence is sufficient for you to understand). I then said ""Tolerant? Your are being intolerant to me, Stop being intolerant!"" while he replied ""*I'm not being intolerant*"" and I said ""You are being intolerant yes, you are saying your way of thinking is superior to mine!"" Then he got all furious and asked me ""*Where did I say I was superior to you in any way!?*"" (Ok, so it translated badly, I didn't meant he was *saying*, but I meant he was ""implying"" or ""assuming"" his ideas were better than mine and therefore, I should change my mind). He looked very man's and said ""*I don't wanna have this conversation anymore with you, go back to home! Now!!*"" (We had already arrived their house).

I just got astonished by the way this conversation went. We started all calm and friendly and then he almost beat me up for *refusing to accept his way of view?* what do you think about this? Was I intolerant? Am I wrong?

You know, today this morning, I was wondering, while singing in the mass if I would ever have the courage to stand up to the people of this world and defend God with my life if needed. Sometimes I doubt about my faith, but now I see my actions speak for themselves. It reminded me of a verse from the Bible, a very important thing Jesus warned us about:  ""If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you."" John 15:19

"Antoni Gaudi is on the road to Beatification - and maybe his greatest miracle will be the amazing Sagrada Familia, the Basilica in Barcelona consecrated by Pope Benedict, which has lead to the surprising conversions of many of the craft people working on it",TJB74,1622972692,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* As the great theologian Von Balthazar suggested one of the most effective pathways to God is through Beauty &gt; Goodness &gt; Truth 
* The Catalan Architect became obsessed with his magnus opus, the basilica of the Sagrada Familia (dedicated to the Holy Family) and although when he began it he was not a practicing Catholic, 40 years later he was a daily mass goer and confessor, and died in relative poverty having declined very lucrative offers from America and France- but his real wealth was in the stunning church he left behind and the plans for its completion ......  this already brings 20million people a year to Barcelona just to see it and I believe it will lead to many converts
* Gaudí's Catholic faith intensified during his life and this earned him the nickname ""God's Architect”. When hassled by people about why progress was taking so long (The Sacre Couer in Paris which had begun a few years before had long been dedicated and consecrated) Gaudi would say 'My Client is in no rush'
* It seems that while Gaudi was working on the joyful nativity facade that the architect ""saw the person of Jesus Christ"". Slowly, his life took on an ascetic pattern. When he was in his early 40s, he nearly died fasting for lent, and only began to eat again when a priest reminded him of his mission to build the basilica.

"San Rafael Guízar y Valencia, ruega por nosotros",eschatom,1622959735,"(Laudate) +Profile


One of eleven children born to Prudenzio Guizar and Natividad Valencia, wealthy and pious land owners. Ordained in 1901. Conducted missions throughout Mexico. Founded the Congregation of Missionaries of Our Lady of Hope in 1903. Apostolic missionary in 1905. Spiritual director in the major seminary of Zamora, Mexico. Used his family's money to found a school for poor girls. Founded two colleges for boys.


In 1911 a state persecution of the Church began. His Congregation was dissolved and his missionary work was prohibited, so Father Raphael continued his work illegally. He founded a Catholic magazine in Mexico City, which the government quickly shut down. Raphael went on the road, disguised as a travelling merchant or musician, ministering to the poor and preaching when he could. He was shot at several times by soldiers, and condemned to death in absentia. In 1916 the authorities were so close on his trail that Raphael fled Mexico, first to the United States and then to Guatemala where he spent a year preaching missions. Preached in Cuba from 1917 to 1919. Named bishop of Veracruz-Jalapa, Mexico on 1 August 1919; he received word of the appointment while preaching in Havana. He continued his missionary work in Colombia, but finally returned to Veracruz, Mexico on 4 January 1920.


The government persecution of the Church escalated. The diocesan seminary was shut down; Bishop Raphael transferred his students to Mexico City and continued their training covertly. In 1931 Governor Tejada of Veracruz decreed that there could only be one priest per 100,000 Catholics; Raphael shut all his churches in protest. Tejeda ordered that Raphael be shot on sight; Raphael went straight to the governor's palace and walked into his office. Tejeda feared the uprising that killing such a man would cause, and revoked the death sentence; Raphael spent the rest of his days fighting to continue the work of the Church in the face of government opposition.+


+Rafael was born and died in Mexico and he was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI.+


+Reading


The Gospel that we have heard helps us to understand the figure of Saint Rafael Guízar y Valencia, Bishop of Vera Cruz in the beloved Mexican Nation, as an example of one who has left all to ""follow Jesus"". This Saint was faithful to the divine Word, ""living and active"", that penetrates the depth of the spirit (cf. Hebrews 4:12). Imitating the poor Christ, he renounced his goods and never accepted the gifts of the powerful, or rather, he gave them back immediately. This is why he received ""a hundred fold"" and could thus help the poor, even amid endless ""persecutions"" (cf. Mark 10:30). His charity, lived to a heroic degree, earned him the name, ""Bishop of the poor"". In his priestly and later episcopal ministry, he was an untiring preacher of popular missions, the most appropriate way at the time to evangelize people, using his own ""Catechism of Christian Doctrine"". Since the formation of priests was one of his priorities, he reopened the seminary, which he considered ""the apple of his eye"", and therefore he would often say:  ""A Bishop can do without the miter, the crosier and even without the cathedral, but he cannot do without the seminary, since the future of his Diocese depends on it"". With this profound sense of priestly paternity he faced new persecutions and exiles, but he always guaranteed the formation of the students. The example of St Rafael Guízar y Valencia is a call to his brother Bishops and priests to consider as fundamental in pastoral programs, beyond the spirit of poverty and evangelization, the promotion of priestly and religious vocations, and their formation according to the heart of Jesus! - Pope Benedict XVI, from the canonization homily of Saint Raphael+",Catholicism
A question about the proper application of Just War Theory in a scenario.,KingXDestroyer,1622959421,"Hi friends, I have recently been thinking about just war theory, and how it should be applied in specific scenarios. I worked out how it would work in simple scenarios, but I have a more complex scenario that seems more difficult to parse.

Scenario: Say there are two States fighting a war. For the sake of argument, we will call one country Lemuria, the other we will call Hyperborea. Both nations are autocracies. Now, Lemuria is the aggressor in this war, and is fighting for the conquest of land they have no real claim to. This war lasts for many years. In the 10th year of the war, the old Lemurian monarch dies and is succeeded by his son. Now the new Lemurian monarch is a believer in just war theory, and thus wishes to make peace, status quo ante bellum. By this point the war is in a stand still, with Lemuria holding only a slight advantage. The Lemurian monarch offers to pay compensation for waging an unjust war of aggression and agrees to hold mutual war crime tribunals. But at this point, Hyperborea refuses to accept anything but unconditional surrender. The Lemurian monarch knows that if he surrenders, it is very likely his entire country will suffer unjust conditions. But if he continues the fight, more deaths, military and civilian will follow. More war crimes will happen. Victory is probable, but the peace will be unsatisfactory to Lemuria's citizens and soldiers, who will be angry that Lemuria fought for nothing.

Question: Should the Lemurian monarch surrender, or should he fight it out until the end?

I err on the side of Lemuria, since it seems to be the one currently negotiating fair and just conditions for both parties.
(I loosely base this scenario on Austria-Hungary during the First World War when Blessed Karl became Emperor).",Catholicism

Talking to god,Spobe_,1622947138,"In recent months my relationship with God has been ""weird"" (for me) to say the least, I was pondering about the world and started thinking where will I go with my life, I still was very indecisive over It and just said in these exact words ""hey god, can you help me? I really don't know what career ill take to my life"" and for a good 13 minutes I forgot about it, then it came to my mind to talk about this with my father, I asked him to come for a walk with me (keep in mind it was 23:00h) and he agreed, he gave me so much insight on what was his life and what he learned, and I discovered somethings about myself and my way of processing information that cleared my mind, and made me see in a certainly blurry way where to go, then, 2 weeks pass, and for no particular reason, I decide to go to church to a mass, i didnt think much of It, i ignored most of it, then I wanted to go on the balcony to pray over somethings in my life, some time goes by and I look at the sky and see a lot of stars and think: (huh, seeing Andromeda would be cool) then I said to god in these exact same words again: ""god, for the most things I normally ask to you, I'll ask another in a more casual way, if it wouldn't be a problem, could you inspire the genius's working with space research? I'd really like to see other galaxies"". 1 minute passes and I suddenly want to study physics and mathematics, and on the same second I fell on my knees on tears, yet tears of happiness, I still couldn't believe what just happened, but it didn't really mattered to me, I had a smile all around my head and since then I saw clearly where to go in my life. 

I honestly just shed a tear while writing this, to think god just came and said to me ""you can do everything."" And I'm very happy even 2 months after, but this story is just to give more context on what I've been thinking and got me in doubt: 

is it ok to treat god more like you would treat your father/mother/parental figure instead of treating god like well, god?

I've been thinking about it even prior to my night walk with my dad, that looked to make sense to me when I remembered ""heavenly father"" or as in how we call ourselves ""brothers and sisters"", to me god wasn't god, to me god was my dad, my mom, my uncle, my grandmother and grandfather, god was my family, what wants to see me well and happy, I always seen god as in this higher level, which, don't get me wrong, he is, but it felt like I was going to never comprehend god himself, but after those experiences, it felt like he was standing next to me, talking to me like you were talking to me, there wasn't really a ""holy"" element to it, it was just...

I recently committed a sin related to lust that two of my confessors have said is a venial sin in my case.

This sin involved looking at social media and an immodestly dressed model with lust.

Both priests have said that these sins are venial for me and one even said that the devil is trying to keep me from communing by making me think that these sins are mortal.
The other priest said that I should try to not go to confession for a month because of my scrupulosity.

The church I found that I intend to go to doesn't begin RCIA until September. They referred me to another local church that does them year round. I can't imagine I would attend that particular church, as they use a guitar during Mass, and without making a judgement on that, personally it would distract and lessen the sacred beauty of the Mass for me. So I am wondering if it is acceptable to go to their RCIA classes, while attending Mass and getting baptized into the other church?

Or is it a situation where I would need to do RCIA and Mass, and baptism all at the same church? Which would mean waiting until September, and just attending Mass as a non-member until then.

The Cross you Bear,IrinaSophia,1622927644,"A troubled and burdened man prayed and prayed that God would lift his 	burden. Day after day he prayed that his life would be easier and he begged 	for God's intervention. 
	
One day, Jesus came to the man and asked, ""My child, what troubles you?"" 	The man replied that his life was full of turmoil and that it had become too 	much to bear. He again asked for help stating that he just couldn't continue 	to go on. 
	
Jesus, feeling the man's anguish, decided help was in order. The man was 	so happy that his prayers were about to be answered that his burden already 	felt lighter. 
	
Jesus took the man to a room and stopped in front of the door. When he 	opened the door, what the man saw was amazing. The room was filled with 	crosses; little crosses, big crosses, giant crosses. The man, bewildered, 	looked at Jesus and asked how this would help him. Jesus explained that each 	cross represented a burden that people carry; small burdens, big burdens, 	giant burdens -- and every burden in-between. 
	
At this point, Jesus offered the man the opportunity to choose his 	burden. The man, so excited that he was finally able to have some control 	over his life, looked around the room for just the right cross. He saw a 	tiny little cross way back int he corner. It was the smallest cross in the 	room. After a bit of thought, he pointed to the cross and said, ""That one, 	Lord. I want that one."" Jesus asked, ""Are you sure, my son?"" The man quickly 	replied, ""Oh, yes Lord. Most definitely, yes.""

"Thank your priest, pray for your priest!",GregorianChant007,1622919923,"Hello. I'll quickly put this post into context.
What's inspiring me to write this is that I'm a seminarian, living in a rectory with 2 priests over the summer. Seeing their ministry close-up with an ""inside scoop"" so to speak has given me a fresh appreciation for how far past the basic service of their parish their ministry really goes.
Often when I'm cooking in the common areas I overhear phone calls and the like. If you imagine someone who's posting a somewhat misguided question about mortal sin on this subreddit, that kind of conversation is something a priest has on a very regular basis. And I know personally when I have troubles or questions of that sort, a priest is the first person I turn to. They're truly the spiritual father of their people. And between the priest's human weakness and that of the people, it's a pretty hard job.

So that brings me back to the point of my post: pray for your priest! He really does need it every day. And thank him as well. A simple ""thank you Father for your willingness to minister to us with dedication and love"" goes a long way.",Catholicism

I've read that thinking the names of a Demon or thinking about them can summon them. May or may not be true though.

I didn't have any problems praying or anything, and I've done the sign of the cross dozens of times, over and over again.

Eucharist from a strictly medical perspective,insignificantdaikini,1622912175,"Hi All, I'm mostly a chronic lurker here on reddit but I was at a friends, also Catholic, the other day helping move some furniture when we started discussing the Eucharist. I brought up a way that I like to think of and understand the Eucharist and I could tell it helped them a lot. So I thought if it helped them maybe it could help others and of course I appreciate any feed back.

Consider the way an anti venom is made, for example for poisonous snakes, a small non lethal dose of the venom is injected into a larger animal often a cow for example. The cow's body is able to fight the venom and produce the necessary antibodies required to defeat the venom. Those antibodies are then given to a bite victim and often saves lives.

Naturally death is the ultimate ailment of which there is no non lethal dose. You may already see where I'm going with this. There is only one Person in the history of humanity who faced death and was able to defeat it, and fortunately, He left us ""the antibodies"". And also fortunately for use we don't line up Sunday mornings for a medical injection, but for the ultimate mysteries of the Catholic Church, hidden in Bread and Wine. 

For it's entire history the Catholic Church has taught that the bread and wine on the altar literally becomes the flesh and blood of Christ, and very important to remember, the **resurrected** Flesh and Blood of Christ. We still must face the bite and sting of death, but our Savior gives us the tools for it's defeat, not just spiritually but also from a strictly medical perspective.

Of course this is just one simple thought on the mysteries of the Eucharist, and in no way a full explanation or anything. Just maybe a helpful perspective for us in this age of science and medicine.

2 Questions about the Prayer for Spiritual Communion,WanderingCityDweller,1622901051,"Act of Spiritual Communion:
My Jesus,  I believe that You are present in the Most Holy Sacrament.  I love You above all things,  and I desire to receive You into my soul.  Since I cannot at this moment receive You sacramentally,  come at least (#1) spiritually into my heart.  I embrace You as if (#2) You were already there  and unite myself wholly to You.  Never permit me to be separated from You.  Amen.

1. Why does the prayer say “at least”spiritually? I have seen versions of this prayer where “at least” is removed, but it does seem a bit belittling to the spiritual union of communion. I’m assuming the addition of “at least” was for the purpose of distinction between sacramental and spiritual - but I am still kinda confused about that distinction.

2. Why does the prayer say “as if You were already there”? Isn’t Christ always in our hearts calling us to embrace? When I hear this phrasing it seems like one embraces Christ in the prayer and then He slowly walks away until you receive communion again - which I don’t think is accurate. It would be accurate I think to say people walk away from Christ, but not the other way around.

Any help to clear this confusion is greatly appreciated :)",Catholicism

I never deserved my father (or mother, but today is about my dad). To paint you an accurate picture of him will be hard, but I’m going to try my best.
Every morning on my own birthday, I’m 22 now, he would wake me up to tell me the story of how it went down. How my mom and him were shoveling mulch for her garden, because he knew how much my mother loved tending to flowers and vegetables. How she had her first contractions, and how she said she would be fine, she wanted to finish shoveling the mulch before heading to the hospital. How it was hours of terrifying excitement and labor, how unbelievable it was to hold me in his arms for the first time. How he cried and cried to hold his firstborn daughter, and how he truly saw God for the first time, that it was impossible to deny the existence of something greater when a love so intense was felt between parent and child.
When I was away for university, my dad would call me in the morning to tell me that story. It was the best part of my day.
When I was a young child, he would play with me no matter what the game was. My mom fondly reminisces about how the two of us would play with My Little Pony toys.

He loved my mother as much as he loved me and my brother. There was nothing he wouldn’t do for that woman. When my parents first started dating, my dad was still in the Navy, so he was on the other side of the planet for a while. My mom would send him care packages and letters, complete with cookies that his navy buddies would bother for a share. He had an admittedly dumb sense of humor, and whenever he cracked one of his classically dumb jokes and my mom laughed, he would look at her with so much love. Then he would look at me and/or my brother and say, “After [blank] amount of years, your mom still laughs at my stupid jokes.” They were together for a better part of thirty years, and my father made sure that I knew a long-lasting relationship was possible through God. We aren’t all entitled to happiness in a unity of marriage, that you’ll have fights and bad days. However, those fights will pale in comparison to a lasting love verified before the eyes of our Creator. I can only hope that one day, I too am in a marriage as devout as the one my mom and dad had.

The relationship my dad had with my brother, who is now 19, was different, obviously. Though he was the second child born into our family, my brother was never loved or treated any differently than me. It was wonderful to see my dad take part in my brother’s interests, to play Mario Kart Double Dash with him, to instill the importance of being the religious leader of your family. He eventually started to take my brother with him to morning CCD classes, and they would go to Catholic Men’s Conferences (which both of them would be excited for). My dad and brother loved Western movies, and shared a mutual interest in most things involved within the Western genre. When my brother was about 17, they started the tradition of going out and backpacking together. My brother absolutely loved it.

He truly was a remarkable man. Sure, he was hard on my brother and I when it came to school, and I was against that during highschool, before I knew any better. Because, of course, he just wanted the best for my brother and I. He knew we were smart and that we had unlimited potential to not only be successful, but chase a career we actually ENJOYED. He wanted us to follow a different path, because he himself didn’t take school seriously when he was a kid. And he made up for it. In fact, he made up for it while raising me in my toddler years. According to my mother, while the both of them worked, my dad would study for his college classes while simultaneously bathing/feeding/playing with me. He did this while serving time in the Air Force Guard and working two part-time jobs.
He became the lead accountant of International Harvester (more commonly known as just ‘International’ now) in my city’s branch. My dad was phenomenal with numbers, and could whip up a substantial budget in a matter of seconds. He used this talent to eventually help my mom when the two of them tirelessly toiled to buy and old house and convert it into a family-owned salon/spa.

There are a lot of past-tense terms here because my father passed away on January 2nd, 5:00 AM. He collapsed on the stairs at 11:30 PM, January 1st, and retained most of his consciousness, talking to my mom as the EMTs carried him out on a stretcher. They did everything they could for him at the hospital, but COVID-19 tore his lungs up really badly. I guess badly enough to kill him within a 6 hour timespan. He died with his rosary in his right hand and my mother’s hand in his left. He was wearing a brown scapular. The Roman Missal he took to Mass every single Sunday, the one where he had baby pictures of my brother and I as a means of marking the daily readings, was on the hospital couch in the room.

The Latin Mass our priest celebrated for my dad was the most beautiful thing I have experienced to date, and the sheer amount of people that attended my father’s funeral was staggering. Friends of mine, friends of the family, distant relatives from different parts of the country- my dad was loved by so many people, probably close to as intensely as he loved his God, his wife, and his children.

He would have been 52 today. As I am writing this, my mother, brother, and I are driving down to Florida to spend a week with our aunt, my dad’s oldest sister.

I ask that anybody who happens to see this post pray for the repose of my father’s soul. He was so devout, he prayed the rosary daily. He prayed the Angelus, he raised my brother to be such a good religious leader in his wake. He has read the Bible front to back multiple times, he soaked up many different religious texts, old and modern, like a sponge. Even now that he’s gone, his influence remains. Friends and family that weren’t religious before have started attending the Novus Ordo mass, people ask how they can begin their religious journey.
Yet my dad was convinced he had sins to answer for. He told me many times that there were things he did that he wasn’t proud of, and that if heaven would be his eternal reward, he wouldn’t be getting there without a while spent in purgatory.

So I’m asking you to pray for his soul, wherever it may be now. Purgatory or heaven. Pray for my father, please. Like he is still spiritually providing for me, for my mom and brother, I too want to provide for him. Through my own rosary today, through my own prayers.

My father meant the world to me. If I could, I would have given up the world for him. I still would. So I suppose this is my way of doing that, of reaching out to the entire world, asking for prayers.

All I can say is thank you. Thank you, stranger.

Best Bible for someone who is new to Christianity?,CatholicHobbit1,1622894530,"My wife was raised in a different religion and is open to exploring the faith (I only came to the Church recently).  

I’m concerned that if I give her the Didache or Ignatius study bibles that the walls of text will be overwhelming and feel like homework. I basically need an evangelistic tool

I’m looking for a Bible that breaks up the text with articles, maps, illustrations, etc. and has maybe some different colors to make it more visually appealing and pleasant to read than 20 straight pages of scripture in black text

I had 2 initial thoughts:

1.) Word on Fire Gospels - the Gospels are a better place to start that throwing someone into genealogies/OT laws; it has beautiful art and breaks up the text with good formatting and mini articles. The artwork, high quality craftsmanship, gold edges, etc. may help employ beauty as a means to bring her into the faith. I’m really thinking about getting this with her and then maybe the Great Adventure after

How to listen to God,BeautifulGenius10,1622878072,"A parish priest (who is now a vicar general and ignoring me) once lectured people to not just pray to God but to listen to God when praying, and gave the analogy that a patient should not just leave after telling a doctor his problems but should listen to the doctor before leaving. But since then I'd try to listen to God when praying and confuse my own thoughts/imaginations with what God may be trying to tell me. St. Teresa of Avila talked about how to distinguish one's own thoughts from God's words and by her criteria I think almost all or all of the time it was just my thoughts. I felt that the criteria that she described were quite clear (although by that criteria I feel that God almost never or never talked to me). But since hearing what that parish priest said, I could not unhear it although I sort of wanted to, and even when I look at statues of Jesus and Mary, I'd sometimes imagine they may be trying to tell me things when they're my own thoughts/imaginations. So how do I listen to God? Was the priest wrong to tell people to listen to God when praying? How do I listen to God if I feel that God is not talking to me, and if I get myself to think that God is talking or trying to talk to me, I end up confusing my own thoughts with whatever God may be thinking? I told the priest that and he told me to read the bible. So I tried reading the bible but I still didn't get clear answers from God many times.",Catholicism
A Verse To Live By:,Augustine0fHippo,1622877344,"Matthew 6:34 NASB “So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.""

My life changed when I learned about this verse. It is human nature to worry about the future and have plans for every step you take, however, what can we plan for, if not everything, when we are so ignorant of the future? You can make thousands of heavily detailed plans for everything but it all can be foiled in one second by a new development in your life.

""Trust in God and his plans for you"", that is what this verse means to me; ""trust in Him and stay focus on everything going on in the present for that is when He communicates His will"". If you apply this mindset to every day of your life in the past, you will start to see a particular direction that your life has been steered in which puts you where you are now: through the good things and the bad things, each with its own value. 

You might be in a good place right now and that is something to thank Him about, but if you are in a bad place, consider what God might wants to communicate to you or to teach you. We have all been in a bad place once, if you survived then you learned something unique that someone else might not have known about. 

You can only plan as far as your experience allows, you can only gain experience if you fail, and you can only fail if you didn't plan for tomorrow—tomorrow only God knows. He knows what you can handle and what you can't, He knows what you can do and what you can't, He knows the weaknesses that you don't see or don't want to see. You just have to trust him.",Catholicism

Feeling....abandoned? Let down? by the Church over its teaching on Vocations.,Crimson_Eyes,1622873064,"I don't really know where to begin. When I joined the Church, I expected (dangerous, I know) it to help me grow into one of the four vocations. After all, it teaches that everyone is called to one of them, and that our vocation is a direct call from God meant to be the road to our holiness.  


But in the three years since my baptism, I just...haven't seen it. My priest is a lovely father who means well, but the moment my RCIA classes were done, things just...dropped off. Some of that is due to Covid, and some of that is due to me, and some if it is simply due to him being busy.  


This isn't meant as a complaint against him as a person or a priest. If I ever have a spiritual problem, he's happy to talk with me about it...but it's just that, talk. I feel better in the moment, things seem to make a little bit of sense, but there's no....instruction? No growth? It's a lot of 'be patient and trust' and the like, which I recognize is all good advice, but it doesn't get at the heart of the matter.  


I'm getting older. I'm almost thirty. I've spoken with both him and the diocesan vocational director about the priesthood, and was shut down firmly on that front. The religious life faces a lot of the same obstacles which led to me being shut down on the priesthood front.  


I've been trying for marriage basically non-stop, but between the number of logistical impediments and the simple fact that it takes two people discerning correctly means that, regardless of my own discernment process, it isn't really on the cards. Even if I woke up tomorrow, absolutely certain that it was my vocation to be a father, and my priest (after careful counsel) agreed with me...I'm still only 50% of the equation, and unable to just act on the vocation (any more than I already am, at any rate).  


Which leaves the single life. The most vague, underwhelming, non-descript vocation. The catch-all participation trophy. And honestly? I'd be fine with that in theory (I like a lot of the things about my life as it is right now! God has given me a good life!)   


But I have no idea how to live it properly. I'm getting nowhere with it. There's no instruction. I wake up every day with no idea what I'm supposed to do for God.  


And sure, that's true to an extent for all vocations: Every day brings its own challenges. But the priest has a very clear set of priorities in general: Say the Mass at the appointed times, hear confession at the appointed times, pray the Office at the appointed times. When people reach out for pastoral advice, schedule a time and meet with them.  


Obviously, they do a million other things too, especially in parishes without much lay-assistance, but they have a checklist and almost a decade of formal formation to prepare them for that life.  


Parents face more unique challenges, but the basic premise is the same, especially in the early years: Keep the child alive, don't abuse it, put bread on the table. You have to learn on the go, of course, but the priorities are very straightforward and there are all sorts of resources on how to parent as a Catholic, both from lay-people and the clergy. (Not to mention doctors of all sorts for the more mundane element.)  


Monks, I think, speak for themselves on this matter, especially the cloistered. Regimented lives with variance, but with the education and guides in how to live that life.  


Now, are there books by the laity or the spiritual fathers on how to live the fourth vocation? Sure, I'm sure they're out there. But that's not the same as personal spiritual guidance from someone trained for exactly that.   


I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing on a day to day basis, nevermind long term. It is hard for me to pin down exactly what I mean, but it comes back to there being no rules and no guidance. No structure. Yes, pray the Rosary every day (or as much of it as one can). Yes, try to tend to the basics of your body and mind. Yes, stay away from sin.  


But there are a million other decisions to be made each day for which there is no guideline or structure. No clear hierarchy of priorities.    


I feel like the Church has hung me out to dry. It tells me that I need to come to Mass and to tend to the needs of the Church and-  


Let me be clear: The Mass is of infinite value. God is our goal, not our personal gratification. Our relationship with the Church isn't transactional.  


But it sure feels like it is when the same things are expected of me as are expected of lay-families, but I have significantly less support. No matter how much I reach out, I feel like an island in my community, not a part of it. I feel like the Church has no answer to the problem of 'People who don't seem to have a vocation' and just shrugs and expects us to figure it out on our own.  


I don't feel loved or noticed by the Church. I feel like I'm having to sort out my relationship with God on my own, like I was when I was non-denom.",Catholicism

A debate over the Sabbath,Guilty_Interview_757,1622849640,"So me and my agnostic friend had a heated discussion recently involving the Sabbath (Sunday). The context in which the Sabbath was being discussed was that I told an employer in a job interview that I would be unable to work on Sundays as God forbids it. 

However, my friend believes that the Catholic customs such as the Sabbath, should not be so heavily followed if I wanted to get a part time summer job. He also went to state ""its not as if your Muslim, then employers would allow people to take days of Sabbath off"".

This in particular has me wondering that in Western countries, religious Christian's beliefs are slowly but surely being disregarded, however other religion's customs are not.

Indulgences...lemme see if I got this right.,Epicinium,1622848313,"So, I’m a newly converted (this year) Catholic. I’m absolutely loving my faith and it has opened my eyes in a way like never before. In my attempt to live a more God-focused life, I have been doing things like praying the Rosary, reading the Bible (it’s a comic book Bible, but it’s helping me understand the Good Book like never before), and participating in the Sacraments pretty regularly. 

During another one of my questions, someone mentioned indulgences attached to the Rosary. I hadn’t really thought about that before, and being from a Protestant background, it never really occurred to me. So I decided to do some research. 

It would seem that some of the acts I was doing (ex. Reading the Bible, praying the Rosary, making the Sign of the Cross, ect) was granting me a partial indulgence, but apparently you must be aware that the action you are doing will grant an indulgence. Since I was unaware, but am now, I reckon I’ll be granted a partial indulgence for these actions. 

Now, onto plenary indulgences. From my understanding, in addition to an act such as reading the Bible for at least 30 minutes, or praying the Rosary in a church uninterrupted, and being in a state of grace, four other conditions must be met:
 -have an interior disposition for the complete detachment of sin
-make a good confession (within about 20 days of the time of the plenary indulgence
-receive Holy Communion
-say a prayer for The Pope. 

Since I don’t attend weekday Mass due to a hectic life and work schedule, but go on Sundays, is it safe to assume that I will be granted a plenary indulgence on a Sunday if I do, say, read the Bible or Pray the Rosary in church before Mass?

 June 4th is the anniversary of the martyrdom of Quirinus, Bishop of Siscia, during the Great Persecution of the early 4th century AD. Though he was bishop of the Roman town of Siscia (modern-day Sisak in Croatia) in the province of Pannonia, he was taken to the provincial capital of Sabaria (modern-day Szombathely in Hungary) for trial and execution. Thus, he is especially venerated in both Croatia and Hungary though his remains have found their way to Rome over the centuries.

Confusion with school teachings?,LunitaSky,1622842540,"it’s a really stupid question but not gonna close the door of curiosity 
Soooo
7th grade catholic art kid here
I’ve been thinking lately- 
On my school probs at 4th-5th grade (never been to a religious school sadly, only went to a religious school when I was a baby). I would love to study in one tho. 
So teachers there were like 50% religious and the another % non religious.
And my teacher was talking about evolution, “m o n k e” and now that i think on it, it confuses me even more, cause Adam and Eve were the ones that were created First by God on the seventh day, but if the “monke evolution era” is real, in what part of the timeline would it be? Before Adam and Eve? After? W- 
Context please-

And I’m not saying I don’t believe in the biblical stories, but in the first place, where did the “monke evolution” came out from? Some bored dude? Or an investigation that got probably misunderstood?

Pope Francis is Impressive,DeSales1999,1622841246,"I am the last one to say that Papa is perfect, and I have a myriad of criticisms I could sling at the Holy Father, ranging from China to Germany.

For one, Pope Francis is a great legislator, and has approved and promoted so many good canonical processes and laws that I think that may be his ultimate legacy. A second thing, he is legitimately cleaning up the financial scandals of the Church, little by little. A third thing, he is constantly referring to the reality of demons and the demonic, and their place in the promotion of homosexuality and gender ideology. All three of these things I think are overlooked by critics and seriously important, and will be part of his no doubt complicated legacy.

Why on earth do we need to abrogate Summorum Pontificum?,ProLifeCatholic1535,1622840354,"Why? This seems insanely imprudent to me. Why is the Pope even thinking about getting rid of this? I say this as someone who has never been to a TLM in my life and prefers to hear my Mass in English, and prefers the Priest Ad Populum. Why are they clamping down on a Mass that some love so much and young families are increasingly embracing?

Why is this the priority? We have Priests in Germany openly defying the Vatican, Priests with large followings on Twitter flouting the line of heresy, a German ""Synodal Path"" led by Bishops who don't believe what the Church teaches, Protestants and civilly divorced and ""remarried people"" who openly admit they won't stay celibate receiving communion. A huge group of American nuns who often promote heretical ideas launched a media smear campaign against the Vatican, hinting that the Vatican is ""sexist"", and they got off scot-free. And yet, the people who get punished are... the *TLM Worshippers?* Why are we limiting the celebration of the traditional mass? It just doesn't make sense! The Church is in crisis and this community seems like one of the most devout group of Catholics which is rapidly growing. Why slow it down?

I've heard these answers: ""Existing communities will still be allowed to celebrate the TLM"" ""Priests will still be able to celebrate TLM with permission of the Bishop"" or ""These are just rumors, don't trust the media."" I don't think any of them address my question. I know that this won't completely outlaw the TLM, but why is there the need to curb the celebration of it at all? I also know these are just ""rumors"" and the media is not always trustworthy, but this has been reported on by multiple sources, including credible ones. I don't think all of these people are lying. I think you'd have to be awfully naive at this point to believe that this isn't seriously being considered. And yes I know that the source says that the Pope has gone through a third revision to make sure it's not too ""punitive"", but my question is: Why does this document need to exist at all?

The state of our Church right now honestly makes me want to weep. Why, when so many openly defy the Church's teachings, is the Pope looking to crack down on a truly devout, blossoming community that loves their faith. This seems like the epitome of imprudence.",Catholicism

Is Confession Necessary? This is messing with me!,G-EZ-KLAP,1622838057,"I'm a Catholic, I go to confession, I don't necessarily believe that's how forgiveness is given, as the translation is more along the lines of release from sins.

I confess to God and the priest, and pray penance, I don't want to go to hell, so I do both. I've also given smaller time frames for sin and smaller amounts. Which is another reason It's hard to like confession, when someone else is judging you, and in my case, I'm close with the guys!

I'll paraphrase a quote I like; Don't judge your fellow man, as you yourself aren't judged by your Heavenly Father until the end of you days.

Don't get me wrong, It's good to be kept accountable, but it's not necessary to get forgiveness/release from an ordained priest. Or else only Catholics would go to Heaven.

I'm convinced Jesus Christ being crucified forgives all sins, and following the commandments, which are essentially:

Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.

You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

Maybe y'all could chew some holes in this article and change my mind?

Should I put that I'm Catholic in my social media bios?,MoriKei,1622836265,"Kind of a dumb question but I have noticed having 'Catholic' in my social media bios makes people either avoid me or treat me differently than if I don't have it in my profile. I am a pretty non-traditional Catholic (I believe everything the Church teaches, but I'm a goth which sometimes leds to me feeling like an outcast among other Catholics in my parish and online) and I feel like the connotation of being a Catholic on social media makes people think the worst. I'm very much a Catholic social teaching enthusiast and I am not anti-vaxx... but a lot of non-Catholics tend to assume I am a super conservative Republican Catholic, which I am most assuredly not. 

It's kinda rough. Non-Catholics that would otherwise be my friend reject me when they see the Catholic label and a vast majority of Catholics judge my appearance and interests and reject me. I feel like I don't belong anywhere. :(

Knowing God is an act of faith and free will,forevergeeks,1622829510,"For more than 20 years I denied the existence of God because I couldn't find any tangible ""proof"" that God existed.

I searched and searched and the more I searched the more I became convinced that God didn't exist. It is all a made up story I thought, religion is the biggest scam of the human race.

But the more I searched the more emptied I became, the more unstable I felt. 

I had become a breathing robot. 

Why was I unable to feel empathy and compassion for other people?

Why despite having the love of my wife and my son,I still felt unloved and restless?

Then it dawned on me that to know God it takes an act of free will, because love is an act of free will and God is love. 

So to know God, you need to ""choose"" to believe in him. This is what is called ""faith"" 

despite all uncertainties, despite all doubts, you choose to believe in God, because in your heart you know he is there, you can't just express it with words. 

When you look for proof of God, you want to set the conditions in the relationship between you and God, and God is sovereign, the conditions are set by him, not you! ",Catholicism

Possible demon? Advice needed.,Shiningstar2002,1622820835,"I would really appreciate if you would read this and perhaps give me some gudiance on what this could be, At the age of 13 I woke up to find someone licking my neck, I could feel it as if someone was really there,physically doing it. Then I began seeing Shadow like figures in the form of a person without any features visible, which would just be there in my room and watch me. After this nothing happened until I was 16. 

I started to experience sleep paralysis. I also want to mention that all my relationships in the past failed. So in the sleep paralysis I experienced this invisible entity speaking to me saying 'ill be gentle' and then started touching my breasts and licking my neck again. I never experienced sleep paralysis before. This sleep paralysis lasted for about a year I would thankfully be able to snap out of it before anything further happened

. In my dreams which were very vivid I saw this man who appeared very angry with me for some reason, he was very abusive towards me, but with time started touching me in intimate ways, kissing me, hugging, etc. In one dream that was very vivid I felt someone having sex with me holding me tighlty and I heard the Words 'smothering love' at the time I didnt know what even smothering was Im sure Ive never heard of it until I looked it up. Afterwards I began to experience voices. They were very nice to me at first. 


They were very friendly to me and wanted to be friends with me one even said they fancied me. Then they changed their behaviour with time and threatened me to stay awake or else they would rape me and I believed this(I stayed awake for 2 night after which I was exhausted). After I realised that they werent anything friendly and thought these were demons,(they also appeared to read my thoughts) they started to threaten me that they would kill me and from nowhere I had these extreme pains all over my body, in my chest area I had a burning sensation and felt a needle like pain that felt as if something was ripping me aparat or cutting me in half(I couldnt help but cry as the pain was so intense).



 Then I stopped feeling my emotions until now I hadnt been able to feel anything. I also had a pain in my eyes the voices were threatning me that I would go blind, my eyes started to smudge and I could hardly see anything, I also had a horrible pain in my spine. (these pains came from nowhere unexpectedly). One day I was sitting at the table and studying for my exams as Im now 18 years old. When from nowhere again I felt a horrible pressure in my head as if something heavy was on top of my head, and a squezzing type of pain in my head and from that day on I wasnt able to study anymore my memory went from being good to being hardly able to remember anything and I couldnt understand what the textbook was saying as I tried to read it again and again. 


Before the head pain, I never experienced such a pain in my head, before I could understand everything in the textbook. My intelligence got so much worse I couldnt understand what people were saying to me. (everything happened after those pains in my head). I also lost the ability to feel like myself I feel as if my character changed for no reason, I lost the ability to feel my confidence, my will and strength is weak whilst compared to before this isnt like me as I was a very strong person. I also lost the ability to talk about different topics except this topic, I was a very chatty person before and now I can barely manage a few words on other topics except this one,(I can barely chat with my family members, I only say okay, yes or no, but on this topic I speak on how I normaly used to). I also had a thorn like feeling in my chest that felt as if someone was freezing me from the inside.

 Also last thing I felt as if someone was having sexual intercouse with me whilst I was awake and when I woke up from my sleep I felt someone sucking on my breasts.My questions are, what type of being is this? why would it cause all of this, what is its intention and what does it want from me. It also appears to watch me all the time. Its been 5 years with me now.


I also know its not medical as Ive been to psychiatrists and they gave me various medications in the period of 2 years and none of them had any effect. So the doctors decided to stop giving me the medication. Nothing changed. 

The voices also appear to know whats written in books films that I never read or heard before Word for Word, they are very accurate.

I Went to confession and I heard screaming and shrieking and also my feelings came back for a couple of minutes but then they were gone again.

Ive also been to priests and they did 4 times delivernace prayers on me but non worked, any advice welcome i really need to get rid of this as its ruining my life for already 2 years and Im just stuck in one place and cant even go to university or live normaly

Girlfriend Is Having A Hard Time Believing,AceGymRat,1622819504,"Hello all, I’ve been with my girlfriend for over a year and during that time up until recently she told me she was an avid believer. Recently she’s been having really bad mental health issues and she can’t see a therapist right now so she’s kind of spiralling. I’ve been doing my best to help her by distracting her with movies and not minding if she spends all day playing video games to take her mind off of things. However last night she told me she wasn’t as religious as she was when we first met. I was confused since I had only looked into joining the church after a decade of not believing because of her (I ended up joining for me, she just lead me to it). 

She told me “I after all the bad stuff that’s happened, I don’t think he’s there” and I asked if she was going to leave Catholicism and she told me she couldn’t since she was already confirmed into the church. I assume she means the issues within the world today like hate crimes or the Israel - Palestine conflict, as well as her deteriorating mental health.

I’ve never been a pushy person when it comes to religion because I know when I didn’t believe, people pushing religion on me only made me stray further away. I don’t want to push her further away, and I’ve mentioned how reading the Bible or completing challenges from the Bible app has helped me feel better and happier, but she doesn’t seem to take away anything from that.

Do you guys have any advice? Is there anything I can do for her? I always pray for her when I attend church, pray that her depression doesn’t suffocate her anymore. I know coming back to God has helped my own depression significantly but I feel like maybe she doesn’t want to change, anything I suggest she doesn’t really want to do. This is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with, any help is much appreciated.

The Four Fundamental Responses to Vatican II,LucretiusOfDreams,1622814824,"**Liberal:** the liberal statements of Vatican II themselves should be interpreted to mean that some views that might have previously been consider incompatible with the Catholic faith, are now so, and so some views that might have previously been considered compatible with the Catholic faith, are now not. After all, some views might have made sense in an earlier context, but are now obsolete in today age and context, or some views now can be seen as not part of the deposit of faith, because our understanding wasn’t full developed enough for us to see how these views weren’t actually compatible with the deposit of faith in the end (specifically with regards to human dignity). The intentions of the majority of the council fathers seems to be in line with the will of the Holy Spirit.

**Sedevacantist:** the liberal statements of Vatican II themselves should be interpreted to mean that some views that might have previously been consider incompatible with the Catholic faith, are now so, and so some views that might have previously been considered compatible with the Catholic faith, are now not, and therefore the council taught error and must be rejected. The Catholic faith simply does not change, despite changes in contexts and culture. In fact, the previous eras of Western civilization were more compatible with Church teaching, so we should be even more skeptical of any novelties in contemporary society, and stick just with what our Fathers have left us. Even *if* we can in theory force a compatible teaching onto the statements, the *intention* behind the authors seems to be the heretical interpretations, and the vagueness just serves as a smokescreen to the devout in order to hide that the council has and is doing exactly what maybe even the majority of the council fathers wanted it to do.

**Conservative:** the liberal statements of Vatican II themselves are vague enough to be interpreted in ways both compatible with and incompatible with previous Church teachings, so therefore we should interpret them in light of earlier teachings, like those of Popes Pius and Leo. We should understand that the council is not actually contradicting previous Church teaching, but helping us bring it forth in a way more intuitive to modern people. In fact, some of the council’s liberal statements might serve to shine greater understanding on the previous teachings, maybe even help better overcome deficiencies in their wording and emphasis in the past. The vagueness is unfortunate, although it might be well intentioned by the majority of the council fathers who simply did not understand the unintended consequences that would result.

**Traditionalist:** the liberal statements of Vatican II themselves are vague enough to be interpreted both in ways compatible with previous teaching and incompatible with previous teaching. Therefore, although the council didn’t saying anything technically in error, we would be better off ignoring the council because it worded certain statements vaguely enough that in practice it allowed for and allows for the rationalization of these novel heretical teachings. The interpretations of them that modern people tend to tend to be more heretical than not, and so we should just cut our losses, and stick with what we had before Vatican II and go from there. The vagueness is unfortunate, although it might have been well intentioned by some and maybe event the majority of the council fathers who did not understand the unintended consequences that would result, but a sizable and influential minority of others seemed to know that what ended up happening when the council was put into practice was exactly what they intended.

Most of the devout are somewhere between the conservative and traditionalist responses, while the majority of the clergy seem to be between the liberal and conservative responses. No one likes the sedevacantist response, including the sedevacantists. 

I’m personally someone in between the conservative and traditionalist camps, although I more and more find myself sympathetic with what I’m calling the traditionalist camp, just in case my bias is important, although I tried to be fair to all these positions, especially since there are some views I might be considered “liberal” on, like the death penalty. I will say too that I’m the least sympathetic with what I’m calling the sedevacantist position, although I understand why they think that way.",Catholicism
Why do so many Catholics support abortion?,AeriePuzzled6224,1622814283,"I could see debates about rare situations like if a mother's life is in danger, but most abortion is not that.  Even when I was an atheist, logically it made sense that abortion was murdering a baby, it has a detrimental affect on the mother's mental health, and affects how our society views children and the family.

I can understand debates on other issues.  There are some things in the Catholic church I don't agree with, but it's disturbing and depression to me how people have a laid back attitude about murdering a baby.

Why I came back,Present_Living7990,1622810322,"I was a convert to the Catholic Church at age 19.  This was the time of guitar masses, really bad liturgy.  The truly awful stuff - polka masses, clown masses, you name it.  But, it was all pretty good, until I discovered that there were “Eastern Rites,” and the beauty of liturgy.  I began to seriously explore the Great Schism and the history leading up to it, and the claims of the Eastern Orthodox.  When I attended the liturgy in the Eastern churches (Catholic or Orthodox) I discovered the beauty that had been lost from the Latin rite church.  Didn’t take much time for me to decide to become Orthodox.  I had heard about the issue of ethnocentrism, but ignored it.  Life went on pretty much with normal ups and downs.  My illusions were shattered when I saw as much scandal in the OC as I saw in the RCC, but I stayed anyway. 

And then, after a few decades, something changed.  I divorced my first wife (not a Christian - very long story) and moved 2,000 km away to a new city.  Married an Orthodox woman (in the OC) who had no problem attending a Catholic Church when she travelled.  She insisted I try to get an annulment from Rome.  I agreed, and went through the process.  It was invaluable to see that the first “marriage” wasn’t one at all.  My wife’s position was that Rome was to be respected and honored, and that when Rome spoke the matter was over.  Fast forward three years - the annulment was granted, and then a few months later Moscow and Constantinople excommunicated each other (again).  The issue was not doctrinal, but one of authority and jurisdiction.  It became clear that thing that the EO churches lack is unity.  They don’t have Peter.  

At that point, I threw my proverbial hands in the air and (with my wife’s blessing) returned to confession and communion in the Catholic Church.  All told, I was out for about 30 years.  

It was a wild ride.  I’m pretty stubborn and hardheaded, but I’m glad to have swum the Tiber again.  I’ll always love the EO Church - my wife is EO and won’t consider formally joining the RCC.  It’s her family and cultural heritage and I respect that.  It just took me a very long time to come around to what the RCC has been saying all along - continuity and authority are critical to preserving Christian unity.

God gave me the grace of making a good confession. Glory to God!,kikiki32,1622803749,"Hi. I posted here this week, asking how to get grace to overcome sin in my life. I was slightly angry at God, since I saw how great sinners converted, and I wasn't progressing anywhere in my spiritual life. 

I received some very good responses, but there was one person (u/Dr_Talon) who asked me if there were any other areas in my life where I could be blocking the graces of God. That question got me thinking.

So I asked God about it, and over the next two days, I started remembering past sins in a very slow way. I saw in a very clear way how 3 or 4 sins had driven my whole life, and I recalled some unconfessed sins, and some unconfessed aspects of some sins that were specially ugly to God. Each sin I remembered started to weigh in my soul. It's like if God had removed a veil from the ""eyes of my soul"". I had been blind, but I was seeing things very clearly.

I finally gathered the courage to go to confession (which was not easy), and I ended up making a summarized life confession that included all of those ugly sins I had almost forgotten and had not confessed yet. I feel way better now, and I hope I truly have a clean soul now.

So let me say thank you to u/Dr_Talon for putting me on the right track with that reply.

I like having a lot so I don't have to go back to the church to get some ever so often. I am disabled and my mother doesn't want me walking back and forth to church each time for holy water. The road to the church has no sidewalk and a car almost ran me over, hence why my mother is scared of me walking along. I only take a small glass bottle with me each Sunday and that's usually not enough to last me through the week. I usually make the sign of the cross with it each time I pray.

The reason of impetration on the part of God is His sanctity, on account of which we ask to be heard \[.....\] The reason for impetration on the part of the person who asks is ""thanksgiving""; since ""through giving thanks for benefits received we merit to receive yet greater benefits,"" (ST II-II, Q.83, A17)

Stop anxiety before confession,Kurumi-Nakano,1622783241,"Hi all,

Everytime I go to confession, I get super anxious while in line and in the confessional. I'm in panic mode the whole way through; I can't concentrate on praying or examining my conscious because I'm too anxious about it.

Of course, getting done with it is a relief, and I'm able to relax a bit, but I still know that I have to go again in a few weeks, which gets me anxious again.

This has been the case ever since I was old enough to make a confession, and because of this, I've always hated it and tried my best to avoid it, at times going months without it because I can't take the anxiety. I've even just left the confession line altogether because I couldn't take the anxiety.

I know this isn't a good thing to do, but I just can't help it. I thought about going more frequently to get more exposed to it, but that hasn't worked either.

I've tried to find answers online, but none of them have worked. I go to an anonymous confessional (screened) and I realize that the priest does not judge and he's heard it all before, but that doesn't make it any easier for me. It's not the circumstances of the confession, it's the actual act that I get anxious over.

It really is remarkable to witness long-term problems finally being dealt with at my home parish,ICannotHelpButWonder,1622780864,"When I moved back to my hometown in the jubilee year of 2000, I began attending my ancestral parish once more as there is little choice here locally. I had not attended it since 1975 and I was stunned to witness what I did, in terms of the liturgy and the parish office.

In sum, over time, the operation of the parish office had been taken over by a cabal of both paid and volunteer laypersons with very little supervision. More than 90% were female. Caustic, difficult people who were tolerated because *they ran things!* This gave the various pastors more time to drink, smoke and be hungover, before finally heading off to rehab and another assignment. The manner in which they treated people -- particularly older people trying to arrange funerals, was truly abominable.

The same was true for mostly volunteer ""liturgy "" cabal (many held dual membership with the parish office cabal.) Again, highly sexist -- more than 90% female. Once more they were tolerated because they did much of the pastor's work. Turf-protecting, arrogant, ignorant and miserable people. They probably took a bigger overall toll on the parish than the other cabal.

Members from both cabals would fight with anyone and everyone - most particularly among themselves. The damage they did to my parish was truly grim. In both cases I believe it was a matter of slowly conditioning the faithful to accept all the crap (e.g. dropping a frog into lukewarm water and slowly turning up the heat, vs. dropping one in hot water.) Still, huge numbers of people left my parish during that \~25 year period. 

Complain to one of the pastors (no matter how reasonable and well documented)? They didn't want to hear it! There were drugs and alcohol to consume, and hangovers to nurse!

Not long before the pandemic, we received yet another pastor. He's by no means a strong leader, a nice guy or a serious intellect. He's father coarse actually. He does however bring experience, he's not a drunk, and he does have some level of courage to deal with difficult personnel issues.

The first truly notable thing he did was move the parish's tabernacle back to its rightful place in the rear center of the sanctuary from the side niche in an added-on annex to my parish. A LONGTIME fight! The resistance and hate he encountered from both cabals was serious, but he did it. A HUGE symbolic win. He's done a few other ""clean up"" projects like this.

Next, under cover of the pandemic, he simply dismantled both cabals. Gone. Bye-bye. STUNNING! When he did have to bring in additional employees or volunteers, none came from the ranks of either cabal.

keeping secrets from parents,usernameuserename,1622776296," I am a teenager (so still under my parents authority) and I’m kind of confused on how far I have to go to obey them in everything. My parents told me not to keep secrets from them, but how far do I have to take this? Would it be gravely sinful for me to hide small things from them? (like who I was spending time with, what was I doing on my phone, etc) Recently I had been hanging out with someone I thought my parents wouldn’t approve of so I didn’t tell them.

Transgenders: Should Catholics respect their identification or not?,Leading-Reporter-848,1622773740,"WHO officially classified transgerderism is not a mental disorder. and the world is more and more accepting transgenderism, saying genders are decided by each one's identification, not by biology.

Many transgenders say things like ""I am biologically a man, but actually I am a woman"". It seems like the term 'gender' is being redefined, apart from biology.

Even when I don't count my religious view, it simply does not make sense to me. I mean... how can you change your gender by idenfitication? If they can do it, what if someone says ""I am biologically 32 years old Asian man but actually I am 3 years old Black woman""? 

How do you think about it? Should we respect their identification and regard it as something real just as modern society is slowly accepting, or should we say it is wrong and this trend should stop? if so,  why?

Question regarding NFP,bittnerator,1622763581,"So I've spent a lot of time looking into NFP and understanding it more so as to better articulate its merits to people who aren't aware of it.

However, my question is why is the act still considered ""open to life"" if the chances of conception are practically zero. For example, if a couple has sex when the woman is menstruating, wouldn't the act be considered ""closed to life?""

I think back to Adam and Eve, specifically the idea that Satan tempted and brought original sin to the world in the form of a snake. 

Is it in any way unholy or in opposition to God to possess a mouse with such imagery on it? I don’t believe that Razer intends to make a reference to Satan, but the serpents are apparent nevertheless.

Need your advice,LoveByCandlelight,1622756421,"I have a tendency to focus intensely on what will happen during my particular judgment after I die. I spend my life now in a state of unknown. I don’t know whether I mortally sin and I don’t know the state of my soul. This is because the alternative is painful - scrupulously writing down every single little thing I have done wrong. It becomes a long list, and it makes me feel worse. So I often do things in spite of the doubt, as a way to try to live a happier life and combat OCD. Unfortunately the drawback to that is the doubt and uncertainty. 

During times of distress and despair and sadness, I’m prone to having thoughts where I want to die because I want to find out the answer already so I hopefully no longer have to worry about it. Or if I would finally know instead of being in an unknown state. 


But even when I’m not really sad or despairing, when I’m just maybe only kinda sad and anxious like right now, I still have thoughts where I feel the desire to die. It’s not that I want to die. It’s not that I’m suicidal. It’s that I am living in this state of unknown and the alternative is being so scrupulous that it leads to exhaustion and despair. Not to mention it makes it harder to love God. 

The feeling of wanting to be in heaven or even in purgatory is because my fear of hell makes it hard to live peacefully on earth. But I cannot love God perfectly if I’m afraid. 

I enjoy reading near death experiences because then I feel like I’m more able to gauge what might happen to me, but I had a thought that it might not be very healthy for me to do that. But at the same time, reading them does help give me some information and advice. 

Should I just surrender this and leave this to God? Do you feel reading a book on near death experiences and focusing on this is not good for me? I think so, deep down. 

It’s not even that I truly want to die. I like life and want to do fun and great things in it. It’s just that I feel I want an answer.

"Protestants who acknowledge that the Catholic Church was established by Jesus Christ, but won't convert",theotokosprayforus,1622750242,"Why????

I'm in the process of converting to catholicism, and my protestant grandmother was talking to me to figure out why I was converting. She was a devout catholic (in a very catholic country) who was unfortunately swept away by American evangelical missionaries. She told me she would never go back to the catholic church. When she asked me why I was converting, I told her ""it's the Church founded by Jesus Christ"". She responded, ""yes that's true, but the Church became so corrupted since then"". We went through all of her objections (the usual: Mariology, statues, praying to saints, repetitive prayers are ""sinful"", etc.), and I was able to answer her objections pretty well I would say. To me, it sounds like what is really holding her back is preaching. She doesn't like the emphasis on repentance, on uniting our sufferings with Christ, etc in the Catholic Church. She follows prosperity gospel preachers and only likes to hear messages on love and healing and prosperity. By the way, I love my grandma so much. I honestly think she could become a saint if she never left the church. Her life was literally hell and yet she is so full of love, joy, and grace. She's the most loving woman I have ever met in my life.

Now I have another friend who is a neo-calvinist. We have lots of discussions on theology and our faith, and we also poke fun to each other for him being a protestant and me joining the Catholic Church. He is pretty well versed in church history, and he knows that there used to only be One Church, which was the Catholic Church. He even said that he understands that the Eucharist could be the Body and Blood of our Lord! He said he would become catholic, if it weren't for all the legalistic bureaucracy in the Church.

I also have a protestant cousin who said she recognizes that the apostolic churches are the only churches with valid apostolic succession. She prefers orthodoxy to catholicism though, based on some of the research she's done (she likes the mystical aspect of the east). I told her that also exists in eastern catholic churches as well! But she told me recently that she doesn't want to join any of the apostolic churches anymore, because she sees that the Holy Spirit moves in whatever denomination you're in, as long as you build a relationship with Christ.

I'm just surprised that people could acknowledge that the Catholic Church was founded by our Lord, but still not want to join. I've just been praying for my loves ones to come and swim the tiber.",Catholicism

Scarcity of young Catholics,TheKingsPeace,1622746930,"Hello all. 31 year old millennial Catholic here. I thought I’d share sort of a concerning thought.

The more in faith I’ve grown the more I realize that millennial Catholics ones who actually practice the faith are pretty rare entities.

I have pretty much only encountered them at my churches young adult group and rarely to never encounter them in “ the wild” ( everyday life).

I attend a very large well to do suburban parish with a large grade/ middle school.

Not one person whom I went to Catholic high school with goes to these events and nor could I visualize them doing so.

I have some theories for this. Being Catholics is far easier then “ being” Catholic.

Catholicism places a lot of onerous restraints on people, especially sexual ones, such that those people of means, strong social skills etc just aren’t going to be attracted tot the Catholic life. 

Sad to say the great majority of young parishioners who go my church to not attend these events. Sad to say at least 1/3 to 1/2 of the ones who do are out of Towners, socially awkward or both. It’s like part of the draw is Catholicism is their last chance to make friends.

Opinion: Do or don't wear a crucifix? Over or under clothes?,boyhero97,1622745751,"Hi. I just thought I'd create a *friendly* post about opinions when it came to wearing crucifixes. I've always worn crosses and crucifixes off and on in my life, most of the time off because I constantly lose them or they break off.  I recently bought one made of steel and paracord, so I'm hoping this one won't get lost. But this time when I put it on, at the age of 23, I started to think about what wearing a crucifix means. Specifically I was thinking of two bible verses. First, the one about whoever denies me on Earth, I too shall deny in heaven. Second, the bible verse about being careful with how you present your good deeds, because those who overtly do them will receive their reward on Earth, not Heaven. (Obviously I'm paraphrasing here). I'm not saying wearing or not wearing a crucifix are grave enough matters to constitute a sin, those are just the thoughts that came to my head. And I was also thinking about how much of Europe sees religion as something private that shouldn't be openly displayed, and how American culture is in many ways the opposite. So with that over-lengthy introduction: 

 Do you like wearing a crucifix? Does it have personal benefits for you? Do you feel it's a proud display of your religion? Do you think it's unnecessary? If you do wear one, do you like to wear it over or under your shirt? Do you see it as overly prideful? Or do you see it as simply a declaration of your faith?

What do you guys think it means when we say God is love?,Mlg_Rauwill,1622742509,"hello my fellow Catholics,

Recently I've been trying to tie together all of the definitions that we give when we talk about God. Some say God is ipsum esse subsistens, or God is love, or God is the infinite. To me these are the strongest definitions of God that I find out there for a couple of reasons. So I'm really just here to ruminate about them publicly, and get your guys thoughts

First, ipsum esse subsistens. I think this definitely does a good job of synthesizing the Aristotelian notion of God with the Christian God. I also think that this does a good job of explaining why we can use the argument from motion to talk about God as well. Lastly, I also sort of is an umbrella term which also contains God is absolute being. My problems with it is just using this definition and nothing else. For example Heidegger who as many of you know was one of the great philosophical minds of the 20th century, didn't really like this idea of God. Because it just reduces God to pure force or motion, which really has no transcendent aspect to it. Why worship just pure force? 

Second I'm going to talk about both the infinite and love. To me the infinite captures the eternal mystery, God is infinitely beyond our categories and as such cannot be fully captured. I also like infinite because it shows in a non-arbitrary way that God is truly, where all being can trace it's ontological source, because what could be greater than the infinite? Now the problem with this as you probably all know is that this places God so high above us that we have absolutely no way to commune with him. He becomes so abstract, that he might just float off. So that's where love comes in. Love is logos. Which sounds just like a silly arbitrary declaration, but when you understand all of the moving parts that go into that statement I think it may be one of the most profound declarations I've ever heard. For one when we say Love is logos, we are tying together reason and the will. One cannot impose itself on reality, and supersede the other. They both need to work with each other. Which is actually one of the problems I see with Nietzsche and Sartre who certain believe in the duality of the reason and the will. Also when we say logos is love, God is logos, and God is the infinite. What we find is the particular instantiation of the infinite is love, but it's not some how less than the infinite they are equal. Also the fact that logos became incarnate in the world and entered into history, means that logos can in fact be comprehended. This broke the stop gap which had plagued Greek thought for so long. Basically from my understanding many thought that logos was incomprehensible, but with Saint Paul's synthesis, not only is logos comprehensible, but it is also equal to the infinite.

Now that I've synthesized the infinite and love, I need to synthesize all of that with ipsum esse subsistens. So now I'd say the simple act of to be, the ultimate act of to be is love. The definition of love which makes all of this make sense is preserving multiplicity in unity. Which this definition of love was derived by Saint Maximus when working on the Christology. Saint Maximus in my understanding believe Jesus had a divine will and a human will, but they were both united in one person. They weren't mixed together or anything like that, but demonstrate that in the person of Jesus(unity), there are a multiplicity of identities, which don't destroy each other or overpower each other, but instead work in perfect harmony without destroying their particularity. Which means if Christ is logos and logos is love this must be what love is. And we see in our own lives that this definition of love is how the world lays itself out to us. You have a particular identity, which is then joined with a larger identity like a family or a church. That unified identity then scales up to an even larger identity,  in the case of family this could be like a community. Then communities scale up to a county and so on and so forth until you reach the infinite. So the simple act of to be itself, or the way that being is in the world is through love. Because without these identities which scale up there is no such thing as being, and so the world wouldn't exist. Or the world would just be God because God's unity should in theory destroy our particularity because he is the infinite. But that doesn't end up happening. We exist as a particular.

&amp;#x200B;

The part that I'm struggling with is how does Agape fit into Saint Maximus' definition of love? That's where I think I'm missing something because Christianity is so clearly about Agape. Maybe you could say Agape and Saint Maximus' definition of love are one, but I haven't figured that out yet. I need to fit Agape into this somehow.",Catholicism

An Apology from Canadian Catholics (and others abroad),Aforestforthetrees1,1622740808,"As you may have heard, there was a mass grave containing the bodies of 215 children (some as young as 3) found on the site of a residential school in Canada. This school was run by the Catholic Church and only officially recorded around 35 deaths. The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops has expressed sorrow at the discovery, but has issued no apology. While this is likely due to legal liability reasons, every other church in Canada that ran these schools has apologized. 

As a Catholic myself, and knowing the hearts of the other Catholics in my life, my heart breaks for these children and their families. I know the everyday parishioners want an apology issued. So we are issuing one ourselves. Admitting our church’s wrongdoing is not disloyalty, but simply acknowledging the truth and working towards reconciliation. If your conscience guides you to, please sign the following open apology letter and share with your friends and family. Much gratitude.

"Dante's Ascent of Mount Purgatory, Cleansing From Vice - Online discussion on the Divine Comedy",PhilosophyTO,1622736352,"Dante’s Divine Comedy, written in the early 1300s, is ostensibly an epic poem about a pilgrim who travels through Inferno (hell), Purgatorio (purgatory), and Paradiso (heaven) to encounter God face-to-face and then returns to tell us about it. 

More interestingly, it is a poem of learning, philosophy, and the struggles of life with more nuances, depth and perspectives than I would have thought possible had I not read it myself. To say that the Commedia is rich in a multidimensional way is an understatement. The Commedia is intricate, dramatic, thrilling, mind-blowing, cosmic, shocking, ineffable, sometimes oppressive, and altogether extraordinary!

Do non Catholic Christians (Yes Christians, those who have accepted Christ as Savior and have received the Holy Spirit.) Go to Heaven or since they are not Catholics do they go to hell?  


Can someone go to Heaven with out the sacraments? (I have accepted Christ, I have Received the Spirit, but I have never participated in communion)  


How does one pray to some one who isn't God (I've always understood that the Lord being all powerful knows everything and would hear you praying and in turn would hear this prayer) but how does it work? How is this not heresy? (I'm not being hateful I'm genuinely confused.)  


How does confessing to a Priest your sins gain you any forgiveness or is the purpose just to show your repentance?   


I have these questions and am genuinely confused and just want to do what is right by Lord Christ, I love Him with all my heart and want what He wants, I'm scared that if I'm not within the Church that I may not get to Heaven since I'm a Protestant.

An urgent plea to all Catholics engaging in Social Media,Upbeat_Classic,1622729918,"Hello all,

Just  wanted to share a brief thought that could hopefully inspire some soul  searching for all of us. Obviously we live in a day and age of bias,  fake news, misinformation, and division.

As Catholics we are called to at all times be a witness to the truth, good news, and love of God and the Gospel.

We  are also called to avoid all occasions of scandal (the mere appearance  of wrongdoing even if we ourselves are not actually doing anything  immoral but could lead others to believe that we are).

With  those thoughts in mind, I would urge that we as Catholics look at  ourselves as an atheist or nonbeliever would, with regards to our claims  and posts on social media. I've noticed an alarming uptick in otherwise  faithful Catholics sharing false information, libelous memes about  politicians, anti-science content, and conspiracy theories. This is  disturbing to me as we are obligated to be beacons of truth and reliable  witnesses to the Church.

If  someone skeptical of the church sees their Catholic friend posting  ""Masks don't work"", ""Vaccines cause Autism"", and ""The Eucharist is the  Body of Christ"", what opinion are they likely to form regarding the  latter claim? What conclusion are they likely to form of Catholics as a  whole and of the truths of the Church? This is something I think we are  all called to avoid, and I think we as Catholics have the duty to place  our faith above our political leanings, and actively fight against  misinformation on all sides, rather than remaining silent or (even  worse) promoting it ourselves.

I  would even argue that this goes so far as to stop using and promoting  unreliable or pseudo-Catholic conspiratorial sources like LifeSiteNews  or NeedtoKnow.news that make Catholics appear overly-credulous,  un-discerning, and uneducated.

Here is a beautifully written article by Fr. Matthew Schneider in regards to this topic:

[https://www.patheos.com/blogs/throughcatholiclenses/2021/01/catholics-promoting-conspiracy-theories-harms-our-cause/](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/throughcatholiclenses/2021/01/catholics-promoting-conspiracy-theories-harms-our-cause/)

This is not meant to be a post of condemnation or attack, but rather a call  and an urging to examine how our online presence affects our mission to  evangelize and make disciples of all nations.

"Why is Catholic church so keen on keeping same sex marriage both illegal and a sin, despite lack of sufficient biblical foundations?",Either_Helicopter416,1622727291,"Most passages used to condemn homosexual behaviour are usually misunderstood (Romans 1 26-27) or non-applicable (Leviticus 18 22). 

Nevertheless Vatican refuses to reconsider their position which ends up harming a great deal of people (suicide tries 5-8 times more likely when compared to heterosexual peers; ~80% of homosexual teenagers in Catholic Poland are not accepted by their family members). This is what Jesus was talking about in Matthew 7 16-20 when he talked about wolves in sheep clothings and fruits of their teachings. 

How can anyone with compassion look at the statics and the affected people and say it's God's will??? Why are we condemning them to hell with no way to reach salvation despite their faith? And no, God didn't call them all to celibacy, path of celibacy should only be designed for person who wishes and desires it; we're forcing them to do that.

And for the love of God, don't say hating them (by denying inseparable part of them) is ""loving"" them. I could murder 100 people and later claim I did good for them since they met God (greatest good) earlier than they would've. Does that mean it was an act of love?",Catholicism
"The Resilience of the Faith part 2.......... How out of the nihilistic ashes of the French revolution, a humble priest Jean Vianney - The Cure of Ars - became internationally famous looking after the physical and spiritual needs of his parishioners",TJB74,1622726098,"  

* At the early stages of the revolution Church property was confiscated and the state assumed responsibilities such as paying the clergy and caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned. Religious orders and monasteries were dissolved, while monks and nuns were encouraged to return to private life. Clergy were required to swear loyalty to the new Civil Constitution but only 24% complied. 
* The architects of the revolution were attempting to rewrite society, replacing the monarchy with the French First Republic and introduced a new calendar, with 1792 becoming ""Year One"". This was in effect an attempt to de-Christianise France but underestimated the depth of its roots. In October 1793, the Christian calendar was replaced and Festivals of Liberty, Reason, and the Supreme Being were scheduled. New forms of moral religion emerged, including the deistic Cult of the Supreme Being and the atheistic Cult of Reason. By Easter 1794, few of France's forty thousand churches remained open; many had been closed, sold, destroyed, or converted to other uses.
* Finally the revolution had entered its final phase described as the Terror as mob rule was accelerating.  The guillotine was invented and an estimated 17,000 counter revolutionaries were beheaded ( including many of the early revolutionary leaders including the infamous Maximilien Robespierre. Interestingly - victims of revolutionary violence, whether religious or not, were popularly treated as Christian martyrs, and the places where they were killed became pilgrimage destinations.  
* The anticlerical Terror forced many loyal priests to hide from the regime in order to carry out the sacraments in their parish. The Vianneys. travelled to distant farms to attend Masses celebrated by priests on the run. Realizing that such priests risked their lives day by day, a young John began to look upon them as heroes and when Napoleaon re-established the church in 1802 Vianney was able to study for the priesthood
* In a remote rural pariah t he became famous for his work in the confessional and spent 11 to 12 hours daily in Winter reconciling people with God. In the summer months this time was increased to 16 hours and by the time he had been in the parish thirty years, the number of pilgrims from outside had reached 20,000 a year. During the last ten years of his life, he spent 16 to 18 hours a day in the confessional. When he died at the age of 73 and the bishop presided over his funeral with 300 priests and more than 6,000 people in attendance. In 1959, to commemorate the centenary of John Vianney's death, Pope John XXIII issued the encyclical letter *Sacerdotii nostri primordia*. John Paul II visited Ars in person in 1986 and Pope Benedict XVI declared a Year of the Priest in his name
* In November 2018, Vianney's incorrupt heart was transported to the United States for a 6-month nationwide tour. By the end of the tour, ""the relic \[had\] traveled almost 36,000 miles — almost one and a half times the circumference of the Earth — and was available for over 1,200 hours of public veneration and tens of thousands  had visited.

Romanticism and the Nazarenes.,Tamerovv,1622700584,"Romanticism was an epoch that lasted from the end of the 18th century to the 19th century and expressed itself in the fields of fine arts, literature and music, but also in the fields of history, theology and philosophy as well as natural sciences and medicine included. Romanticism broke the boundaries of classicism, the pure intellect and the boundaries between the art forms; the aim was a freely creative imagination. This manifests itself in a “universal poetry” that is science, religion and poetry and lyrical, epic, dramatic and musical at the same time. The romantics had a preference for the dreamlike, wonderful, unconscious, sacred and supernatural, as well as for the Middle Ages, nature and solitude. Well-known romantics were Caspar David Friedrich, ETA Hoffmann, Franz Schubert, Mikhail Lermontov, George Byron, Frédéric Chopin, William Turner, Novalis ...

An important branch of Romanticism is so-called ""Nazarene"" art: this is the name given to a romantic-religious art movement that German-speaking artists founded in Vienna and Rome at the beginning of the 19th century. Representatives of this style, the Nazarenes, were mostly close to Catholicism, and many converted to it. The goal of the Nazarenes was the renewal of art in the spirit of Christianity, using old Italian and German masters as models. They influenced the art of all of Romanticism. To this day, many frescoes in this style can be found in European churches. 

In many ways i very much disagree with Romanticism. But I also love, for example, the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, the music of Schubert or the poems of Novalis. All three were influenced by Christianity, as were the wonderful painters of the nazarene movement.

What do you think? Can Catholicism and Romanticism be reconciled? Do you have any preferences for any artists or works of art, that could fall under this epoch?

Advice Welcomed: How to Give Up the Self and Die To Christ,elmcityslim,1622695112,"After three years of clawing my way back to the Faith, I finally got around to reading the classic, the *almost* required reading of ""Mere Christianity"". For at least the last year I couldn't shake this nagging feeling that I was a fake, a phony, a terrorist amongst saints. Sure, I have learned a lot about our faith - enough to even dole out some halfway decent advice on here and I even tried my hands at evangelizing (not only Pagans, athiests, and religious nones - but other Christains who may have a bad idea or two concerning the One, Holy Church). But I always felt like a liar. I think I am a liar. A cheap third-world knock-off of stolen intellectual property that sells for a dollar cheaper than the genuine article on Amazon.

The last chapter of ""Mere Christianity"" sent my whole outlook into a tailspin. Infact, I can sum up the last several chapters in this one, short quout: ""The more we get what we now call 'ourselves' out of the way and let Him take us over, the more truly ourselves we become."" I'm a man that still hasn't figured out how to pray - how am I supposed to get out of my own way so He can step in, destroy the nature, and raise me to a new life? I feel like I'm cosplaying as a christain instead of actually being one.

There's a book that's been sitting on my shelf, nagging me. It's been whispering begging to be read. I'm afraid to read it because I have a good idea of what truths it contains and that I'm to intellectually stunted from a christain point of view to ever really understand its message. That book is ""Life of Christ"" by Fulton Sheen. What makes matters worse is that I'm pretending to be a Christain while being carted around in the Mercedes of denominations - the catholic church.

I don't even consider myself that religious yet, this idea is floating around. I'm willing to investigate the possibility of becoming a priest further but I don't know if I want to become a priest. I haven't take any formal steps or done any real research into what becoming or being a priest is like, the only thing I have are these vague feelings. But I still have reservations.

Angels and demons: Do they have spatial and temporal coordinates? Have we ever studied them? Are their powers granted or restricted by God?,Uninterrupted-Void,1622684749,"As far as I gather, demons and angels are a type of non-physical animal, a sort of ghost animal if you will, that doesn't have, want, or need a body. They are good as they are. They exist, without being ""made"" of anything.

But this makes me wonder: in what sense are they limited? I've heard William Lane Craig arguments for the existence of God, and saying that if he's spaceless and timeless, then he needs to be omnipotent and everywhere (because he isn't bound to a single location). So how are angels and demons restricted? They're not omnipresent or omnipotent. Let's look at demons, the failed and corrupted angels. Where do their powers come from, do they just innately have the ability to do things, like we do, but God stops them? Or does God affirmatively grant him the power to hurt people in limited circumstances?

Let's look at Satan, a failed angel. I'm not too sure what supposedly happened, but he wanted to be running the show for some reason, and he started a war. He ended up getting kicked out, and really hates God so much that he wants to damage and corrupt us.",Catholicism

Doctrine change on slavery?,ThemeOk969,1622680906," 1- The Church supported slavery in the past and there are a lot evidences of it, like for example:

A) Catholic Encyclopedia:

""From the beginning the Christian moralist did not condemn slavery as *in se*, or essentially, against the natural law or natural justice. The fact that slavery, tempered with many humane restrictions, was permitted under the Mosaic law would have sufficed to prevent the institution form being condemned by Christian teachers as absolutely immoral. They, following the example of St. Paul, implicitly accept slavery as not in itself incompatible with the Christian Law. The apostle counsels slaves to obey their masters, and to bear with their condition patiently. This estimate of slavery continued to prevail till it became fixed in the systematized ethical teaching of the schools; and so it remained without any conspicuous modification till towards the end of the eighteenth century.""

""Slavery consists in this, that a man is obliged, for his whole life, to devote his labour and services to a master. Now as anybody may justly bind himself, for the sake of some anticipated reward, to give his entire services to a master for a year, and he would in justice be bound to fulfil this contract, why may not he bind himself in like manner for a longer period, even for his entire lifetime, an obligation which would constitute slavery?"" 

Cardinal Gerdil (1718-1802): ""Slavery is not to be understood as conferring on one man the same power over another that men have over cattle. Wherefore they erred who in former times refused to include slaves among persons; and believed that however barbarously the master treated his slave he did not violate any right of the slave. For slavery does not abolish the natural equality of men: hence by slavery one man is understood to become subject to the dominion of another to the extent that the master has a perpetual right to all those services which one man may justly perform for another; and subject to the condition that the master shall take due care of his slave and treat him humanely.""

B) The Holy Office in 1886 said:

""Slavery itself, considered as such in its essential nature, is not at all contrary to the natural and divine law, and there can be several just titles of slavery and these are referred to by approved theologians and commentators of the sacred canons. For the sort of ownership which a slave- owner has over a slave is understood as nothing other than the perpetual right of disposing of the work of a slave for one's own benefit - services which it is right for one human being to provide for another. From this it follows that it is not contrary to the natural and divine law for a slave to be sold, bought, exchanged or donated, provided that in this sale, purchase, exchange or gift, the due conditions are strictly observed which the approved authors likewise describe and explain.""

1- But in recent times the Church said:

A)  Veritatis Splendor*:* ""Consequently, without in the least denying the influence on morality exercised by circumstances and especially by intentions, the Church teaches that **'there exist acts which** ***per se*** **and in themselves, independently of circumstances, are always seriously wrong by reason of their object'.** **The Second Vatican Council itself, in discussing the respect due to the human person, gives a number of examples of such acts:** ""Whatever is hostile to life itself, such as any kind of homicide, genocide, abortion, euthanasia and voluntary suicide; whatever violates the integrity of the human person, such as mutilation, physical and mental torture and attempts to coerce the spirit; whatever is offensive to human dignity, such as subhuman living conditions, arbitrary imprisonment, deportation, **slavery**, prostitution and trafficking in women and children; degrading conditions of work which treat labourers as mere instruments of profit, and not as free responsible persons: all these and the like are a disgrace, and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer injustice, and they are a negation of the honour due to the Creator"".

B) Catechism:  2414:The seventh commandment forbids acts or enterprises that for any reason - selfish or ideological, commercial, or totalitarian - lead to the *enslavement of human beings*, to their being bought, sold and exchanged like merchandise, in disregard for their personal dignity. It is a sin against the dignity of persons and their fundamental rights to reduce them by violence to their productive value or to a source of profit. St. Paul directed a Christian master to treat his Christian slave ""no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, ... both in the flesh and in the Lord.""

"Our bishop ended the dispensations of the Sunday obligation, but I'm 2 weeks away from being full vaccinated, about 5 for my sister, and my parents have no intend on getting the vaccine at all. I don't know if I should wait or go back to Mass.",Brelen_Raven,1622680688,"If I gave the word we'd probably start going back to Mass every week. My mom has been asking me when we should go back for weeks now, so if I said I wanted to go, we'd go. Only problem is I have my 2 weeks until I'm fully vaccinated and my little sister has about another... 4? 5?

If I told my parents to go to church to fulfil their obligations, they'd potentially get covid themselves and spread it to the whole house. But, I'm only 2 weeks away until I'm in the clear, 5 for my sister, so I wanna wait, but I don't know if it'd be a sin to keep my parents from their Sunday obligations by not reminding them of this... They already shop all over wherever every single day and at this point with vaccines rolling out to everyone it might be fine. But then again, church is full of singing and breathing the same air...

If they'd get the vaccine I'd be way more comfortable. They're 50-60 and they've been worrying me the last year. If you guys have any resources that'd possibly get them to just do it that'd be insanely helpful. It's less the cell line thing and more how it was ""rushed"" and gave out to the public.

TL;DR me and my sister are weeks away from being fully vaccinated, my parents aren't planning on getting the vaccine at all, and the dispensation from the Sunday obligation ended. Dunno if we should wait or not and don't know how to get my parents vaccinated.",Catholicism

Why have I been feeling like this for so long?,ClassicGalactic,1622679286,"So it's been 3 years since this happened. I was interested in Creepypastas. And I found this one called ""Rap Rat."" It was a story based off of an actual board game from the 1990's.

TL:DR

It said that if you say ""Aparat"" out loud, a Fear Demon will curse you and stalk you for the rest of your life.

And if you stayed up until 3:30-4:00 AM, that would be when it would be most likely to scare you.

Out of temptation, and me being a foolish, compulsive child, I said it out loud. I was horrified, and I got a bad muscle knot in my back. It's still there even today, even when I'm completely relaxed. It's always been there. It hasn't ached or hurt or anything, but it's just there.

I then started to suffer from random Anxiety and Intrusive thoughts. It felt like Urges to do horrible things that I didn't even want to do.

I researched this, and I found that everyone has had disturbing thoughts at least occasionally, and that the brain is tricked into feeling like it needs to take action.

I've suffered so much, and have subconsciously invented so much crap to be fearful about from time to time, it just feels like my past years were wasted. I get that I was just a gullible 12 year old at the time, but am I just a massive paranoid idiot?

I mean, I've read that simply saying a Demons name out loud won't work in summoning them unless you do an actual invocation. (Which I definitely don't want to do!)

Also, many YouTubers have narrated the story, and they've said the word many times, and they were all fine. Even years later, they are all still fine. I've also learned that ""Aparat"" means device in many Slavic languages. I've never seen any shadows chasing me, I've never heard voices in my head, I stayed up so many times, yet nothing actually happened all those times, even when I went through my short, young atheist phase.

I said the word over and over again to try and prove to myself that it was fake occasionally, and I even have mocked the name.

Nothing has happened though, and still no nightmares. Also, some YouTubers debunked the story when it said the real company behind it shut down in 1994. It didn't until later.

The writer even made a post 3 years later about it, so he's fine. So it's clearly fake.

So why do I still feel tense? Why have I been experiencing this for so long? Am I actually under attack by demons? Am I crazy? Am I just the biggest idiot to ever exist? Why did God let this happen?

I have a question. What Bible should we be using? By this I don't necessarily mean what ""version"" of the Bible to use. I mean, ""which Bible with how many books"" to use? 

I ask this because, as it turns out, not only are there Roman Catholic (73 books) and Protestant (66) Bibles, but also, the Orthodox use 80 to 81 books in their Bibles, and Copts use 84. 

Coming from Islam, in which we basically only have ONE defined Qur'an, it tends to be confusing.

Discerning which sins you are guilty of,uiolabv,1622666415,"So I am  having a problem regarding discerning which sins I am guilty of committing in the past. Because how do I distinguish imagination from memory? For the past 3-4 months I have had a thought of having committed a particular sin with its accompanying ""flashback"" or like a ""scene"" from the past. But it is hard to accept that I committed it. But I feel like I did. Maybe it's the anxiety or self doubt? But I have been fighting it trying to affirm that I did not commit it. This feeling and thought that I am guilty of it immediately makes me overwhelmed and I try to fight it just to feel like I am innocent or just to affirm I am innocent. There are times I say ""Yeah this is all just my imagination, doubt, etc."" but then it sometimes it feels to good to be true or feels valid for a while and then starts feeling like bias. 

Aside from that, this isn't something I can just confess by saying ""Forgive me father for I committed this, I think"" because its contents are atrocious. Which is why whenever I get the feeling that I am guilty of it I tend to resist it out of fear of its implications and consequences. I ended up trying to pray the 54 Day Miraculous Rosary Novena for better discernment. I just finished my 2nd Glorious Mystery prayer hours ago. It is so tiring trying to question of whether or not I did it. Because this is something I might have done 6 years ago but I am only having this problem now. Why didn't I feel distress before now? Was it because I didn't care to think about it? Or did it not occur? 

I am so tired of thinking I just want to take a break. Ideally I would consult a therapist but I am not financially independent and because of COVID. I prayed to God to give me an answer and my feeling and mind starts pointing towards me being guilty of it. So should I just react with a ""Case closed I am guilty of this."" or give myself more time? Perhaps I should talk about this with a priest.

Note: I do have some valid reasons why I am innocent of a particular sin but for some reason the feelings are stronger that they got me thinking ""why?"". Some are also too hard to explain that they might be memory and yet too hard to believe.

Teen Considering Converting to Catholicism,callemasala,1622663905,"Hello everyone! 

I'm a 17y/o Christian from Sweden. I was raised by a non-christian mother and a moderately Christian father, who's a member of the Swedish Equmenian (Baptist/Methodist) church, whose ancestors were very active in the Free Church movement in Sweden in the 1800s. I wasn't very religious growing up, but during the past year, I've been very interested in Christianity, specifically; Roman Catholicism. 

My growth in interest is mainly because of my love for its sophisticated, rich, and beautiful history, traditions, art, and literary legacy, especially compared to its Protestant counterpart. Also, I have a great urge to move to Italy in the future with my girlfriend, and I want my family to be fully integrated into Italian culture and society.

Due to my interest in Catholicism, I've bought and read the Catholic Church's catechism. I've also read about the church's sacraments, its prayers, its holy saints, and so on.

**The problem is**; I can't really explain to my parents why I want to convert to Catholicism. I also don't if my father would be angry or not, even though he has expressed pro-Catholic views in the past.

The dream was like this: 

I'm riding with two other persons in the catacombs under a big city. There are many dead there, some try to grab us as we fly by. It's dark, cold, I'm frightened and I realize that I might stay there with the dead. 

But we manage to escape and go home. 

Father Sheen is there. He is like a father to us, he tends us (as in, all of us) with tender affection, which is so beautiful an image of paternal care, of trust and relief, of ""feeling home"" that I can hardly describe it with words. But there he is, caring for us like a shepherd taking care of his sheep, humble and patient and dedicated. 

For whatever reason, at this moment in the dream I'm a child, or at least I feel like I've become one. I tell him: “Father, you know, we went through a valley of shadows and death and when I thought I was going to stay there with the dead, I realized who it is, that I'm most afraid of loosing when it's my turn to die.""

“If these were French-Canadian schools, it is possible that the [heresy of Jansenism](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08285a.htm) was part of the motivation behind the attempt to strip away native cultures and languages.

Jansenism was a heretical system, popular in France among other places, which attempted to blend Catholicism and Calvinism.  Essentially, it taught that man is totally depraved, so much so that the will is no longer free.  Either one is led by the natural desires of the Earth, which are sinful and hateful to God, or by the supernatural desires from God’s grace, which are morally good.

So, if our natures are inherently evil and everything we do in a natural sense is sin, and what we do after conversion is good, then this has big implications for missionary work.  It would mean that the pre-Christian cultures of the natives are evil and the product of sin, while the cultures of Christians are good, and we should throw out the sinful fruits of the pagans and replace with our good culture that comes from Christian grace.  That might be part of the inspiration here.

True Catholic teaching is that our human nature is wounded, but not totally depraved.  Our will is free, but weakened.  We can do some natural good, but it does not do anything for our salvation.  We need the elevation of God’s grace for that.  So grace builds on nature, it does not replace it.

So, as Catholics, we can be more like [Fr. Matteo Ricci in China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_China_missions), not trying to replace their culture, but to incorporate it and Christianize it.  We can acknowledge what is good in them, since not all of it is the product of sin.”",Catholicism

What is the importance of the doctrine of Mary's perpetual virginity?,CBaldie,1622656232,"I'm a Presbyterian.

I recently saw a snarky post from a fellow protestant in a theologically oriented group on Facebook about Mary and Joseph's physical relationship after the birth of the Lord.  Some of the Roman Catholics in the group responded in a way that has had me thinking.  Their response was, to put it mildly, very strong.  The hurt and outrage surprised me and me me realize: I do not understand the place that the doctrine of Mary's perpetual virginity holds in the hearts and minds of Roman Catholics.  And I want to understand it.

Please note: My question is not about the doctrine itself or about the arguments for it or against it.  I believe I understand those.  I've read a lot about the biblical, historical, and traditional arguments.  My question is about the high value of the doctrine.

For example: As St. Paul makes clear, if we Christians are wrong about the doctrine of the Resurrection of Christ, our Faith is in vain.  If we Christians are wrong about the doctrine of the Trinity, then we are worshiping a false conception of God and have become idolaters.  If we Protestants and Orthodox are wrong about Papal infallibility, then we are failing to submit to the true Vicar of Christ on earth, and by extension failing to submit to Christ Himself.  If we Protestants are wrong about transubstantiation, then we are failing to properly worship the Lord in violation of the First Commandment.

Having correct theology is important in general because we want to worship the One True God in Spirit and in Truth, and if when our ideas about God are incorrect, our prayer and worship are at best improperly directed and at worst we are idolaters.

Along the same lines, I have changed my mind significantly about several important theological issues, and I think I can say that those changes always started with a shift in my perspective about how important something was.

So what is the importance of Mary's perpetual virginity?  Why does it matter?  What is the cost of getting it wrong?  What am I missing out on if I don't believe in it?  Why does it resonate with you personally?  Or can you point me to a resource?

I have asked several of my Roman Catholic friends, and their answers have largely been that it is important because the Church teaches it.  One friend said that my question is a ""very Protestant"" question and that Roman Catholicism can't be analyzed that way.  It must simply be accepted whole-cloth.  So maybe there is no answer to my question, but I'm hoping.

We never talked about marriage once, besides the priest once saying don't have sex before marriage and don't get divorced.  There was this lazy belief that marriage will just happen.  We need more than just videos that show people marriage looks nice.  I don't think we need complete arranged marriages, but we need more of a structure around the time before marriage.

Good is not the opposite of evil,BalmoraBoy,1622651660,"It's important that as Christians we do our best to get rid of other religions' influences in our own faith. Our faith has a profound understanding of good and evil that makes our worldview stand out uniquely among the rest: an argument about good and evil that has been white-washed by Eastern (and not the Christian kind) philosophy and religion. We should dispel two specific common tropes from Christian and Western thinking: that goodness is earned transactionally, and that good and evil are equal and opposite forces.


**THE KARMIC FALLACY, OR GRACE AS A TRANSACTION**


The modern Eastern-influenced understanding of good and evil comes down to a balance: a narrative of two opposing forces. This seeps its way into common cultural notions of ""karma"", an ""exchange"", or ""transaction"". ""Don't cut someone off in traffic — that's bad karma!"" ""Ah, I am hoping for some good karma today! Hear me, universe?""

All that is good comes from God, and all that comes from God is a grace. Nothing can be earned. One faucet of this is expressed by Jesus in the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard:

&gt;Matthew 20:14-15
'...Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?'

The only fairness we are to expect will be at the judgement in the next life, not this one. Of course, it is evident that God helps us, loves us, and we should always lean on him. Even when He, as He often does, chooses to bless those that are doing good, that are fighting sin, that are repenting, He does so out of His own grace, His own love and prerogative: we are not karmic tally-sheets, we are children. Love is the freely giving of oneself— a choice, and we should help others because we choose to love our neighbors and we choose to love God.

This lesson hit me hardest in my own life during a period of unemployment. I basically told myself I was going to have a spiritual pilgrimage ""to get closer to God."" Being completely honest with myself now: it wasn't to get closer to God, it was to get a job. I wasn't putting God first, I was putting what I wanted first. I had a particularly sinless and ""flawless"" month, I even went to daily Mass for two weeks in a row. After watching 0 hits come in, and having all my friends (including you guys) praying for me, I felt like nothing was happening. My bank account was in the double digits and I was mentally spiraling. Nothing was ""working"".

So I lashed out. I went and got drunk, and the next day, did the same. That whole week I just fell into sin and ignored God and the Church...

Monday the next week, I had an interview. The next day, I got a job offer.

I was floored. Baffled. It took me a day or two to understand why God let that happen the way He did. And the conclusion was to teach me that His Graces are not transactional: we cannot earn them; indeed, we don't deserve them. They are His gifts to us. And what's the best way to ruin someone's pleasure of giving? To expect a gift. 

How different is this than the karmic philosophy we entertain, if not implicitly embrace, today? Karma is expected, demandful, and arrogant. Graces are humbling, joyful, and unexpected. One is built on a cosmic entitlement: the other on love, trust, and gratefulness.

**GOOD AND EVIL ARE NOT EQUAL OPPOSITES**

I'd wager to guess that the vast majority of the Western population, and even a majority of those raised Christian, would reflexively answer this question wrong:

Who is the archnemesis of Satan?

Let's turn to Revelations for this answer.

&gt;Revelation 12:7-10
Then a war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place is heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.

The primary enemy of Satan is not God: it is Saint Michael the Archangel. 

Eastern philosophy, yin-and-yang, necessitates that we should balance good and evil as opposing forces. A little bit of vice, a little bit of virtue. It necessitates that good and evil ""need"" each other, that they are scales that should be balanced.

God created the world, and saw that it was good (G. 1:31).  He did not create evil. Evil is the twisting of good, the corruption of it, and both Satan and God's champion against him are both His creatures. God is good and all goodness extends from Him. In this way, Satan's primary enemy cannot be God: because God is good and good is so much greater than evil. Good is the natural state of everything, until we choose to invite, to do, or to accept evil. Saying that good and evil are opposites would be like saying a dent is the opposite of a suit of armor.

This profound understanding is being lost in our society, particularly in the face of growing New Age influences, and a waning understanding of Christianity. We should strive to reclaim the true relationship between and definitions of good and evil.

Called to Catholicism after leaving a cult,Rassesenpai,1622641587,"For context, I was associated in a restorationist nontrinitian cult/faith for almost a decade. I left the faith in 2019 after reading about their sexual abuse coverup, bad theology, antisemitism and borderline conspiracy theories about biblical history. I was done with religion and, stupidly enough, made sure my believing mother that I absolutely hated the faith.  

After leaving I felt a strong emptiness inside of me – this was a huge part of my identity for a long time, but now it’s all gone. Then my school offered a bunch of philosophy, literature and history classes which mentioned such individuals as St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Augustine, St. Dominic and Dante Alighieri – I started to take interest in the Catholic Church. I read books, watched documentaries and films on the Catholic Church and their teachings – basically did my own catechism.

Calvinism and Catholicism,attic-orator,1622638712,"I am a Presbyterian convert to Catholicism. I want to put down this question, one with an entangled history and path, concerning Calvinism and Catholicism. In the past, I've noted essays arguing for their compatibility, notwithstanding their pronounced conflict hereto. These long-form or extended essays have been written by advocates of each, including I believe John Henry Newman. And there is the contemporary issue of David Bentley Hart, which I leave to you because I have not read him, nor do I have the time to give it my careful attention.

My focus was always questions of grace and the problematic of predestination, not theological quibbles. And yet, to the extent I found myself asking and answering themes involving grace and nature, reading Cartesian or Pascalian philosophy, I was drawn into the chaos. I like to periodically get my understanding of predestination straight, whenever it devolves into vagaries of destiny and not the principled conception of my Calvinist youth. These rigidities are increasingly rare, in today's world of miscommunication.

To emphasize differences, distinctions, etc. is all fair play: though it's not, in the long-run, what has yielded insight into the matter. There's a deeper history in the Church of predestination and its logic which hasn't been turned over since Calvin's day, and quite frankly Calvin has been demonized to the point of no return in today's culture along with Catholic social ethics.

Hello I’m raised a catholic but I don’t know how the rosary works,Opening_Ad_1167,1622613937,Hi I’m 22 years old I need help on how to pray with rosary or how to start. I’ve been going to church sometimes every sundays but I need like a rosary on how to do it when I pray by myself . I go to church as well on a weekdays to pray bymyself just go there and “do the name of the father the son and the Holy Spirit amen cross” I need help to start praying with a rosary. Thank you. I also have another questions. I always try to give homeless people money or when I can. Is that okay like sometimes I feel like they are taking advantage or should be looking for work at least. I just need help to clarify this as well. I love helping people and don’t want to be taken advantage of. Thank you,Catholicism
Do you start over a prayer if you messed up a part?,ufogunsaliens,1622613459,"Whenever I mess up a part of a prayer, I get distracted by my mistake. My most common mistake is repeating the first half of the Hail Mary instead of its conclusion, but it is not nearly limited to that.

3)  He also mentions that praying to Mary or praying to those who have passed away is against the Bible, and that God/Jesus is the only person we should pray to.

Hey Catholics!

As I've been studying Church History, there's been a few questions niggling at my mind, and I can't seem to find a succinct/relevant answer online.

When studying the history of the Papacy and Ecumenical Councils, I notice that there are several ""threads"" that one could possibly follow, and that their histories aren't nice and linear as one may expect. I am, of course, referring to the anti-popes and ""ecumenical councils"" that have been invalidated/nullified by succeeding pontiffs. 

My question is this: How does/did the Church distinguish the correct Pope from the Antipope (when both sides had Apostolic Succession and claimed legitimate election), and how does/did she recognize invalid councils (even though some of them had Papal mandates/approval)?

Very confused on Catholicism,Sensitive_Row8855,1622600805,"Hello, I've been having some thoughts after researching different Christian denominations, and this has led me to much confusion.

On one hand I don't believe much of what these other denominations believe in, their traditions don't make much sense to me, even sola scriptura has multiple issues, the problem I have is with their claims against the church.

There not being a mention of mary's intercession in scripture and the involvement of her in our lives I could not get someone to teach me well enough, maybe I just simply don't have enough knowledge. This and the bible saying christ is the ultimate mediator, unsureness on saints and how they are involved, its all just confusing and I am not knowledged enough to dismiss their claims, but when they make claims that are incredibly hard for me to dismiss, they also make claims that are super easy to dismiss, like their claims against the eucharist makes 0 sense and Christs teaching on it being his true body and blood is rightful and biblical.

So now i'm in a situation wondering why my religion gets more and more confusing the more I gain knowledge in what the teachings actually mean, so much so that I stopped praying the rosary when I used to pray it near daily, just because I'm so unsure of everything and don't want to offend my lord, any advice on how to get out of this confused mindset.",Catholicism

Stop asking for reassurance. Stop focusing on what you can or cannot do.

This deeply troubles me.  I spent years with terrible scrupulosity as a Roman Rite Catholic and I see on this page that many of you are trapped in that fear.  I don’t know the solution for this disease in our Church, but at the least it must begin with the reminder that you are loved beyond comprehension by our Lord.

“It’s all part of God’s plan”… not really?,MikeJr1311,1622585231,"Background info: I was looking through some memes, found one that was about God and creating bad people, sending them to hell and the devil punishing them, making God evil and the devil good (which I found funny but obviously that isn’t true, God is good). I was just looking through the comments and found this person response to another person talking about “God’s Plan.”

“Ok then why do people always say [s-word] like ‘it's all part of God's plan’ and ‘God works in mysterious ways’ when bad shit happens?

Even if what you are saying is true [talking about the person who said that people chose to be bad, God didn’t make them bad], God still created cancer and all these other terrible diseases that effect everyone including small innocent children.

Why does god allow children to be born to methheads who were just too messed up to remember a condom, but [well] educated loving people have miscarriage after miscarriage?

Face it. Either God doesn't exist, or is not nearly as powerful as many people claim, or he is a total piece of [s-word].”

My response to this is:

It is true that some Christians do say that, but because there’s really no other explanation. As a catholic, here’s an explanation for those questions…

God did not create cancer, but it’s something that doesn’t come out of nowhere (if the that makes sense). It happens to people, and sometimes it’s because of people’s actions too (Like smoking cigarettes = lung cancer). For diseases, it’s like survival of the fitness since those little guys have to survive too. And in order to keep their family tree, they must spread. They depend on us to survive, and that’s just the science behind it (and again, sometimes it’s people’s actions like not washing their hands or not wearing a mask).

Again, it’s not in God’s control on who’s born or who can’t have them. What God can do is take advantage of anything when the time is appropriate.

Sadly, people see Catholicism as the religion of negation, fasting, rules, etc. but they do not see that it is for a reason, namely virtue.  They fail to realize that the rules set us in line with our nature, not with our fallen dispositions which bring nothing but discontentment.  Some think that fasting and mortification is a constant practice for all states of life!  The person I mentioned earlier is always in a poor mood despite having a loving Catholic family and a good life, despite being “free” from the rules that “restrict” her.

Catholics enjoy things, too.  This is done moderately and also for the glory of God.  As a matter of fact, I am restoring old furniture and making a documentary about the Wii this summer.  Doesn’t it seem like people who live lavishly never have peace while people who live with simple pleasures enjoy life more?  It’s because we realize that while life is enjoyable, there is happiness and peace in God presence and Heaven, not just in feeding our appetites.

But still, I see no apparent advance. I hate sin, but I’m still a slave, and can’t find a way out of it. I confess exactly the same things every time. I am sick of it. I want to pray, yet I’m so inconsistent at it. I often get strong headaches that don’t help at all with prayer or with battling the sins that drive my life. I see how can this be a blessing. But I don’t get anything good out of it. I see how God gives great graces to great sinners, but I don’t seem to get any of them. Or at least, not enough grace to bear any good spiritual fruit out of my life. Why?

Has anyone been in a similar spot? What got you out of it? Any tips or prayers are welcome. Thank you.",Catholicism

I am sorry if that might go against the subreddit’s rule, if so, I ask the admins to remove it, thank you.

I am actually looking to become friends with Catholic guys as I don’t have much Catholic friends and even more with guys as I have almost only female friendships and only very few male friendships.

 There are many posts about the LGBTQ community on this subreddit right now, as pride month has just started. I am simply wondering, why do you all care so much? There are a small handful of easily misinterpreted verses in the bible about these topics, and so many more about giving to the community and loving your fellow humans. And yet, Leviticus 18:22 seems to be held above the others.

Middle-class living is not the norm,theotokosprayforus,1622569173,"I noticed that a lot of people in their 20s and 30s complain about how our market has failed us and how we can't afford to buy property, can't afford to get married, can't afford to have children, etc. 

I live in Canada, I'm in my early 20s, just graduated last year and landed a really nice middle-class office job. My husband already started his career before we got married. We paid around \~$1200 for our wedding with immediate family only. And yes, I am aware of how expensive weddings can be (in my city the average cost is $30,000+), but if you just have the ceremony plus dinner for immediate family only -- it is very affordable! I know cause my husband and I did that last year. 

We are currently renting a 2 bedroom apartment and since we're still paying off our student loans, we can't afford to start saving for a house just yet. Even after we pay off our student loans, by the looks of it, we probably won't be able to afford a house for a longggggg time. And that's ok! 

I know young people love to complain about how unaffordable everything is, but I guess I have a different perspective because my parents were immigrants from a poor country. I visited the mother land too and visited the houses they grew up in and boy..... it made me realize how you really don't need that much to live. My dad lived in a 2 bedroom house with 7 siblings. My mom lived in a 3 bedroom house with 8 siblings. My grandparents on both sides worked. My grandparents didn't even finish elementary school and began working in their family businesses as mere children. My parents didn't go on vacations, get new clothes, new gadgets, etc. as kids. They had the bare necessities, but they still made it. 

When my parents first came to Canada, they lived in a shitty cockroach-filled basement apartment with 12 other people (my mother's family and their spouses). Then our families bought 2 semi-detached houses where 4 families and my grandparents lived. My parents worked full-time jobs, were in school part-time and had me. My grandparents took care of all of us cousins while our parents were at work and at school. Inter-generational living is the norm in my culture, as my grandparents lived with me my whole life even when my parents were eventually able to buy a house of their own. 

I'm very grateful for my childhood and for my family. That's why I am extremely grateful for my middle-class income. To some people, my salary doesn't look like that much money. But to someone who grew up with parents who first started working minimum wage, hell it's a lot of money. I also grew up in the innercity where most of my classmates lived in apartments and they were being raised by single moms. A house is not a right. It's a privilege. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad to want middle-class living. It's not a sin to be disappointed by the housing market. It's not a sin to want a high paying job. But I wanted to share my story to put into perspective on how not everyone grows up with a single-detached house, yearly vacations, 2 cars, new gadgets and new clothes, eating out weekly... and they turn out fine. I just wanted to put into perspective how this middle-class way of living really is not the norm... We need to cultivate hearts of gratitude for all that God has given us.",Catholicism
Reparation - Does God put off healing so the injurer can participate in repairing the damage he's done?,rememberuhavetodie,1622569144,"Out of restorative justice, we have give back what was taken by our sin. For example, if I stole $500, then I return that $500. Another example, if I slander someone's name, I have to restore their reputation. God gives us a chance to participate in restoring those things, since He is the one who ultimately heals all wrong. We can try to fix everything perfectly, but that's like trying to clean a window with a dirty rag...you're going to leave streaks. 

However, in this day and age, there's been a HUGE aversion to repairing the damage that we've causes by our sins. People think they are perfect as soon as they've confessed the sin. This isn't the case; they are responsible for the damage they've incurred. For example, (since all sin incorporates the will) if I intentionally break my friend's arm, then I would lose that friendship, go to jail, AND have to pay for the medical expenses to fix the arm. Is God's law less just than ours? Of course not! If we are truly sorry, the confession will restore our friendship, remit the jail time, and we'd still have to pay the medical expenses. Also, the more we love our friend, the more we are willing to pay for the medical expenses. 

How does this relate to the title? God doesn't fix things right away. We all know this. I just wonder if the reason for this is because He is giving the injurer an opportunity to participate in His justice.

How to deal with Pride Month at my school.,Pale-Cold-Quivering,1622568079,"So my school had decided to give us a non-uniform day in celebration of ‘Pride’ month. 

My school is very progressive so colour me pleasantly surprised when I heard that there was a fairly large group, of mainly boys, who were planning to not participate. You can choose to still come into school in uniform but hardly anyone does. It’s is quite a big deal to actively choose not to do it- and it’s very noticeable. 

This group planned to simply not wear it as to show we weren’t supporting pride. Unfortunately, it got uncovered and the ringleaders were dealt with severely. Even so, they can’t stop us. 

However my fear was that, in wearing uniform, people would assume I hate gay people instead of simply gay relations. I thought this would be the sin of scandal. So I planned to wear an outfit with no colour in it instead. Yet, I still feel this is caving in.

Definition of Usury from Lateran V,mhumpher,1622563573,"I have occasionally heard that Lateran V proposes the following definition of usury: ""when, from its use, a thing that produces nothing is applied to the acquiring of gain and profit without any work, any expense, or any risk."" Indeed, in the index of my copy of Denzinger (Ignatius Press 2010), it states this as the definition of usury directing the reader to the passage from the 10th Session of the Fifth Lateran Council. However, reading the full context in which the definition is found should dissuade anyone from the belief that the definition is proposed by the Council. (see [https://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum18.htm](https://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum18.htm))

The definition arises out the controversy concerning the Montes Pietatis, charitable lending organizations. The first part lays out the difficulties between those who oppose the Montes, those who support them and the need for the Council to settle the question. The next section explains the position of those doctors and theologians who argue that the Montes are usurious. This is followed by the position of those who support Montes. Finally, the Council declares the Montes as not usurious and excommunicates anyone who preaches against them. 

The definition of usury appears in the middle of the section explaining the position of the doctors opposed to the Montes. A fair reading of the text gives the impression that the definition is proposed by those doctors - not the Council - to explain the usurious nature of the Montes. Moreover, since the Council ultimately decides against these doctors, it is even harder to attribute the Council's authority to this definition. 

Now that definition may or may not be consistent with what the Church teaches, but it appears mistaken to suggest that the definition has Magisterial approval or weight to it.",Catholicism

"Thanks to some stupid Protestant pastors, I could become a Catholic",Leading-Reporter-848,1622551337," I was a faithful(?) atheist. I strongly believed in atheism and believed religions are evil.

Then I got a girlfriend, whom I really loved. her family was a practicing, commited protestant family, you didn't even acknowledge Catholicism as a decent Christian denomination.

I went to several protestant churches to talk with many pastors to hear why their beliefs were right. and Sometimes, they said their denomination is right, saying Catholic church for example, does not follow the bible and they worship Mary.

I thought it was weird. Catholic church is definitely the first denomination of Christianity and it does not make sense to believe that Catholic church used to follow the bible and worship Jesus, and then one day one Catholic said ""Hey, let's throw our holy book away and believe another god! how about Jesus' mother?"" and it was accepted by the majority, and then many years later a priest called Martin Luther said ""Hey, let's change it again. how about believing in Jesus and say the bible is right?""

It just didn't make sense to me. That's when I started to study Christianity.

The more I studied Christianity, the more I was sure that Jesus was my saviour and the pastors I talked with were constantly lying. Catholic church was the definitely the church that Jesus had built and respect apostles.

It makes me happy that I finally found the true church, but at the same time it is sad that there are false prophets that mislead people to distorted faiths. We should be more active to explain our true faiths and convince people. But at the same time, don't forget to treat them with love.

Surely for ex-communicable offenses it’s more than just a confession. Boris is considered an Catholic but he also insists he is CoE - and also said he was an atheist. I think he also wanted to convert to Islam for a while there.

For such offenses and creating scandal on an international level shouldn’t he be expected to publicly denounce his behaviour?  I’m not",Catholicism

A question about LOTH books?,bitnil,1622542127,"Hi everyone, 

So I am Orthodox as you may notice from my profile. However I have a question about one of the Liturgy of the Hours books, specifically ***""A shorter morning and evening prayer"".***

I am looking for something that has all the psalms in one place. Does this book have all the psalms? I don't mind if I have to flip it around a bit to find what I'm looking for.

Orthodox have our own psalters, but they are usually much more expensive, especially ones in english, on average they cost around $30+, PLUS international shipping, and then PLUS whatever customs fees that come afterward. I can't really get one where I live without spending at least $50 or more.

That's why I'm looking at the book mentioned (shorter morning and evening prayer), it only costs around $8-10 where I live. Not ideal, but if it has all the psalms I could just skip out the bits I don't need.

Please advise, Thanks!",Catholicism

I have an issue with, and have had an issue with how some of our Catholic family treats sinners. I’m open to your feedback, of course, as to what I can do better. Or where I’m wrong.

But it seems to me that sometimes we can lack compassion and charity towards people whose lifestyles are contrary to Catholic values and contrary to God’s will. We are quick to point out more what’s wrong with society rather than trying to empathize with, and charitably work with others. It’s not even June 1st here in California and I’ve already seen posts about why it’s bad that it’s pride month. Why do we have to spend so much time in our “Two minutes hate” when we could focus instead on trying to lovingly understand and bring home our sinful brothers and sisters? I understand we are fighting a moral war and that this is important but I also want to bring people with same sex attraction to the Church. To our fellow Catholics what we doing is good and our cause is important. God meets us half ways, and I just feel like we should meet others halfway too and focus more on compassion for sinners, without condoning their actions of course, but still being heartfelt towards them.

Some have a tendency to be by the book about things in a cold, logical sort of morality that seems to be more about rules and laws than explaining why God’s Law is fundamentally based on goodness and love. 

Can we focus on God’s Truth in a way that is compassionate towards sinners? We all sin.",Catholicism

(Politics Monday) Political bias on this sub,tastypasta18,1622522759,"I love how zealous everyone on this subreddit is in upholding and defending very unpopular truths on matters such as abortion, homosexuality, contraception, marriage, divorce and transgenderism. However, on other issues, the popular stance in this sub often seems to align more with the position of the Republican Party than that of the Magisterium. I have noticed this with regard to issues such as the death penalty, immigration, climate change, guns, economic issues, and rhetoric regarding racial and other issues. I understand that it is very easy to fall into partisanship given the nature of American culture in general and the attention that we rightfully give to the aforementioned social issues, but we should try very hard to make sure that we don’t become attached to any party or worldly ideology and that we allow our faith to inform our political engagement rather than the reverse. The truth diverges very sharply from both major parties, which both support significant evil, and our recognition of it should be entirely independent of our nationality, party affiliation, and any other environmental or personal factors. The Church’s teachings on every issue are beautifully interconnected, and nothing can be neglected for the sake of a party platform, worldliness, or popularity. Left-leaning Catholics tend to have the same struggle but in reverse, and it is very hard to find people who are consistently Catholic in every manner and on every issue.

"Lust and confession, I want your 2 cents",adrianwall,1622509324,"Hello,

I want to share with you a thought I had and I will be applying for now on for I don't know how long. I want your 2 cents on it even if I know exactly what most will say.  It about confession and lust as the title suggest. 

I'v been struggling with this recurring sins since I return to church a couple years ago now. I never had a problem with masturbation per se or porn and I still consider not having any however as a good catholic I try my very best to avoid sins of any kind and I go to confession as soon as possible when I do major one. In the past few years the highlight of my confession always was 'father, I have masturbate x time since my last confession and/or watch porn x time while masturbating.

In the past few months Iv really did my best to cut down on lust and I noticed that when I fall it's about once a week and porn is now pretty much inexistant. What I wanna say is, I honestly don't think for now (at this age and stage in my life) I can cut it out completely (masturbation I mean, porn is out and no coming back). Like you imagine when Iv not fall for say 6-8 days it seems to be physiological I think and  I feel it and it's very distracting. I end up falling and then the cicle restart if I can put it like this. I am good for another 'week or so' without even thinking about it.

My conclusion or thought is this... If I fall once in a week, I'll obviously repent and pray the act of contrition at home but nothing more. I'll consider this as a normal part of my body like a physiological need to relax (no porn nothing obviously). If tho I fall more than once, I'll go to confession and forget the idea completely. This way, I'll do my very best to keep it under wrap (in the last couple of months its been once a week anyway). 

I just read it back and put on 'paper' it sound real bad but the idea that push this is I am tired of confessing this sin over and over when I really think that once a week is a natural part of my body (when done naturally without porn or stuff). I really think it will help me focus on other part of my life and remove the shame and guilt associated with it. 

I'll pray over this and read your comment. I know you guys will highly suggest me not doing this and I am not the first and last to suggest cutting corner like this.. But come times in life where it's a choice btwn stopping going to confession and almost becoming protestant or doing this for a time. Sigh.. 

Anyway.. hopefully prayer will help me one way or the other.",Catholicism

"what does ""reverent novus ordo"" mean?",zshguru,1622505737,"A music nerd friend has been attending the TLM at an ""oratory"" here and he suggested I give it a try.  That is what started my research into the TLM b/c I had thought it was long dead. 

Before I go further, I'm not trying to start a flame war or piss anyone off with this post.  That may happen but it's not my intent.  I'm just trying to understand something that keeps coming up *over and over and over and over and ove*r in my research.

I've spent a few weeks doing basic research and the thing that keeps coming up every single time some ""professional Catholic"" talks about the Latin Mass is something to the effect of ""The Novus Ordo is fine, *if you can find a* *reverent* one.""  Hmm.  Well that's ""Catholic Twitter.""  The internet is a wild world after all.

But then I started watching this 9 hour video series the oratory produced about the TLM.  Somewhere in the first video the Monsignor/Rector of the oratory mentioned he ""felt the need to give a disclaimer about the Novus Ordo"" and again he uses the same language that everyone else uses ""The Novus Ordo is fine, *if you can find a reverent one.*

This language implies to me, at least, that it would be the exception to find a reverent NO Mass.

I can ignore Catholic Twitter to some extent even if the consensus is all the same.  But the rector officially represents the diocese here in a formal manner.  This ""oratory"" is designated by the Bishop to be one of the places sanctioned to only provide the extraordinary form of the Mass and all the Sacraments.  

If he's saying this, like how bad is the NO Mass?  It's been ages since I was last in a Mass (thanks Covid) so I don't even remember.  I think my local run-of-the-mill parish does a NO reverent, but how can I know?",Catholicism

I was answering a post in r/CatholicDating about social groups and felt that this should be posted here as well.

Check and see if there are any Discipleship Quads going on in your parish. It’s a program from the Franciscan University of Steubenville. Just you and three other guys (or women), and you go through scripture, how the scripture relates to your life, your relationship with God and how your week has gone. The questions are meant to be conversation starters. It’s a time to be vulnerable with the group and it has been absolutely amazing for my bros and myself. It’s supposed to be an 1 1/2 hour discussion but we end going at least 30 minutes over bc we jive so well. We’re about to go get some drinks and food in the next few weeks. We also had a huge gathering last week for all ongoing Quad groups as this is the second year it’s been going and it is awesome to see how large it’s gotten. Next year’s gathering is gonna have to be a dang lakeside barbecue 😂.

You meet once a week, and dedicate your time to that group for a year. Once it’s done, you’ll grab three others and start leading your own group.

If you can’t find one at your parish, then talk to your priest about starting one, bc the first official group actually begins with him.

How does levitation work?,GregsJam,1622498934,"I have heard about multiple saints levitating while in prayer (St Teresa of Avila and St Joseph of Cupertino are the two that come to mind), and have also heard of people levitating associated with other religions/meditation/demonic stuff. My question is, what is going on to directly cause the levitation?

Is God lifting people up? Angels? Devils? Is gravity suspended for that person? Or is it some part of human nature being activated maybe?

I was prompted to ask because I saw a comment saying devils can't affect the physical world, which makes sense, but made me wonder about these cases. 

For the record, I am not looking to learn to levitate. Just think it's interesting",Catholicism

[Politics Monday] Canadian governments should stop publicly funding catholic schools,theotokosprayforus,1622486452,"There I said it! Catholic schools here in Canada (at least in Ontario, I don't know about other provinces) are basically secular public schools with the term ""catholic"" in it. I never went to catholic school as i'm a convert, and it was difficult to get into catholic schools because they apparently have better funding than secular public schools so everyone wanted to attend.

The catholic name in these schools is only causing scandal and confusion. My husband went to catholic school his whole life as a non-practicing cradle catholic, and he said that he learned how to use birth control at sex ed. They also fly the pride flag at catholic schools. They don't teach about catholic/Christian teachings at these schools anyway, according to my husband and to other friends I have that attended catholic schools their whole lives. Heck, I lived in an immigrant majority neighbourhood where most people were not Christian, and so the majority of the students at the catholic school beside my public school were not even Christian, let alone catholic. My priest said that once he shared the gospel at a catholic high school, and the teacher told him not to say that...because we have to be inclusive. Why is it called a catholic school then????

My non-practicing cradle catholic friend told me that everyone received the eucharist at her school, even the non-catholics. She didn't even know that you needed to be in a state of grace (via confession) to receive the eucharist! She learned this from me, a convert.

If there is no difference between public catholic and public secular schools, why even bother making this distinction? I know that it's because of some law from way back then, but really I would rather just see the catholic school boards merge with the public ones.",Catholicism

May: The Month of Mother Mary and How I Felt Her Love,PencilScratches,1622474360,"&amp;#x200B;

[My Humble Prayer Space](https://preview.redd.it/pxa64b9c3h271.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1444331a786bec79f94f7411b2ff6892bab4569)

Today I completed 31 days of praying the Holy Rosary and my soul has never been this peaceful. I picked up the Holy Rosary late April when I got myself into trouble. I lost friends and colleagues due to that incident. I couldn't rely on my friends 24/7 for support because I understand they have lives of their own to live. I guess it's true when people say that children always run first to their mothers when they're in trouble and so I did. When I felt I have no one to run to, Mother Mary was there. She was ready to listen and comfort me any time of the day. 

On the first weeks of May, I didn't have an altar that I could pray on so I made a space on my desk where I can place a candle, The Bible, and my  Rosary. Praying the Rosary was comforting because it always places me on a meditative and contemplative state, far away from my troubles. From praying the rosary I was able to seek comfort from our Mother. When I felt the world was crumbling down on me, She was there assuring that things will always turn for the better. I really felt she was listening because sometimes mid-prayer I would realize some things that were answers to some of the questions that have been bothering me. 

On the later weeks of May, the image of the Immaculate Conception that I got from the Manila Cathedral showed itself. I felt like Elizabeth given a visit by Mother Mary to assure me that things will continue to be okay. I thought I lost the image when I was setting up my prayer space but lo and behold it was in the Bible all along. She was with me for the longest time that I was praying the Holy Rosary. Oh what happy day indeed it is for me. Now when I pray the rosary I have a beautiful image of our Mother Mary to Adore. 

Last Sunday in the celebration of The Holy Trinity I attended mass. I was pondering on buying a new rosary and the one made of wooden beads at the parish store looked really neat compared to the plastic one I'm using but I could not afford to buy myself a new one.. Besides, the one that I use to pray works just the same. Good thing I carried that Rosary to mass and I presented it to the priest. Gladly he blessed it and I couldn't stop smiling from ear to ear. Now I'm just more attached to it especially it's always been with me through my journey of reconnecting myself to our Faith. 

I couldn't be more thankful, really. I believe I now already have Mother Mary in my heart and the Rosary as a habit. When I find myself in a better place  and in a better time, I'm gonna make an altar for our Lord and our Mother to remind myself that they were always with me throughout my journey. I was lost and they anchored me back down. I shall never wander far away from them and keep them in my heart.

It was a May Magnificent May for me. I hope it is for you too.

This just got me thinking about how far we are responsible for following government rules.


I have a feeling we will all pay a price for abortion and letting this go on right under our noses. There is never any debate on violence to resolve it, I can't seem to see how this fits with historical use of violence to end mass killings like the concentration camps in WW2. Those adults were far more capable of defending themselves compared to unborn children, no-one quibbles with the justification for taking up arms to liberate those camps but strangely because abortion is carried out by doctors and in broad daylight it's not justified to save human lives in the same fashion?


Does the Church decide what is just? Did all those Catholics who signed up to fight in WW2 wait for the pope to give the green light, or did they just justify it in their own heart and go?


The churches stance on abortion is clear, it *is* murder so morally are we not obliged to defend innocent life in the same way we are morally obliged to fight in a war to do it? What is the difference? Is it purely down to numbers or do we need government support? What if the government is corrupted or part of the problem like approving abortion?

L'analyste politique Jérôme Fourquet, directeur du département d'opinion de l'Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), a publié ce mois-ci un livre intitulé *L'archipel français: naissance d'une nation multiple et divisée*, présentant des données désespérantes concernant le déclin du catholicisme en France. L'étude, une analyse multidimensionnelle des facteurs qui ont profondément affecté la fragmentation actuelle de la société française, présente des chiffres si bas pour l'Église catholique que Fourquet y voit plus qu'une ""sonnette d'alarme"", mais le prélude officiel de la fin de la France chrétienne, la disparition de la ""fille aînée de l'Église"".

Le détachement de la France à l'égard du christianisme est si fort que Fourquet définit cette époque comme une ""ère post-chrétienne"" car ""le déplacement de la société française de sa matrice catholique est presque total.""

Les récents chiffres confirment une tendance qui n'a fait que s'accentuer depuis la Révolution française. À l'heure actuelle, seuls 4 % des Français vont régulièrement à la messe le dimanche (8 % dans les zones rurales), les mariages civils représentent plus de 60 % de l'ensemble des mariages, et si la baisse se poursuit, la France pourrait baptiser son dernier enfant dans la foi catholique d'ici 2048.

Il est probable qu'en 2031, les mariages sacramentels seront une relique du passé. En 1950, la France comptait 50 000 prêtres ; aujourd'hui, ils ne sont plus que 10 000, la majorité d'entre eux étant d'un âge avancé. Il y a quelques semaines, le séminaire de Lille, qui accueillait les aspirants prêtres de tout le nord de la France, a temporairement fermé ses portes en raison du faible nombre d'inscriptions - seulement 10 étudiants pour l'année académique en cours. Selon les sombres prévisions de Fourquet, le tout dernier prêtre de France pourrait être ordonné dès 2044.

Selon Fourquet, ""Il y a un processus de déchristianisation croissante, qui conduit à la 'phase terminale' de la religion catholique, à moins qu'elle ne se camoufle avec des valeurs laïques anti-chrétiennes, ce qui est déjà le cas.""

Selon Fourquet, ""Il y a un processus de déchristianisation croissante, qui conduit à la 'phase terminale' de la religion catholique, à moins qu'elle ne se camoufle avec des valeurs laïques anti-chrétiennes, ce qui est déjà le cas.""

Le vaticaniste français Henry Ricq a évoqué ""l'angoisse de notre propre disparition"" dans son livre de 2018 La grande peur des catholiques, où l'auteur affirme ne même plus ""reconnaître l'Église"" - une Église difficile à trouver et que beaucoup de Français considèrent comme une Église ""de zombies.""

Fourquet évoque également le changement culturel provoqué par l'immigration musulmane (Mohammed était le prénom de bébé garçon le plus populaire en banlieue parisienne en 2017, et les projections de Pew Research estiment que le nombre de musulmans en France doublera d'ici 2050, pour arriver à 17,4 % de la population du pays) : ""Pendant des centaines d'années, la religion catholique a structuré la conscience collective des Français. La société d'aujourd'hui n'est plus que l'ombre de ce qu'elle était autrefois. Un grand changement de civilisation est en cours.""

Alors que les églises catholiques sont pleines de ""zombies"" âgés, ""les mosquées sont pleines de jeunes et leurs lieux de culte ne suffisent généralement pas pour l'ensemble de leurs communautés locales.""

Dans une interview sur son livre accordée au journal français Les Echos, Fourquet a expliqué que la déchristianisation, la perte d'influence des médias de masse, la montée continue de l'individualisme de masse et l'immigration qui ont modifié le profil démographique de la France sont quelques-uns des facteurs qui ont contribué à ""une fragmentation sans précédent de la société française. ... Ce sont des phénomènes profonds et il est difficile de lutter contre eux. Nous n'avons pas trouvé de matrice qui puisse jouer un rôle de ciment puissant.""

Selon l'analyste, le principal défi de cette nouvelle ère va être de trouver une matrice commune qui pourrait permettre de reformer des coalitions au sein de la société française.

Le livre de Fourquet a été lancé en même temps que plusieurs attaques contre des bâtiments religieux. Au début du mois, l'église historique de Saint-Sulpice a subi un incendie criminel.

En février, l'église Saint-Nicolas a signalé trois incidents de vandalisme en dix jours, dont l'un comprenait la destruction d'une statue de la Vierge Marie datant du XIXe siècle. Dans l'église Notre-Dame des Enfants de Nîmes, la police a trouvé des hosties consacrées dispersées dans les ordures et le dessin d'une croix faite avec des excréments humains sur le mur.

Des hosties sacrées ont également été volées et répandues dans l'église Notre-Dame de Dijon. Si tous ces faits ont eu lieu au cours des deux derniers mois, la profanation est persistante depuis un certain temps. En juillet 2018, l'église Saint-Pierre du Matroi à Orléans, par exemple, a été partiellement incendiée et ""Allahu Akbar"" avait été peint à la bombe sur les murs.

Mgr Georges Pontier, président de la conférence des évêques de France et archevêque de Marsiglia, a approuvé certains points de Fourquet : ""La société civile en France était autrefois organisée selon des références chrétiennes. Cette période est révolue. Nos sociétés sont désormais plurielles sur le plan religieux.""

Mais pour Pontier, cela ne signifie pas nécessairement la fin de l'Église dans le pays : ""L'aspect religieux est toujours présent. Les réflexions des groupes religieux existent et elles sont entendues dans le débat public.""

Concernant la récente vague d'attaques d'églises, il insiste sur le fait qu'elle est limitée à quelques personnes : ""Il y a quelques individus qui sont prêts à utiliser tous les moyens pour nuire à l'Église, mais ce n'est pas un phénomène prédominant. Nous ne sommes pas victimes de la 'cathophobie' \[telle que décrite par le politicien conservateur Éric Ciotti\].""

Pontier insiste également sur le fait que la foi catholique est florissante, mentionnant que son diocèse baptise des centaines d'adultes chaque année. En effet, cela semble être la seule tendance positive dans l'Église française, qui a connu une croissance de 40 % des baptêmes d'adultes au cours des dix dernières années.

"Today in 2007 the Church in Latin America came to age with the Aparecida conference - 6 years later its leader, Cardinal Bergoglio would be elected Pope Francis",TJB74,1622452574,"  

Today in 2007 the 5th conference of Latina American Bishops was closed by Pope Benedict XV. This was the meeting of the continents council (*Consejo Episcopal Latinoamericano*), better known as CELAM,

* Created in 1955 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Pius XII had encouraged the creation of CELAM as the first continent wide collegial-structure in the modern church. In 1955, the first conference, reflected the European identity and formation of many of the Bishops, and was described by the influential Uruguayan thinker Albert Methol Ferrer as a *mirror* conference. In that it reflected the theology that had been developed in European Centres which was less relevant to the realities of South and Central America. 
* However, this changed in 1968 with the second conference in Medellín, Colombia, following the global Second Vatican Council. Medellin adapted the fruits of Vatican 2 in a creative way to the Latin American context with a focus on the poor and oppressed in society. Successfully arguing that the presence of the Church must go *beyond* the promotion of personal holiness by preaching and the sacraments
* Todays  Fifth Conference held in Aparecida, which was opened by Benedict XVI on May 13 and ended today on May 31, 2007. The theme of the Fifth Conference was: ""Disciples and Missionaries of Jesus Christ so that our peoples may have life in Him,"" inspired by a passage from the Gospel of John, who narrates ""I am the Way, the Truth and the Life"" . The Latin American Catholic Church, had been learning a lot from the rapid growth of Pentecostalism in its huge megacities, particularly amongst the poor. The chall
* Recognised the power of the popular spirituality of  Our Lady of Aparecida where they were meeting, hearing the prayers and songs of the tens of thousands of pilgrims.  This allowed them to develop an authentic liberation theology that was rooted in the experience of the poor, *a teologia del pueblo.* 
* Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, an Argentinian Jesuit was elected by his brother bishops to chair the important committee charged with drafting the final document of Aparecida. Inspired by Pope Benedict’s encyclical, Deus Caritas Est ‘ *That being a Christian is not the result of an ethical choice or lofty idea, but the encounter with an event, a person, which gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction*”  Aparecida proposed a new model for the Church. Based on this encounter, leading to awe, then the decision to follow, would they felt provide authentic witnesses and lead to communal renewal. This encounter was especially powerful in the lives of the poor and the *pueblo fiel*, God’s holy faithful people. 
* Bergoglio would later be elected Pope Francis after Benedict’s shock resignation. Evangelli Gaudium, Pope Francis first encyclical, The Joy of the Gospel repeated the lessons they had learnt in Aparecida, but this time for the global church.

The spiritual Eros in Catholicism,Tamerovv,1622451337,"It seems that in modern times we only associate the word ""eros"" with sexual lust. But in old Christian mysticism, especially in Catholic monasticism, a purely spiritual eros has a long tradition. 

Agape is the love that gives, Eros is the love that desires. Many Catholic mystics thought that this ""desiring"" love can also serve the desire for God. Benedict XVI showed in his encyclical ""God is Love"" that erotic love and God’s plan are in profound cooperation. For him, agape and eros are not in conflict either, one flows from of the other. In early Christian and rabbinical literature, comments on the Song of Songs gave rise to the image of the marriage of Zion, the Church or individual soul with God or the Messiah, and in Catholicism, also often with the virgin Mary.

Bernhard of Clairvaux, the founder of the Cistercians, tried in his mysticism to transform the Minne, the courtly love, which was very popular in his time, into a Christian Minne. It shows the erotic relationship of the Cistercians to all areas of existence. A liberated eros, which is not based on any sexuality, but encompasses the whole human being, heaven and earth and so, in contrast to the sexual eros purifies the soul.",Catholicism

Does God want me to marry this Hindu girl?,aljugxc,1622447752,"Long Post:

Me and her recently had a serious talk about our future after I started thinking more seriously about my future.

I know the obvious answer to this question is probably no, and that I am ""blinded"" by my emotions, thats all possibly true, but hear me out. I've been dating this Hindu girl for nearly two years and its been great, we share similar values in life and have the same goal of getting married and starting a family, when it comes to morals and values, it is line with mine. The only difference is our supernatural faith, we both believe that there is ultimately one God, she just believes that that one God has different forms (thus the many Hindu gods). I understand why this could be a concern, but despite this our morals are the same, we are both practising celibacy until marriage, she is also willing to practise NFP. She is also happy to pray with in the Catholic way, understand and know my faith more, and come to church with me every Sunday and doesn't expect me to do the same for her, which I am very grateful for.

In regards to kids, she still wants them to practise the Hindu faith and thinks its unfair if they can only practise the catholic faith, I can understand this perspective. I can see how this may be a problem and this is one of the things I have to consider. Additionally, she is adamant on considering to convert, she says she is happy practising her faith and it is how she was brought up.  She also finds it offensive that I want to pray for her to convert as her religion is a part of her and it means that I don't love her fully, I don't how to explain otherwise.

Despite these reasons, there has been several instances where I feel that God has done wonders to help this relationship, I prayed about this relationship before dating her and asked God for his will to play out and that I'm ready to not date if thats what he wants, and apart from our supernatural faith being different, I saw no reason to not date her. I feel like God has helped both of us in this relationship in many instances, not by giving us what we want, but by letting things workout in a way that really guides us, I pray for us all the time and I know that God hears me. I just don't know if this is part of his plan and I have no idea what he wants me to do now. If I let her go, then its one beautiful soul and her offspring that I'm giving away from potentially receiving Christ one day. I have been praying so much and I don't know what to do.

I also can't imagine hurting her, I know that she loves me more than I can imagine and I am grateful that God gave me a woman like this in my life. She is far more emotional than I am and I know that it would break her and she wouldn't be the same, she is so innocent in everything she does and I can't bring myself to hurting her. Is is not selfish of me to date her for this long and then do that to her so that I can have an easier marriage?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I love a Hindu girl and we have the same morals, and I have always prayed about this relationship and I don't know what God wants me to do.",Catholicism

Worried about changing my life when i'm near the end,Informal-Amphibian-4,1622435107,"If we are judged by our deeds on earth then i 'm rightly worried about the state i'm in. Seeing how deeds in a state of sin bring no merit and how rarely it is that i'm in a state of grace i can see myself appearing before God like the servant who had made no return on his talents. As scripture says, ""even what he has shall be taken away."" I've done so little good in my life that i fear i'll have no choice but to show up empty-handed before Our Lord at the time of death.  I'll have nothing to show for my life which end i am nearing. 

All my years on earth seem to be a foul, wasted dungheap. Instead of building the kingdom of God in my heart or on earth, i've left a trail of destruction everywhere i've gone, in everything i've done, in every relationship i've had. I have not lived up to my vocation whatever it is or my state in life. I've abandoned and escaped every cross and suffering i could in my life. Not only that. I've been a cross and burden and penance for everyone else. I've burned every bridge that's been extended to me. I've been given many gifts and talents and i don't say that to be conceited but only in recognizing how much i've been given compared to how much i've used for his glory. There have been times here and there when i've done something that could have been ""good"" but those are so minor and so few and far between that they feel too little to add up to anything real. It feels like there is very little actual virtue in me. Any good i've done still sits against the backdrop of my dissoluteness.

She was also really verbally abusive and mean to me. She allowed my brother to sell drugs and guns in our house. His skethcy gang member friends came at all hours of the night and it made me nervous and paranoid 

I was afraid that our house would get shot up. I got fed up with the way she treated me and defended him. It infuriated me how i worked full time with little to no time for school and she continued to treat me bad and favor him in spite of his actions. My brothers and I got into a huge fight and they beat me u o pretty bad because I cant fight too well..being that I never learned because I never lived a lifestyle where I was confronted with violence.
I ocasionally get very anger and I heat up with a murderous rage. I am very angry and upset and bitter..but its eating me up inside and blinding my soul from God's grace. This bitterness is like a cancer..its turning me into a hideous monster and i hate it..but i am just so angry. After years of abuse, put downs, violence, disappointment and just general problems I am still very angry and bitter..I don't want to be this way.

But I don’t feel connected to some Catholic spiritual practices. I think I’m feeling spiritually dry right now. Sometimes it feels to me like I want to engage in something mystical, something grand. But yet I also feel like I’m trying to reach for something that I can’t grasp. Perhaps it’s God. 

Does anyone else ever feel like God is near, but when you try to come close, God makes Himself further? Or maybe He makes you feel like you need to do something else?

I’m not feeling drawn to Catholic spiritual practices, like liturgy of the hours, I’m not feeling up to praying the Rosary, I’m not feeling up to these things because I want to worship God in a different way...like something quiet and mystical. What if my whole approach isn’t right for me? What if I need to go about my Catholic spiritual journey a different way?  I want to try out different things and see what sticks. Perhaps something unusual or different. The standard forms of prayers don’t feel connecting to me anymore. 

I think I want to connect to God through love and compassion, but I need some guidance and help where to begin. I feel like going off the beaten path in my love for God. To forge a way that is interesting, but the problem is...I’m not sure what I’m even trying to reach for. 

I’m confused. I know I need to go somewhere but I don’t know to get there? 

I wonder if maybe I needn’t do anything at all except stand still and let God take me? Maybe the issue is that I am trying to forge a path when God wants to instead forge a path for me, so as a result, I’m confused??

But a part of me is resistant to just doing nothing. But I think God wants me to do nothing and wait...

Should women be forbidden to be a priest?,Leading-Reporter-848,1622427569,"Some churches such as Anglican church permits a woman to be a priest whereas most churches such as Catholic church don't. However I wonder is there is a valid reason to forbid it. why not? I wonder what's the logic behind it.

&gt;Catholic church does not have a right to ordain a woman because it does not know if it is okay or not, since no apostle was a woman.

As far as I know, this is the official explanation of Catholic church. But it brings me questions :

1. No apostle was proven to be either black, or disabled, or a former soldier, or fat, or a landlord. But we all agree that such people can also be priests even though none of apostles were not found to be such people. Why is it wrong to put 'or a woman' in the list above?

2. Apparently the best apostle who even recieved the key to the heaven was Peter, who had a wife. and other figures in the early church. If only the ones who have the same backgrounds as apostles can be priests, what makes it right for Catholic church to forbid male priests to marry?

This is what the holy bible says:

&gt;3 This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. 4 Don’t we have the right to food and drink? 5 Don’t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas? 1 Corinthians 9:3\~9:5

Seems like even the bible questions it...

3. Catholic church actually 'changed' requirements for being a priest. Why can't it change it agian?

Clerical celibacy was never a requirement in the early church but Catholic church 'decided' to forbid it in 4th century, which was hundreds of years the holy church was built by our lord.

&gt;Synod of Elvira (c. 305)
(Canon 33): ""It is decided that marriage be altogether prohibited to bishops, priests, and deacons, or to all clerics placed in the ministry, and that they keep away from their wives and not beget children; whoever does this shall be deprived of the honor of the clerical office.""

So basically the Catholic church could change the requirements for being a priest in the past and Apparently most of us(Catholic believers) agree with the idea that priests should not have a wife.

Would there be a great explanation why women should be forbidden to be a priest? Please give ideas. Thanks!",Catholicism

Questions about Eastern Catholicism,consideringcatholic,1622424541,"I’m a Protestant who is looking into Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. At this point my two big hesitations regarding becoming Catholic over Orthodox are the Augustinian view of original sin, and relatedly the immaculate conception, and the supreme ecclesiastical authority of the Pope over every part of the Church. However I’ve been curious as to how Eastern Catholicism relates to these topics.

So my first question is are Eastern Catholics required to adhere to the Augustinian view of original sin or are they permitted to adhere to the traditional Eastern Orthodox view of “ancestral sin” and have more of a view that we are not born with original sin but are born with an innate tendency to sin? Is this something eastern Catholics are allowed to believe since it’s the Eastern Orthodox view? Also, since under that framing the immaculate conception doesn’t make any sense are eastern Catholics, assuming they can believe in the eastern view, allowed to view the immaculate conception as being required only under the western framework of viewing sin and not have to believe in it under the eastern framework of sin? I read somewhere that these views aren’t necessarily contradictory but just different ways of framing something. Is this an acceptable way of seeing those two viewpoints under Catholicism and if it is would that mean that you can adhere to the eastern framework and not include the immaculate conception in that framework while being a non heretical eastern Catholic? 

My second question is how much power does the Pope have over the eastern Catholic Church? Can the Pope just remove an Eastern Bishop for whatever reason like he can for a western bishop? Does he have the same powers over a random member of the laity of an eastern Catholic parish as he would over a member of a parish in the western rite? Are the rules for the Popes authority in the eastern Church different from the rules for the Popes authority in the western church?",Catholicism

My son served his first TLM today and I just wanted to share!,passive_periphrastik,1622413771,"I posted this on FB and Instagram and wanted to share here too.

I don’t normally make these types of posts, but this is something I am incredibly proud to share. As Catholics, we call our public worship a “liturgy” (λειτουργία) which etymological means, a public duty or service, typically to the state, undertaken by the public or citizen. Early Christians adopted the term to mean the official public service of the Church. So liturgy can be taken to mean the work of the people. It is a moment where man takes the fruit of his labor and brings it back to his Creator in an act of worship. Today, on the Feast of the Most Holy Trinity, my son was able to take a more meaningful part of this public worship by serving in his first Mass. 

What made it even more beautiful is that this was a liturgy, almost a decade in the making. Almost nine years ago, I made a vow before God and neighbor to enter into Holy Matrimony with my beautiful wife. Our Mass was a nuptial Mass according to the 1962 missal. Sitting in choro was a great friend and current seminarian at the time, who was a witness to my new vocation. A year later, my wife and I welcomed our first child, into this world. On this day six years ago, I was privileged to attend the priestly ordination of Fr. R where I now had the joy of seeing his new vocation. He has been a blessing to my family in countless ways, and I thank God for his friendship and priestly ministry he has shown my family. 

Today, our vocations were brought together in that my son assisted Fr. R, on the anniversary of his priestly ordination, to bring about the liturgical function of adoration, atonement, thanksgiving, and petition in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. I could not be more proud as a father, and I will cherish this memory forever.",Catholicism

*According to the papal biographer Austen Ivereigh, the prime minister’s two previous marriages were unlikely to have been recognised in Catholic law, as his former spouses were not Catholic, nor were the weddings Catholic ceremonies. Therefore, a “simple administrative process” was likely to have been used to declare the previous marriages invalid.*

*He wrote on Twitter: “Boris’s two previous marriages (probably) lacked canonical form, that is, are not recognised in Catholic law. So he (probably) didn’t need an annulment.

Finally went to mass for the first time today. I was in tears throughout the entire service. Just wanting to share my story.,Landmarks2011,1622410382,"Good day, I hope you are all at peace today. I want to share my story.

My parents have been non-practicing non-denominational throughout my entire life. Christianity had intimidated me for some time as I typically associated it with the apocalypse and other unpleasant things to think about. In my last two years of high school, I had become drawn to the church through social media outlets/memes. I think you can see where this is going. I would always come up with some sort of excuse instead of actually going. I projected my 'faith' outwards without actually practicing. I would judge others and be prideful of how I was following God's way, despite, again - not actually practicing it.

Throughout the pandemic, I bid my time with distractions. I continued to delude myself with these distractions and my life began to drift for months. I felt very lost. For the longest time, I've been struggling to know who I am and what I want. I had no drive to correct myself.

Eventually, I had stumbled into an article describing the physical suffering of Jesus. When I read the article, I felt a heavy guilt overcome me. I read more and more into Christ's sacrifice and the fact he did it for a sinner like me was truly moving. Even then, I still drifted. I continued to give into my pleasures and drive myself further and further into sin. 

I think what finally started the turnaround was the hardship of losing my childhood dog. She was 12 years old and I thought I at least had two more years with her. Unfortunately, she began to develop a tumor on one of her mammary glands that continued to double in size without stopping. I didn't know what to do. Most nights I would pray a prayer with the intercession of St. Francis of Assisi that she would get better. Eventually we scheduled a surgery to remove the tumor. I was very nervous as I was told there was a high chance she might not wake up. On the day of the surgery, I spent every hour from the moment we left the vet office praying to the Lord that she would wake up. When I had received the good news, I was overcome with joy. I never felt such genuine happiness in my life. That was the moment in my eyes that confirmed to me that God was real. Following that, I finally gathered my courage and signed up for the RCIA program near a local parish. I then spent the next two weeks caring for her in her recovery from the surgery. Then came the real hardship. The tumor eventually came back, and we had already spent over $1,000 on the surgery.
I knew what came next. I had a hard time trying to cope with it. I felt so guilty and ashamed towards myself. The distractions I spoke of earlier had nothing to do with my dog. Most days, the only interaction I would have with her would be fulfilling my responsibilities such as feeding her and taking her outside. Even then I would selfishly skip those responsibilities. I distracted myself because I thought I had more time with her. The guilt was crushing to me. Throughout the last week I had with her, you could not separate me from her. Which, in turn, multiplied my guilt. The happy, innocent smile that I had known for so long was gone. Her breathing was heavy and it became harder and harder for her to walk as the tumor continued to grow in size. She would lick her bed nonstop for minutes at a time. Those days felt like weeks to me. Here I am, watching one of the greatest parts of my childhood slowly drift away in pain. I never felt so powerless in my life. I was just counting the days till the moment we had to put her down. My mind was too distracted to turn to God. Looking back on it now, I think that was because I had nothing to beg him for. There was no stopping this. Eventually, I grew tired of this whole episode of guilty and shame. I just wanted it to be done and over with. I couldn't stay in that state of mind forever.

Two weeks after she was put down, I went to my very first RCIA meeting. I was joined by two other people, both of whom were former Catholics wanting to reaffirm their faith. While I was the only convert there, I felt a warming, welcoming presence. They wanted me to go to mass the following Sunday. Following that meeting, my whole nature of prayer changed. No longer was I looking to God for something in return. I turned to God for comfort. I prayed that I would be set on the right path. I was genuinely excited for And yet... I fell into temptation. I will admit that I, like many other men my age unfortunately do, suffer from a porn addiction. Following my sinful acts, I never felt so empty and alone. I truly missed that feeling I had before. Instead of choosing to despair like my old self, I went to action. Despite not understanding it fully, I prayed the Sorrowful Mysteries. I pleaded with God, telling him I don't want to lead the sinful life that I've been living. In a deep prayer, I felt the presence from before return. However, the presence I felt was more firm and serious. In that moment I understood the seriousness of God's love. If I truly wanted to live a life devoid of sin, I would need to build some serious discipline. Each day following that day I prayed the Rosary along with prayers for my chastity.

Then today came.

I was so excited. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect. This would be my first church experience ever. I don't think I've ever felt so welcomed and comfortable around people that I've never met before. And I don't know why, but I just can't keep myself from tearing up when it comes to faith. Sure, I would cry during prayer, and I'd be able to gather my composure. But in church, that was a different story. From the moment I stepped into the church, I was practically fighting to keep myself from bawling mid-service. I didn't feel any of the guilt or shame that plagued me before. I felt at peace. I don't understand how people can just simply skip mass. It is truly a wonderful thing that I will cherish for many years to come.

After I came home, I felt motivated to purge out and cast away what led me astray before. Deleting this collection was something I've always been hesitant to do, and it would come up in my mind almost every time during prayer. Like before, I was hesitant with this thought. But I was determined. I was ready to cast away my old, lost self and take control of my willpower. In that moment, I permanently deleted my years old collection of assorted pornography. When I saw that it was gone forever, I didn't feel remorse or regret. In fact, I celebrated. I celebrated that I finally did it. Of course, this doesn't mean I am safe from pornography forever, but I felt like I made a huge step today. If you have any resources to help me maintain my abstinence, please share. I would be delighted to read them.

Everyone of good will should take a moment to honour the lives of the 215 children who's graves were found at residential schools in Canada this weekend,Anglicanpolitics123,1622409372,"For those who do not know, the residential school system was a system put in place in Canada starting under its first Prime Minister John A Macdonald with the Indian Act in the 1870s. The goal was to forcibly remove children from their parents and ""civilise"" them by ""beating the Indian"" out of them. They were forbidden from speaking their native tongue. If they would face corporal punishment such as beatings by adminstrators, priests, nuns and Christian ministers. Often times they endured sexual abuse at the hands of religious clergy as well as religious abuse whether it was beatings, tying children to chairs where they would experience electric shock for using their native language and other horrid practises. In addition, because of lack of maintenance the life expectancy at these schools were very low with high risks of mortality from disease and poor conditions.

Over the span of the schools existences over 150,000 children were forcibly taken by their parents and 6000 died. It is an act of cultural genocide. I'm bringing this all up because the graves of 215 children who died in residential schools was just discovered this weekend in British Columbia, Canada. I further bring this up because it was Christian institutions that ran these schools. The Canadian government started the policy, but because of the fact that there was a separation of jurisdiction between Federal and Provincial government where the Provinces have control of education, the Federal government had to find a way to operate these schools in so called constitutional limits. That's where they got the idea to outsource this to the Churches. So the Churches, carrying out a government policy, ended up all becoming complicit in this crime. From all denominations. The Catholic Church ran 60% of the schools. The Anglican Church(my Church) ran 30% of the schools. United and other Protestant Churches ran 10% of the schools. They were not only doing this in the name of government policy but in the name of Christ and allegedly ""spreading the Gospel"". For Indigenous children their encounter with the Gospel was forced removals from their families, beatings, sexual abuse, electrocutions, and deaths. Right now in Canada we have the flags in all our cities half mast in honour of the lives of these children found at the Catholic residential schools in B.C but there are multiple other graves as yet to be discovered.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in part requires Churches from across the board to engage in the process of justice which include things ranging from compensation to even a systematic overhaul of how seminary education is done to include curriculums that speak about justice for the indigenous community. Pope is also required by call to action 58 of the TRC to come to Canada and apologise to the victims to Catholic residential school for what happened. The Canadian Catholic bishops issued statements acknowledging the crimes that took place in 1991 and Pope Benedict XVI issued a statement of ""sorrow"" in Rome in 2009 but victims of Catholic residential school(who are Catholic themselves) want more. They would like to see Pope Francis journey to Canada, visit the graves of residential school victims and apologise to survivors in person. Expanding this even more the Canadian residential school system was formulated by the Davin Report, a Parliamentary report based on American Native American boarding schools, which was another system of abuse that lasted from the 1860s and 70s under Reconstruction presidents Ulysses S Grant and Rutherford B Hayes to 1973 when President Richard Nixon formally ended them",Catholicism

But I don’t know exactly where this quote would be found.  And I don’t want to keep repeating it unless I know where it comes from, since I want to be accurate.

The Church and Therapy,11100010100,1622396639,"What role does therapy have within the Catholic vision of society? Originally in the early church and the middle ages there was no such thing as organized therapy as we have now. At most there was confession which was the only examination of the interior life of man- albeit limited only to sin and not preference and not psychological disorders.

In 1953, Pius XII both gave moral direction while implying the usefulness of psychiatry in [his address](https://nacn-usa.org/wp-content/uploads/Pius-XII-1953-Psychotherapy-and-Psychology-Address.pdf) to the  Fifth International Congress on Psychotherapy and Clinical Psychology. Vatican II's Gaudium et Spes  [§5](https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html) went further and mentioned, ""Advances in biology, *psychology*, and the social sciences not only bring men hope of improved self-knowledge..."" which became more clear in 1993 when John Paul II in [an address](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1993/january/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19930104_psychiatric-association.html) American Psychiatric Association mentioned, "" The task of healing others and ensuring their psycho–social equilibrium is indeed important and delicate.""

However, therapy whether family therapy, marriage therapy, counseling, or psychiatry cannot be reduced to an overwhelming positive. Due to the amoral increase of psychiatry under the influence of an amoral liberalism which encouraged unrepressing certain desires,and the influence of Adler, Jung, and Freud it led to Bishop [Fulton J.

"It's that day again... Trinity Sunday... and so, Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith. Which faith unless every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. And the catholic faith is this:",TexanLoneStar,1622393085,"That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Essence. For there is one Person of the Father; another of the Son; and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one; the Glory equal, the Majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is; such is the Son; and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreated; the Son uncreated; and the Holy Ghost uncreated. The Father unlimited; the Son unlimited; and the Holy Ghost unlimited. The Father eternal; the Son eternal; and the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet they are not three eternals; but one eternal. As also there are not three uncreated; nor three infinites, but one uncreated; and one infinite. So likewise the Father is Almighty; the Son Almighty; and the Holy Ghost Almighty. And yet they are not three Almighties; but one Almighty. So the Father is God; the Son is God; and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not three Gods; but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord; the Son Lord; and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not three Lords; but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity; to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord; So are we forbidden by the catholic religion; to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords. The Father is made of none; neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created; but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten; but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is before, or after another; none is greater, or less than another. But the whole three Persons are coeternal, and coequal. So that in all things, as aforesaid; the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped. He therefore that will be saved, let him thus think of the Trinity.

Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation; that he also believe faithfully the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess; that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man; God, of the Substance [Essence] of the Father; begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the Substance [Essence] of his Mother, born in the world. Perfect God; and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood. Who although he is God and Man; yet he is not two, but one Christ. One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by assumption of the Manhood into God. One altogether; not by confusion of Substance [Essence]; but by unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one Christ; Who suffered for our salvation; descended into hell; rose again the third day from the dead. He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from whence he will come to judge the living and the dead. At whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies; And shall give account for their own works. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire. This is the catholic faith; which except a man believe truly and firmly, he cannot be saved.",Catholicism
I saw someone almost die today,Franco-Americain,1622391660,"Today I witnessed a man fall and hit his head on the ice. After the impact, he wasn't moving and soon after I saw a pool of blood form by his head. There was nothing I could do except pray as the proper people attended to him, first rink workers and then EMTs. We were told to get off the ice. Off the ice, I prayed, the Hail Mary, the Our Father, in English and in Latin, out loud but quietly. I prayed many times. I wish I had a rosary and knew how to use it. We were told his injury was not as serious as I thought. By the time I left the rink, he was up and walking.

I don't know if my prayers saved him but I know God answers prayers. I thank God I was there to pray and to be a witness for the faith.

I have been reading the Acts of the Apostles and a passage comes to mind:

""There were many lamps burning in the upper room where we had met; and a young man called Eutychus, who was sitting in the embrasure of the window, was overcome by deep sleep. As Paul still went on preaching, sleep weighed him down, and he fell from the third storey to the ground, where he was taken up dead. Paul went down, bent over him, and embraced him; then he said, Do not disturb yourselves; his life is yet in him. And so he went up again and broke bread and ate; afterwards he talked with them for some time until dawn came, when he left. And the boy was taken home alive, to their great comfort."" - 20:8-12",Catholicism
Question about rosary,Slack_Liner_,1622391555,"I am agnostic, but I grew up in an evangelical home. Looking over prayers of the rosary, some questions arose. 

I'm assuming that these words do not mean what I think they do, so I am asking for clarification. But, in the Salve Regina there are phrases ascribed to Mary such as her being ""our hope"" and ""our life"". From what I can remember when I was a Christian, Jesus is supposed to be our hope and life. How can these words be said of Mary without being heretical? 

Moreover, when Catholics are pressed with the protestant objection of praying *to* Mary, they often reply that they merely ask Mary to pray for them. This seems accurate in the case of the Hail Mary. However, I am aware that there is a 54 Day Rosary Novena where one can ask Mary for something. This seems to go beyond merely asking Mary to pray for oneself. It almost appears that one is petitioning Mary in the same way they would ask something of God. Can you explain this to me?

Where is the best place to evangelize?,DubzBreezy,1622391310,"I've recently come to the faith and have been studying apologetics. I really want to spread the faith through evangelization, and am curious what you all think the best avenue for this is.

Bad relationship with confession.,anonreddit_,1622386386,"I feel like I have a bad relationship with confession and self loathing. Guess it's been like this since 2016 (2nd half freshmen year of college) . Whenever I tried to stop porn. Before then never really tried to stop and only went to confession when parents forced me. 

I fall, I get upset with myself (though sometimes not until day after). I belittle myself, beat myself up, call myself worthless. Completely give up on praying until I goto confession. It feels like can't live with myself. Struggle to combat this line of thinking ""Already screwed up so what's the point. Might as well get more in."" and go off binging.  When things are going well I'm fine. As soon as I screw up the hurricane of emotions come. I think sometimes ""Don't I deserve hell for everything I've done? Why not just accept I'm going to hell. That's ultimate justice. I could get it over with now."" Then I'll start to reject religion, ""Why do I follow something that makes me hate myself and makes me ashame of my desires?""

Rosary Testimony: I've been receiving Signal Graces during Mass for 2 weeks now,Brilliant-Wafer-188,1622384681,"So I was in a pretty horrible situation for a while now (the lowest point in my life), and when it was when I was in the greatest depths that I started to pray the rosary 5 times a day (Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious, and  Luminous mysteries in addition to the one I was already doing for the 54-day novena). I had heard that the 15 promises of the rosary takes effect if you pray all 4 rosaries daily, and I really was desperate for a miracle. This was around 3 weeks ago.

I had been consistently asking the Blessed Mother to please pray that the Holy Spirit help an abusive co-worker to be nicer (because this certain person was negatively affecting me and others). This person had started getting abusive around 2 months ago, and has never been nice since.

Just before Mass last week, I was starting to think about what I can do to help change this person: *Should I do overtime? Should I agree with whatever she says? What could I do?*

The Mass started, and as the priest was discussing during the Homily, he said, **""You do not have the power to change a person. Only the Holy Spirit can.""** It blew me away. It's as if God were telling me to chill, sit back and relax, and let Him do His thing.

So I did.

A few days after that, we had the dreaded meeting with the abusive co-worker. My friends at work and I were talking about how scared we were and how we were just going to get roasted. We got to the meeting and she was laughing and making jokes. She was still saying some mean stuff here and there, but she was the nicest she's been in *months*. We were so stunned, we didn't know what to do. Afterwards, I thanked the Blessed Mother for interceding for me and the Holy Trinity for granting my prayers. It was a literal miracle.

\---------------------------------------------------

A much subtle signal grace story from today:

Yesterday, I felt a tugging to re-watch 'The Prince of Egypt' for some reason. It was great and I loved it so much (I didn't remember much of the plot before re-watching because I last watched it as a kid). Before going to sleep, I prayed and told God how much I enjoyed the film and thanked Him for the experience.

Today during Mass, the first reading was about Moses reminding the Israelites of everything God did for them in Egypt. The priest expounded a bit by recounting what had happened and how God freed His people...which is pretty much the plot of the movie. At that moment, I felt like He was telling me, **""I hear all your prayers, even the silliest ones. I'm always listening. I'm always here for you.""**

I was so amazed I just had to laugh.

\---------------------------------------------------

I honestly just felt a great need to write this down just in case anyone needed to read something like this today. I was at the lowest point in my life, and I felt like the Lord wanted me to get to know His mom through the Rosary...and Our Lady took my hand and has been leading me closer to Jesus.

So pray your Rosaries! It really is a wonderful gift and I will always recommend it to anyone who's having a hard time.",Catholicism

What translation(s) have the Catholic Church traditionally used?,Honeybeard,1622382777,"I've just been watching this TikTok by a protestant Pastor who was calling out why using the KJV wasn't ideal, in it she mentioned:

&amp;#x200B;

* The King censored it: he would traditionally ask translators to shy away from giving the people of the church power, and any instead give that power to the Church clergy and institution. So any mention of the church community was often purposefully mistranslated to The Church.
* The translators at the time didn't fully understand Greek because they didn't have access to later manuscripts which would help translate Greek. So for example, it mistranslated Oxen for Unicorns, or the end of an age to the end of the world.

There are more examples. This then got me to thinking about an older church institution - the Catholic Church. How would they have translated it? Who translated it? When was it (re)translated? How much of the knowledge was from exegesis and was from knowledge passed down a (at the time) millenium long institution?

I was trying to work out my own life expectancy when I stumbled across this great little online tool, [The Death Clock](https://www.death-clock.org/). Just input your basic details along with your Body Mass Index (BMI) along with your vice/s and it gives you a prediction based on the statistical likelihood of your death date.


To work out your BMI just take your weight in kgs and divide it by your height in metres squared. As an example I am 14 stone, I Googled this weight in kgs to roughly 88kgs, then I took my height of 1.8 metres and squared it, which just means multiplied by itself. 1.8 x 1.8 = 3.24 so using the formula above I take 88 and divide it by 3.24 to give my BMI as 27.


Of course there are other factors to consider outside of our own control but it's amusing to see the actual date pop up. Apparently I am expected to live to 88, thats 45 years from now which would be in the 2160's sometime. 


There's something a bit unnerving about looking past that date, 2170's I would be 90, very likely dead, 2180's into 100+ and statistically *very* unlikely to be alive. 2190's and most certainly dead and buried.

My solution to fighting pornography temptation by way of St Padre Pio,Ringpaw1996,1622372627,"One of St Padre Pio's famous quotes is this: Pray, Hope, And don't worry.

How does this relate to fighting one of the most prevailing moral epidemics of our time?  Let me tell you.

Many people know that temptation cannot force the free will. All it does is aggrevate the flesh in a fight against the soul.

So the way it must be fought is this.   Psalm 46:10

Be still and know I am God.

Now this is a seemingly controversial take.
Because the solution to the temptation is to NOT ENGAGE.

and that can be terrifying.

Because inside we feel the tension from our flesh fighting our soul.
 And we want to act. We want to feel like we have control over the situations.   

This feeling of a need for control is false because the moment we engage in the thought to fight the temptation, it starts trying to allure us with mental images.

So we have to learn to Trust God and sit back. Give Him the reigns. 

PRAY
Fill our conscious thoughts with vocal prayer. This will help us  keep our focus on what God will do and not on the lurking temptation.  Make an act of faith....   pray the rosary. Anything that keeps.you mindful of God's Glorious presence.


HOPE
(expecting that God will be our stregth in our weakness)  This divine virtue  not the short term fleeting emotion. This is what will enable us to trust that God will fight this battle.  How do we know God will show?  Because God is glorified when He uses His strength to over come our weakness. And that allows us to praise and glorify Him even more.



DONT WORRY

This is definitely the toughest.  We have to trust God enough not to worry. And when we feel out of control this can be super difficult. This works with the virtue of hope.
Like I said before  if we worry then we will be tempted to take back control. And to do that will inevitably lead us to defeat. So as best you can  continue to do what you do on an ordinary day.  To not worry is to not expend extra mental or physical energy  on fighting this temptation by ourselves.  Keep moving with your next task in life whether at work  or at home or wherever.

And before you know it  the temptation will pass.   Yes the feeling of tug of war by our flesh against our soul sucks badly. It's almost feels like a physical sensation.  But God can do this.   It takes humility to do this.  
I recognize on a daily basis because of this temptation how weak I am.

I cant to it. So I trust that God will  because He loves me and wants to draw me closer to Him through these ordeals.

And He wishes the same for you.  

I hope this helps all of you whoever you are.

This has happened more than I wish it would, and though I continue to get up, go to confession, and come back to God, I can't wrap my head around why this is so hard to stop. I wish I could blame alcohol, her being flirtatious, me being newly converted. But the hard and solid truth is that I'm the sole culprit to these events, and if I tried a little harder I would not have been in these situations.  


Of course I'm trying not to be too hard on myself, but at some point you have to get a hold of yourself and be a little up-front.  


I guess what I'm asking is if anyone has been in a similar position before, if you have any advice.",Catholicism

National catholicism problem within spanish church(,1camila1,1622367619,"te rise of the far-right in Spanish clergy. Especially in the leanings of national catholicism. And there has been supporting within the clergy  , of organizations abuse of legal actions to discriminate against others , and  political parties with far right leanings

I will address the political parties case because is longer. Basically, there has been supportive of a far-right party called Vox within the clergy. Wich leans more into the alt-right, and the message is an ultra nationalist government. With a focus on language unity, minimize economic intervention, eliminate public healthcare, eliminate public funding of charities goes against the political party ideals, harsher immigration policies but also openly defending racism. On top of that denial of domestic abuse and ignorance regarding medical cases especially on women

Within this group there have been rallies going into areas to provoke,  make ads making false assumptions especially regarding immigration youth, insulting people who speak a language different than Spanish, and a long list. I just feel this kind of political party should stay away from the clergy as they show a different message of what christ and other people defend.

The issue comes that this nationalism is a thing rather to create a theocracy to keep the poor excluded. And make the rich richer, on top of making lower class people have a harder time getting into education. And forcing young men to enter the army, as they defend military service. 

Also, they want to eliminate public healthcare, and all show the dictatorship of Franco in a negative light.

I just feel that there should be a harsher criticism within Catholic communities, of how the clergy in Spain , is selling out to people like these political groups and catholic nationalism. Because intolerance will always have consequences one day , and if people join together it would be fixed easier to make intolerance disappear.

I would love to see perspectivie within catholic people , regarding this case and issue",Catholicism

Steiner and Anthroposophy. Christian? Demonic? And what about Tomberg?,Tamerovv,1622359312,"
I had a phase in which I dealt a lot with the esoteric, especially with anthroposophy. In the long run, however, I noticed that this couldn't help my spiritual thirst. Then, when I was able to perceive the truth of the gospel, some of that unhealthy interest died away. But it was not completely extinguished, and even if I now saw Rudolf Steiner with a different, critical eye, I still read some anthroposophical writings and they even gave me interest in many Christian mystics. Now I was unsure whether this influence was good for me or what was being preached there is actually Christian spirituality. 

On Reddit, under my post about Vladimir Solovyov, the user Kurumi Nakano recommended the ""Catholic hermetic"" Valentin Tomberg to me and he immediately won my interest. I found out that he was at first interested in the tarot and that he was enthusiastic about Rudolf Steiner's writings already at an early age. After the October Revolution he fled to Tallinn in Estonia, where he worked for the Tallinn branch of the Anthroposophical Society. In 1943 Tomberg converted to the Orthodox and in 1945 to the Roman Catholic Church, and was immediately expelled from the Anthroposophical Society. 

With his later writings that are no longer shaped only by anthroposophy, but aso a deeply felt Christology, Tomberg stood in the long tradition of the Christian church fathers and mystics, French and Russian hermetics, Jewish Kabbalah and those contemporary thinkers who tried to break through the boundaries of the scientific-materialist worldview. Tomberg, however, did not limit himself to simply summarizing traditions in a recapitulation, but enriched them with new insights. In the 1960s, He wrote his last work ""Méditations sur les 22 arcanes majeurs du Tarot"" which - according to his will - was only to appear after his death and under a pseudonym. It is a meditative introduction, a summa of Christian hermetics.

Question on plenary indulgences,Scottorum,1622358547,"I was seeking an answer to a question I had regarding plenary indulgences and I found this said in a different thread:

* ""Confession+ plenary indulgence= heaven

* confession+ partial indulgence= purgatory

* confession= purgatory

* no confession= purgatory or hell depending on whether or not sins were mortal""

My question is regarding the first (""confession + plenary indulgence = heaven"") is if one were to die immediately after receiving confession, say unexpectedly not just on their deathbed, and having done the plenary indulgence such as confession itself, receiving Holy Communion, praying for the Pope's intentions, and having a complete rejection of the desire to commit any sin, would that person die in a state of grace and go immediately to heaven? Also related, if we do a plenary indulgence such as any of the previous mentioned, does that cover the remission of all temporal punishment for sin or just a few, or in other words, are we to do regular plenary indulgences to make up for the temporal punishment for *all* sins that we've already confessed thus, if we were to die unexpectedly would Purgatory still be necessary?

The folks come from all over the world and all walks of life and al religions and beliefs.  

The experiences are 90%+ positive with some distressing NDEs that I try to avoid reading about.  Lol.  

However, the NDEs are all over the map in terms of who the Creator is, our mission, justice, morality, and self-perception.  All over the place. Many do see Jesus, though.

Included are some Catholics who come back and say basically we get wrapped around the axle when it comes to religious rules.  God seems more chill and laidback and just wants us “to love the one you’re with” like the CSN song says. 

Then there are ones that turn your hair white because these distressing NDEs are kind of straight out of Catholic Dogma and many cannot attain those strict standards.

Freedom from the Law - Excerpt from Theology of the Body for Beginners by Christopher West,feb914,1622339094," Most people look at Christian morality - especially sexual morality - as an oppressive list of rules to follow. How far this misunderstanding is from the ""living morality"" proclaimed by Christ! The Gospel doesn't give us more rules to follow. **The Gospel is meant to change our hearts so that we no longer need the rules** (see CCC 1968). To the degree that we experience this change of heart, we experience ""freedom from the law"" (see Romans 7; Galatians 5) - not freedom to break the law; freedom to fulfill it.

Here is an example of what freedom from the law looks like: Do you have any desire to murder your best friend? This may seem like an odd question, but it actually demonstrates the point. Assuming you do not, then you do not need the commandment ""Thou shalt not murder thy best friend"" because you have no desire to break it. To this extent you are ""free from the law"". In other words, you do not experience this law (""Thou shalt not murder thy best friend"") as an imposition because your heart already conforms to it.

Before sin, human heart conformed totally to God's will... Only with ""flat-tire syndrome"" do we experience the rupture between our desires and God's will for us. Here is where the law serves its essential purpose. It is given to convict us of sin (see Romans 7:7).

However when Christ says ""You have heard the commandment ... but I tell you ..."" he indicates that we need something more than mere precepts can offer.

The Old Testament law is good and just, but it ""does not of itself give the strength, the grace of the Spirit to fulfill it"" (CCC 1963)

**To the degree that we allow Christ to ""re-inflate our tires,"" we no longer need the law because we no longer desire to break it.** What laws do you still need? What teachings of the Church feel like a burden or imposition to you? Perhaps the problem is not with the law or with the Church, but with your own ""hardness of heart"". Don't throw away the law; surrender your disordered desires to Christ and let him transform them.

Trying to follow all the rules without seeking air for our flat tires is futile. Those who do will either become self-righteous hypocrites or they will abandon God's law for a rationalized watered-down version of the Gospel. Either way it is a ""gospel"" without good news; it is Christianity without Christ. **Both the self-righteous and the lawless have yet to ""pass-over"" from the bondage of the ethical code to the freedom of the ""new ethos"" - the freedom of redemption.**

Such freedom liberates us not from external ""constraint"" that calls us to good, but from the internal constraint that hinders our choice of the good. **When we desire what is true, good, and beautiful then we are free** indeed - free to love, free to bless, which is the freedom from the compulsion to grasp and possess. Those who toss off the law in order to indulge their lusts may imagine themselves free, but like an alcoholic who cannot say no to the bottle, a person who cannot say ""no"" to lust is enslaved. ""For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery"" (Galatians 5:1)",Catholicism

Struggling with faith,schoolandscrubs,1622335745,"I’m going to ramble here. TLDR is I’m struggling with my faith and want advice on what has helped to build your faith. Long version is I grew up Catholic, then switched to LDS where I’d honestly never been happier or more full of faith, then I found out that was all lies. I came back to my Catholic roots and began reading the bible again, going to church every Sunday, surrounding myself with the church (podcasts, youtube, etc). 
However... I am just struggling lately. If mormonism could all be lies when I believed so deeply in that, couldn’t this be too? Aren’t there so many religions and this is just another kind? I am part of an ExMormon support page where they sometimes post things like “how did I ever believe in a God who helped wiped out hundreds of thousands of people who didn’t believe in him (referring to old testament prophets who would repeatedly go to war and take over cities) but somehow loved all of us equally?” among other things. That’s a hard one for me because several times while reading the bible I don’t understand why some stories were put in because of how heartless or odd they are, specifically in the old testament as that’s what I’m reading now. I’m also struggling with why so many priests are turning out to have sins of a sexual nature for some reason. At first I thought this was far removed and less common. But in the area I’m in for only four years now TWO priests who I looked up to and viewed as amazing turned out to have a few relationships come to light, one of which being with an underaged person. I have a hard time understanding how this could happen. Yes, I get that they’re flawed and human too. I just feel doomed if the holiest people I’ve known in real life can’t believe enough to keep their promises. On top of that I have a hard time understanding why so many turn out to be interested in underaged people.

Advice On Intrusive Thoughts,AHMTY,1622332535," I've been having problems with intrusive thoughts for some time now, and the ones I've been having lately have been relating to the occult/demonic.

The sorts of thoughts basically keep trying to justify making 'deals' with evil spirits, and while I know that this is a bad mental health practice, the response tends to always be to counter-reason, but I always feel clouded when the thoughts come.

I'll also say that the fear seems to be in that I feel like this might lead me to do something occult-ish eventually or soon.

Specifically, it seems to be things like the following. I know that these thoughts are very incorrect if I reason through them, but it seems like I've been berated with them so much that it's hard for me to tell myself that.

\- Maybe I can outsmart evil spirits and get the better.

\- Maybe God isn't good or something to that effect.

\- Maybe atheism is true and so conversing with evil spirits wouldn't do anything.

\- Maybe I can sacrifice myself for a greater goal.

\- Another one is that I'll have thoughts about just doing such a thing without fear of consequence, analogous to something like jumping off of a cliff while closing your eyes and plugging your ears.

I was wondering if anyone has any advice for quickly dismissing these thoughts or something similar. Any help is appreciated.

Another problem is that it seems like I've gotten de-sensitized to this, and was wondering if anyone with a similar experience could describe if it is possible to reverse this or not.

 

I've been praying the rosary daily for some time in addition to the St. Michael's prayer as one of the final prayers, but that doesn't seem to help completely.

As a sidenote, I know this is probably to do with scrupulosity or OCD, and I'm thinking about looking into a psychiatrist to get some sort of medication, as these thoughts and similar ones have been going on for over a year now.

I am a cradle Catholic but for a few years (between the ages of 20 to 24). I became neglectful of my Catholic faith. 

For those few years I would often forget to pray, skipped church on Sundays very often, didn't take communion often, and just overall put my faith on the back burner and never bothered to read the Bible or other  Catholic content, and rarely thought about God.

I don't know what exactly caused me to be like this. But I think it's a combination of laziness, being influenced by my sister and by society. Nowadays it's considered uncool, lame, or boring to go to church, and I allowed that to influence me, which I regret so much.

I'm 25 now and in the later half of last year, I started making my return to the Catholic church. My life is so much different (and better) now. I pray the rosary often, attend mass (unfortunately it's only virtual where I live right now), am committed to being celibate, make time to read the Bible, and just overall think about God more.

But I can't help but be disappointed and upset with myself about how I neglected my faith for 4 years. And now that in-person attendance at church will be prohibited in my area for atleast another 2 months, I realize how stupid I was during those years.

If only I could turn back time and do over those years. I would have gone to church every weekend, and maybe even on weekdays whenever I could. I would have prayed the rosary a lot and attended Adoration and received communion often. I missed out on so many opportunities to be with Jesus. I could have processed so much in my faith 

And now that I turned back to my faith, I can't even go inside a church for mass and receive Holy communion. I'll never take church for granted ever again",Catholicism

Institutional racism has existed blatantly in the past like the New Deal bank loans and Jim Crowe. I like to believe it is nowhere near the levels it was up until the 80s, but it is still present in some ways. A New Jersey bank reached a settlement of $33 million in 2015 over redlining, 6 years ago. We have come a long way but the problem still exists. To deny its existence is disingenuous. I can’t comment on its importance compared to other issues in today’s society and though it might be over represented, that is no reason to dismiss it. 

Unlike poll taxes, poll tests, grandfather clause, and other Jim Crowe era laws that actively discriminated (and New Deal FHA), I don’t know if these practices are necessarily institutional b/c such as with redlining, a person is making an active decision to not give a loan, so possibly the same outcome would not happen if you switch the person (unless it was bank policy).

How can we reconcile this,Ill-Gold-4028,1622319007,"I would first like to say that I love the Church. I’m currently going through catechism as someone that recently converted from Protestantism from the Baptist denomination. Though I by no means am a Protestant as I believe in the Eucharist that it is truly the body and blood of Jesus. I believe in the immaculate conception in that Mary is the Holy Mother of God, ever-Virgin. Last but not least, I affirm that Christ appointed Peter to be the rock of his Church (Matthew 16:18) However, I was recently doing a deep dive into the gospel and while doing so I came across these verses: “By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.” (Matthew 7:16-20, Douay Rheims translation) So I guess my question is how can we as Christians that love this Church reconcile her being a truly “holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church” (nicene creed) while also acknowledging her troubled past of selling indulgences and the abuse crisis? How can we uphold our belief that the Church is a good tree while it bears evil fruits?",Catholicism

Communion &amp; Act of Contrition,TradCarlist,1622312743,"Is it alright to take communion after having done an act of contrition? I will explain myself:

Tomorrow is a special day, the Solemnity of the Holy Trinity. As a newb Catholic I have never attended church on this special day, and I wish to take the Eucharist this Sunday.

However I have a problem, which is that I committed mortal sin. I would love to go to confession as early as possible, but the problem is that I confessed very recently (this Friday), and my mother doesn't approve of me going to confession, because she doesn't want my priest to think I'm ""crazy"" or something.

I know what my mother thinks is totally wrong, because I know my priest and he probably has way more zealots that are confessing thrice a day. Compared to them I'm pretty mild (at most I have confessed twice in a week).

I don't want to book a confession secretly and make my mother angry or disappointed. She doesn't seem to be flexible about this situation, I have tried to convince her but it was fruitless.

So I thought about doing an act of contrition to take the Eucharist properly. But I don't know if that is appropriate to do. I have done it before but I didn't tell anybody (I'm sorry if it was wrong).

I think I can do an imperfect act of contrition well. Of course, I will confess as early as possible after doing it.

Is this alright to do?

I feel like Christians follows Paul's teachings more than Jesus's teachings.,Striving-For-Christ,1622310096,"Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Paul was a bad man. He seemed very inspired by Jesus and did everything he could to spread Christianity. But he was not perfect. Look at Philippians 3:12, he even says it himself.

And I'm sorry, I don't think that. I think there's more to it.

Jesus on the other hand was perfect. John 12:49-50, Jesus says all His words come straight from God. So if we want to get into Heaven, shouldn't we be listening more to what Jesus has to say then?

So what does Jesus say? Yes, we made it clear we have to believe in Him, but He said more than that. He also made it very clear we need to love our neighbours (John 13:34), and to forgive one another (Matthew 6:14). And not just neighbours, but also our enemies.

Confession of a lapsed Catholic,liberal-snowflake,1622309146,"I fell away from the Church at an early age. The process probably began when I was 14 or so. By the time I was 16, I only went to church when I was forced by my parents on certain occasions (they were twice a year church goers), or when my grandfather came to visit me, because I knew it was important to him. While my parents were not devout, my grandparents on both sides certainly were. 

Not only did I consider myself an atheist for a very long time, but there were also years where it would have been more accurate to describe myself as an anti-theist. I tend to over-intellectualize things, so I’ll spare you the details on the circuitous intellectual path that has brought me back to the Church. Needless to say, it was a long a journey, that began one day more than a year ago, during the pandemic, when for reasons I was then incapable of articulating, I felt the need to purchase a rosary. 

This morning, I partook in the sacrament of reconciliation for the first time since I was a teenager (I’m 28 now). Due to COVID restrictions where I live (we’re currently battling a nasty third wave of the virus), confession is only available at select Catholic churches in my city, and even then often only by appointment. 

I was incredibly nervous beforehand. I arrived at the church early and parked my car along the side of the street. I had about 30 minutes to spare, so I pulled out my copy of St. Augustine’s Confessions, which I’m currently working through, and began to read. Shortly before it was time to go in for my appointment, my eyes fell upon this line in Book Eight: “You never depart from us, yet it is hard for us to return to you.” 

I walked inside the church trembling. The priest greeted me with kindness and heard my long, shameful confession without interruption. After I was finished, he told me that I was like the prodigal son and that God was very happy with me today for returning to his Church. He suggested ways that I could stay connected to the Church moving forward and gave me my penance. I stepped outside, sat on the steps of the church, pulled out my rosary, and prayed my penance. As I finished, the rain stopped falling and the sounds of birds chirping came to my ears. 

When I got back into my car, I could already feel the tears forming in the corners of my eyes. By the time I was driving home, the tears really began to fall. But they were not tears of shame, but rather of gratitude. Gratitude for God’s grace which had led me back to the Church, and for the unlimited forgiveness He shows hopeless sinners like myself. 

As I write this, I am now back at home, sitting with my cat Soren – named after the Danish Christian existentialist Soren Kierkegaard, who was the first philosopher to pierce my atheism – and I could not feel more at peace. It is as if a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders. Today, I am incredibly thankful for my grandmother, who insisted I be confirmed in the Roman Catholic Church as a child, despite the fact my parents had no interest in doing so. 

Now, I plan to pray.",Catholicism

Some questions about lying as a sin and how it pertains to me,framedaugust,1622306797,"I am a 17 year old Catholic male. I am very close to graduating high school. I take my faith quite seriously, and I have been trying to look deeper into my actions and see if I am doing immoral things without fully realizing it.  

In regards to almost being done with high school, I am not a very exemplary student. For most of my time in high school, I let many assignments go unfinished and just did enough to pass. Now, this year, I have been in a rather precarious situation, with my grades in Science and Math hovering in the lower half of the 60s. I have been trying to patch this up to absolutely ensure I pass, but I have been doing this through cheating.  

Essentially, I've just been asking a friend to send me the work and answers to homework and tests so I can turn them in quickly. I've been getting good grades, but it has slowly dawned on me that this might be sin, and maybe even a mortal one. (I'm not sure) Which is why I've come here to ask - how wrong is it to cheat on my school work in this way?  

And, there is another question as well... sometimes, when my mother or father ask how I am doing on my schoolwork, I will tell them that I have completed far more of it than I actually have. For a long time I thought nothing of this, but recently I have started to wonder if this is a sin, as well.

What do you think of Andrei Tarkovsky?,Tamerovv,1622295964,"From Wikipedia: ""Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky was a Soviet-era Russian filmmaker, theatre director, writer, and film theorist. He is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential directors in the history of Russian and world cinema. His films explored spiritual and metaphysical themes, and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes, dreamlike visual imagery, and preoccupation with nature and memory."" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky)

He considered himself a person of faith and his art deals with eternal spiritual questions, with life, suffering, nostalgia, love, creation, happiness and death. He dealt a lot with other religions and spiritual schools, especially Zen, Taoism and anthroposophy, but his theoretical philosophy and art were also always about Christian ideals, symbols and mysticism. His films changed my life and made me think about the spiritual and the eternal for the first time. Even though I have not yet been baptized, I have had a great deal of interest in (especially eastern) Catholicism lately and I think it would never have occurred without Tarkovsky. Many monks and priests, on the one hand from catholic Italy, where he lived in exile, and the orthodox ones in his native country Russia, were inspired by him and his films to lead a spiritual life, even though some Christians consider him heretical. St John Paul II hold him in high regard too.

My encouragement to all musical Catholics!,QuackNagy,1622292029,"If you can sing, join your church's choir! If your church doesn't have one, form one. 

I've been attending the TLM for about 2 years now. About 6 months ago, I joined our choir to take the place of another chorister who moved states. This was mainly out of obligation. For those who are unaware, the music done at the TLM is a combination of Gregorian chant and 4-part  ""classical"" Catholic music. Though I am a singer, I found the initial task so overwhelming, and I seriously had to brush up on sight reading. 

While I sometimes question what the heck I am doing sitting in a church more than an hour before mass practicing the Credo, I *can't* *imagine *where* *I* *would* *be* *spiritually* if I never signed up. I have learnt so many prayers, passages of scripture and particularly psalms. The intimacy with the mass that I now get to enjoy is incredible. The amount of churches to which I have travelled, and the amount of extra time I now have with God in His churches have helped me to grow in reverence, patience and love.

Even little things like being first in line to receive our Lord in mass, being there early enough to prepare, and knowing that you are helping to raise the spirits of those around you up to God feel SO GOOD. 

Most of the time, I feel like an OK Catholic. Lifelong vices and periods away from the faith have left their marks on me, but this is something that is healing me greatly.

The hand of God,Tamerovv,1622286898,"A meditation by the German pastor and writer Johannes Bours on the fresco ""The hand of God"" from Sant Climent de Taüll, painted by an unknown master. It's also my profile picture on Reddit:

""The hand emerges from the white of the middle, from the space of inaccessible light. This white, overly bright light ""or the light darkness"", as the saints call it, is full of mystery. God says at the temple consecration that he wants to dwell in the dark [1 Kings 8:12). His hand extends to the person with a benevolent, inviting gesture. It stretches over the innermost circle in the royal purple color, with which the presence of God was honored in the sacred tent, mysteriously dark, as if to protect against the overly bright light; over the blue circle in which heaven turns to earth; over the red circle, the color of the spirit, God's communication of love to the world (and also the color of the sacrificial blood, the ultimate devotion). Only the hand is alive and gives life. It has the color of glory and dignity, from light above creation. It holds out, opens, touches, creates, blesses - the whole circle rests in it, is held in it: it is the life in everything.""

""Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.""

Why is the Miraculous 54 Day Rosary Novena confusing to pray?,uiolabv,1622275320,"The guidelines for praying this novena are so confusing. The concluding prayer was supped to be prayed at the end of the Rosary. If so, why is the concluding prayer written below every decade of the mystery? Why not just put it in the end? And why do some of these 54 Day Miraculous Rosary Novenas not have the Fatima prayer? And when is the Spiritual Communion prayer prayed?

And another question is this Novena should be prayed each day. But what if I prayed this Novena early in the morning like 12:30 AM? Could I still pray it later at 10:00 PM? Because I think I finished praying this Novena at 12:30 AM but I plan on praying it again before 12:00 AM.

The guidelines I checked are confusing for me. And there is this youtube video that says that on the 4th day, you should pray the Luminous mysteries despite the fact that when Mother Mary gave this prayer to the you girl, the Luminous mysteries weren't even compiled yet.

I'm a non religious theist who has posted here many times as a searcher - Catholicism is so beautiful,Sacristo1,1622259662,"I am incredibly attracted to Catholicism. It is so beautiful. I'm currently in a state of pure poetic appreciation for being. I'm an Aristotelian, which is the key philosophical system by which I've come to believe in a primary cause for being. For some reason right now something is resonating deep with me with regards to objective beauty and the holistic system of Catholicism. Catholicism safeguards teleological ethics, and there's something about the religion that just gets human nature. Maybe I'm too many wine cups deep tonight, but God damn, Catholicism is beautiful. Usually I'm too coldly rational to indulge these poetic thoughts of beauty but right now I'm totally in love with the idea of Catholicism being the great bastion of ethical thought.

I want to pray to God but I do not know him, and I currently don't think the historical evidence supports a risen Christ. But what an amazing story. Something deeply profound about a God dying for his creation, a self-giving replenishment of being through the emptying of the divine into the mortal. There's nothing more blissful than that. Absolutely amazing. I'm so glad right now I'm seeing this with eyes anew, viewing the Christian story as strange, alien, and exotic as the first Christians saw it - earth shattering.",Catholicism

Question About How Grace Works,Psylocke_X-23,1622256800,"I just took AP tests and am hoping to get a good score on AP Chemistry in particular.


Additionally, although I understand its rather questionable, for my mental health (Which has been in shambles for years) as a trans person, I'm planning on buying some breast forms to wear *in private occasionally*. I havent talked to a priest specifically about this item, but I did talk to a priest a few years ago about my private cross dressing in general and he said that it's only a minor venial sin as long as I'm doing it in private as a way to calm myself rather than trying to change my identity (Its been a few years so it's possible I'm slightly misremembering what he said). Unless anybody has better information, I'm assuming that the small sinfulness applies to the breast forms as well, even if it is a step farther than I've gone previously.


Although I might change my mind, assuming that I am at some point over the next few months going to get the forms, will getting them sooner rather than after AP Test results are out impact how willing God is to assist me with getting a good AP Chemistry score?


On one hand, it feels like that would be as if Gods love was simply a transaction, which sounds wrong. On the other hand, it feels intuitive that doing something somewhat wrong would impact my relationship with God, although I am not sure if anything beyond the intention to get them should be considered. In other words, I'm not sure if Gods willingness to assist me would be impacted by me purposefully waiting to do something that I have already more or less decided to do.

Saint Thomas Aquinas Doctor of the Church on Islam,Sanderson324,1622245524,"""Mohammed seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us. His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected; he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the natural ability of anyone with a very modest wisdom. Indeed, the truths that he taught he mingled with many fables and with doctrines of the greatest falsity.

""He did not bring forth any signs produced in a supernatural way, which alone fittingly gives witness to divine inspiration; for a visible action that can be only divine reveals an invisibly inspired teacher of truth. On the contrary, Mohammed said that he was sent in the power of his arms – which are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants. What is more, no wise men, men trained in things divine and human, believed in him from the beginning. Those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers, utterly ignorant of all divine teaching, through whose numbers Mohammed forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms. Nor do divine pronouncements on the part of preceding prophets offer him any witness. On the contrary, he perverts almost all the testimony of the Old and the New Testaments by making them into a fabrication of his own, as can be seen by anyone who examines his law. It was, therefore, a shrewd decision on his part to forbid his followers to read the Old and New Testaments, lest these books convict him of falsity. It is thus clear that those who place faith in his words believe foolishly.""

"Uncertainty, doubt, and pain can be your friend.",LoveByCandlelight,1622236946,"Uncertainty, pain, sadness, and doubt can be a friend to you. If you’re like me, you might have spent your life running away from pain. Maybe you’ve tried techniques to reduce or eliminate the sorrows in your life. 

But I’ve found something that helps. This is for anyone who needs it, anyone who is struggling with grief, mental illness, shame, guilt, temptation, or any other negative experience...

The only real answer that’s seemed to work is to **surrender to God** 

What I mean is, *no more fighting* 

I thought the fighting was what helped. I did my best to avoid anxiety and avoid uncertainty, but it only beget more and more sadness. Ultimately, stopping fighting and letting pain wash over me like ocean waves is what helps. 

It’s easy to say you’ll surrender to God but harder to do it. *To surrender to God means you shouldn’t flinch in emotional pain, you shouldn’t try to drown out your sorrows with food and drink, you shouldn’t binge watch Netflix just so you don’t feel it.*

We are so desperate to not feel pain. It’s like we must be happy otherwise something is wrong. 

*But think about it, in feelings of sadness you are forced to rely on God.* 

It’s when we are weak that we need strength.  If everything were always good, how can our love and reliance on God be tested? 

You are who you are in the midst of pain. That’s where the real trial begins. 

**C.S Lewis said “To love at all is to be vulnerable.”**

You can only really be vulnerable when you’re in pain. You can say you’re vulnerable when you’re happy, but ultimately it is pain that gets you there. 

Lastly, here is a quick and easy exercise I found in a therapy book. It was used as a mindfulness exercise but I tweaked it 

**exercise:** Hold one ice cube in your hand for 60 seconds. Have a towel with you because you will get wet. Your hand will start hurting. Focus on the pain as a way to practice surrendering it to God. Let this be a small practice to prepare you for the many pains in life.",Catholicism

Well, one of the biggest triggers is whenever these dreams happen. This lead sup to this... physical sensation or pressure within my chest, which almost always leads to a relapse. I can't put it into words, maybe lust personified? 

In order not to commit sacrilege, I took off my sacramentals. Though I fell for that passion driven lie: ""You fell once, why not fall some more?"" Would Our Father even hear my Acts of Contrition? 

I'm currently writing a check list and procedure to combat these things. Bought some more content blockers for all my devices, and am currently going to keep my electronics physically out of my portion of my home. I reached out, ashamed to a loved one and asked for their assistance. 

I'm so worried, it seems like this always happens before a confession, which I planned to go to tomorrow.

How do I deal with: 1 Samuel 15?,Luckychatt,1622231527,"On the one hand I see Jesus full of forgiveness and love and with messages like: ""love your enemy"" which is so inspiring. Jesus is God. They are one and the same. And so when I read 1 Samuel 15 I find it difficult to reconcile Jesus with God who orders Saul to do the following:

&gt; Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

&gt; And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

&gt; But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and of the oxen, and of the fatlings and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

&gt; Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying,

&gt; I repent that I have set up Saul to be king, for he has turned back from following Me and hath not performed My commandments.” And it grieved Samuel, and he cried unto the Lord all night.

In summary:
God(Jesus) orders Saul to kill children and infants. Saul kills the children with a sword. Saul spare the lives of some of the animals, and that makes God(Jesus) angry because he ordered everything to be killed.

Why did he not tell Saul to love your enemy? I imagine if someone like Hitler were to read this passage he could use it  to convince himself that it is sometimes okay to completely wipe out a people that you don't like, children included. How do I reconcile this passage with the live of Jesus?",Catholicism

How to feel God?,Gui_Sailormoon,1622228439,"I’m 16 years old and I was born into a Catholic family, as a child I did my Catholic duties more out of obedience to my parents (who I love so much), than understanding the reason for all this. In that time, I was baptized, I made my first communion, and when I became a teenager, the existential questions started and I started to move further away from the church. I studied a lot about science, philosophy, and although I had a lot of problems with Christianity regarding unanswered questions that bothered me at the time, I kept going to church and praying, but very loosely.
The thing is that in recent times, with my emotional, mental and also philosophical maturation, I have been increasingly interested in Christianity and mainly in the catholic church, my religion of birth. I see that there is a serious problem in non-theistic models of thought which is the notion of right and wrong, and of all the religions I know, Catholicism is what I like most, I feel that there is an intention to fight for peace on earth through the love of God diluted in this religion. And I like it much more than any cheap materialist theory (which in the end remain inconclusive and unsatisfactory when it comes to the topic of morality). 
And so, lately I have been praying the rosary, and studying more about the doctrine of the church, trying to be an active Catholic, but sometimes I have a problem, I feel like I'm doing what I do because of church dogma and not because I genuinely love God. In fact I still can't even tell if I feel God, and I'd like to feel him; to do the right thing for him and not just for a decision coming from me.
I know it's a tough question, but how could I genuinely connect with God?

Can people renounce Catholicism?,cantstopwontstopever,1622226601,"I was born into a Catholic home, went to a Catholic school, took part in all the sacraments etc. When I reached high school age, I began to question its teachings and had difficulty with the countless scandals beleaguering the church. Later in life, I learned that kids I grew up with were victims of abuse at the hands of priests and decided that the church no longer had a place in my life. This week, a mass grave containing the skeletal remains of children was found in a place where the Catholic Church ran a residential school. My mind raced and I almost vomited at the idea of there being a filing cabinet somewhere in a church basement with my name on a piece of paper as proof of my Catholic baptism and holy communion. 

Simply not going to church or turning my back isn’t enough for me. I want the Catholic Church to know that I’m 100% out. Done and gone. I’m no longer Catholic. Stamps it, no erasies. Over the top? Sure. Vindictive? Yep. Is there a process for renouncing Catholicism?",Catholicism

Apologizing for the Eucharist,LucretiusOfDreams,1622213949,"My pastor gave a homily a few weeks ago where he pointed out that people who completely separate from the Church always lack a belief in the transubstantiation of the Eucharist.

“To whom shall we go?” is well put, because even if someone doesn’t accept Christ’s doctrine on, say, the current controversies, nevertheless recognizing the unique character of the Eucharist, that there is nowhere else to get it, and having a need for it, conscious or otherwise, will still keep such a person in the orbit of the Church in some capacity.

I bring this us because I think many of us need some fresh air with regard to the Catholic politician controversies. I’m not saying we are wrong to want to bar, say, the president of the United States from the Eucharist. This might be the right thing to do. But I do think our zeal might be blinding us from what my pastor says. Just because we would and should condition the Eucharist only to those who are willing to accept Christ’s doctrine, that doesn’t mean that conditioning the Eucharist actually works as a means to convert the minds or hearts of these people.

Faith, after all, is not understanding, even though it does tends towards it: just because someone doesn’t agree with the Church on certain issues, and just because we cannot convince him or her otherwise with our arguments, because of their stubbornness, because of our own ignorance, doesn’t mean they cannot be convinced to humble themselves, accept that they might be blind and that this keeps them from being able to see the truth of Christ’s teaching, and so let Christ’s teaching guide them *even if* they don’t understand *why* Christ is actually correct, and actually only see reasons to think otherwise.

The mind might be darkened, but what saves us is not understanding how the faith is correct, but simply accepting the faith despite us not understanding *how* the faith is correct.

And the Eucharist is the ultimate expressing of this sort of faith, because **every single one of us** only experiences the Eucharist as bread and wine, and all of us have **no** actual understanding of how these things, that have the same characteristics of bread and wine, could *possibly* be the body and blood, soul and divinity, of Christ. *Everything in our actual understanding* says that the Eucharist is just normal bread and wine. But we nevertheless accept the truth about the Eucharist despite everything in our minds telling us the opposite, because we trust Christ’s word that he is right about this, even though, again, *all* of our own reasoning and understandings tell us the opposite. Faith is not merely accepting the teaching of Christ when we understand it (or think we do), faith is accepting the teaching of Christ even when we *don’t* understand it —and even more so.

If someone accepts the Eucharist, or is willing to humbly swallow the Eucharist despite all sensations and reasoning telling them otherwise, then convincing them to do the same with regard to the truth about abortion, gay marriage, transgenderism, etc. should at least be possible, even potentially *easier,* especially if we root our apology in the beliefs they already hold regarding the Eucharist.

To be honest, the biggest reason people accept the views they do on many of the current controversies is because they accept the testimony of the world on these things. But I think we’ve also noticed that most people are also fed up and angry at the world too —maybe we should use that slither (or gap, as might be the case) of mistrust in the ways the world to wedge people away from trusting other parts of the testimony of the world against the Gospel of Christ? Maybe then we can use what trust a person already has in the testimony of Christ as a place to begin leading them to all truth?",Catholicism

"Former protestants, how has your spiritual life changed since you became a catholic?",theotokosprayforus,1622206121,"How has your spiritual life changed? For me personally, it makes so much sense to go to confession! I'm an RCIA candidate and I can't wait to go to confession. James 5:16 says that we must confess our sins to one another, and having the sacrament of reconciliation is the perfect way to follow God's commandment. My prayer life is also much richer. As a protestant, I thought that prayers were essentially just for intentions (not to say that this is how all protestants pray, but that was how I perceived prayer to be). The rosary has been so amazing! I also pray with icons now, and with beautiful  chants in the background sometimes, and I realized how prayer really is about praying with the whole self (body and mind and spirit!). I love praying to Our Blessed Mother and to the saints... It makes me realize how we have this wonderful, amazing cloud of witnesses who are there to intercede for us! 

So how has your spiritual life changed since you became a catholic? Is there anything you miss as a protestant? 

I also noticed that in catholicism, there is a focus on holiness and becoming one with God. With protestants (at least the denomination my family comes from), there was a lot of focus on material blessings and lots of ""Jesus loves you, don't worry about anything!"" and there was no focus on repentance or holiness. This way of thinking actually pushed me so far from God because my life used to be a living hell, and I didn't know how to cope with so much suffering.",Catholicism

But this does not seem to be fulfilling my penance since I specifically did not offer the prayers up exactly for what my penance requires of me in the direct assumed manner, and thus it would seem a sin to go to Confession.

Asking for things for one's pleasures,BeautifulGenius10,1622189269,"James 4:3 says, ""You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, in order to spend what you get on your pleasures.""

But Jesus said,

""Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for a fish, will give a snake instead of a fish? Or if the child asks for an egg, will give a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children""

An ordinary child asks for fish/egg to satisfy her/his own bodily hunger and for her/his own pleasure, and Jesus said parents who give their child fish/egg are giving ""good gifts"". Jesus was most likely referring to ordinary parents because he said ""If you then, who are evil"".

Jesus also said, ""Very truly, I tell you, if you ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. ... Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.""

"An excerpt from Fr. James Altman's parish bulletin, something to look at amid the resignation scandal",Parkinmyyard,1622182054,"I for one was very taken aback when I heard the news about Fr. Altman being asked to resign by his bishop. But after doing some research, my position is wavering. This is taken from the May 2 bulletin from his parish in La Crosse, Wisconsin. 

&gt;IT’S YOUR BODY.   IT’S YOUR TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.  IT’S YOUR CHOICE.          Dear family, for the record, I did not get a single vaccine as a child.  After my older sister almost died from an allergic reaction to one, my mother just said “no.”  Thus I was incredulous when someone sent me a meme of a baby doll with 14 VAX needles stuck in it, indicating that a baby   receives that many vaccines by the age of 2.  Surely, thought I, this meme must be false.       Nope.  It is true.  I researched it and discovered that The American Academy of Pediatrics has 14 vaccine recommendations even before a baby hits 18 months of age.  However, the number is 14 only because there area at least 14 different ones, but the fact is that there is a schedule to   inject the baby 30 times by the time they hit 18 months!  The CDC recommends that all children receive 50 doses of 14 vaccines between birth and age six and at least 69 doses of 16 vaccines   between birth and age eighteen.  This more than doubles the childhood schedule of 34 doses of 11 vaccines in the year 2000.  While continuing to ardently add new vaccines and doses, the CDC has never conducted a single study on whether or not this growing vaccine schedule is safe for our children.   In fact, NOBODY has studied the effect of 14 pathogens and a boatload of aluminum   hitting that little baby’s body pretty much all at once.     However, according to Wisconsin United For Freedom, the U.S. gives 2-3 times more vaccines than most developed countries, yet still has among the highest rates of chronic childhood illnesses!     I researched further.  It got more interesting.  My opinion in these matters does not count. What matters are the facts, including the fact that since 1986, manufacturers, doctors and provid-ers who administer vaccines are completely shielded from liability for vaccine injuries or death.  Since 1989, the U.S. Government has paid out over $4.5 billion to victims of vaccine injury through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.  Rather than holding pharmaceutical compa-nies fiscally responsible for the harm their products cause, NVICP is funded by U.S. taxpayers through a 75-cent excise tax imposed on each vaccine dose.      SO - let us be informed, not opinionated.  And let us be affirmed in the Truth that there is no   legitimate science behind the experimental injection being pushed upon us by shaming and virtue-signaling.  Dear family, be very afraid of those who so flippantly bear false witness against your body, against your Temple of the Holy Spirit.

"I just watched parts of the Saw Movies, knowing I would get freaked out. How can I ensure I turn to God when I get scared?",doorknobsandboxes,1622173181,"This is stupid, I know. I’m 15, and I get so scared watching horror movies. My friend played Fnaf (a video game with self-thinking animatronics) and I got freaked out by the movie *The Sixth Sense*, which was clever in the plot twist, but SUPER unbelievable in the real world and I couldn’t sleep for weeks or days after experiencing either. 

Well someone at school brought up the Jigsaw movies a couple days ago, and I ended up watching videos titled “How to survive the Saw movies”. I shouldn’t have, I knew I would panic, but now I’m panicking. Based on Saw’s judgement, I’m not completely off the list for those traps, and it got me thinking I might be going to hell. I’m not a good person guys, but I have sins I keep repeating and I’m scared to confess because the priests at my parish said they aren’t really forgiven until you stop repeating them. I don’t have the willpower on my own to stop committing these sins, but I also don’t have the support in my life. My Godfather passed sadly but is hopefully in heaven, my Godmother is not particularly religious, and my Confirmation sponsor stopped believing around the time I got confirmed. My siblings stopped believing, so any mention of religion is turned into weird looks from them. As is common in Catholic families, we’re a moderately large family and my parents just don’t have time to be alone with me. I’ve just felt so hopeless for a while now faith-wise, and someone at my church broke the vow of silence on sins (I am so sorry, I forgot the name) when they told someone a sin I confessed. I just feel like I’ve gone from a wonderful faithful relationship surrounded by people who understood me to a tense fight where I’m too scared to take a stance. 

This is such a packed, rambling question, but How can I turn to God when I don’t feel comfortable in my own house? How can I learn to forgive? How can I ensure I trust in God to be there when I’m scared of silly things like Saw and real issues like hell? This week was “finals” week, and tomorrow is my last day of this school year. Is there a way I cope with losing some things (like my favorite teacher)? I just feel like I’m losing trust and I need someone I can rely on. How can I tell if God is listening to me?

Any philosophers here willing to discuss existentialism? Or how to go from first unmoved mover to Christian God?,Benedict_I_OCP,1622165714,"Greetings, 

I have a friend who is both an atheist and existentialist. Last night I spoke with him and his guiding philosophy is basically ""Everyone searches for the meaning of life. No one can know with certainty whether or not they've found it. This is absurd. Therefore the only solution is if you create your own meaning."" or ""the meaning of life is to do whatever keeps you from killing yourself."" It's not a logical syllogism whereby X, then y, therefore Z but the way he explained it kinda made sense.

I pointed out that Christianity is fundamentally different because it isn't one person saying ""I've found the meaning of life"" but existence itself or being itself or the author of life itself or even life itself revealing to us meaning. So his existentialism would only be true if he had demonstrable evidence that any claims of divine revelation were false. He said he did and that is our next (yet to happen) conversation. 

The reason I bring this here however is in previous discussions he's come to accept the unmoved mover and first uncontingent being. How do I go from these to a God who has revealed himself or is intelligent and cares about humans or can/wants to reveal himself and not just a ""first mover"" or watchmaker type God?

Sola Scriptura in the Summa?,OrmanRedwood,1622165113,"For context, I am Catholic,not Protestant, and I have begun reading through St. Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica and have just finished Question 1 of the first part on the nature and extent of sacred doctrine. This passage in Article 8, reply to objection 2, a quote from Augustine, stuck out to me:


&gt; Only those books of Scripture which are called canonical have I learned to hold in such honor as to believe their authors have not erred in any way in writing them. But other authors I so read as not to deem anything in their works to be true, merely on account of their having so thought and written, whatever may have been their holiness and learning.


A quote from St. Thomas himself that provides context in the same section of the Summa is as follows:


&gt; Nevertheless, sacred doctrine makes use of these authorities as extrinsic and probable arguments; but properly uses the authority of the canonical Scriptures as an incontrovertible proof, and the authority of the doctors of the Church as one that may properly be used, yet merely as probable. For our faith rests upon the revelation made to the apostles and prophets, who wrote the canonical books, and not on the revelations (if any such there are) made to other doctors.


It does appear to me as if in this article St. Thomas is making the argument that scripture is the only infallible authority for matters of doctrine, but don't councils define dogmas infallibly?  Obviously it doesn't rest upon the words of doctors, and he has not yet discussed the authority of the Church on these matters, but how does St. Thomas adress the authority of the Church, particularly in matters of sacred doctrine?

Reformed Babtism,Notmymaincauseimbi,1622164601,"I want some feedback for this POV on Reformed Babtism doctrine, mostly to see if I'm making a mistake.

Baptism in the reformed tradition is a slow dripping poison. It implies either a works based salvation or the active condemnation of people into hell. This is probably most clear with the of same-sex attraction. Imagine someone attempts to join the church. If all of our sins are forgiven and their trusted to God, however there is no visible Sacrament in which you can base this belief then how can you it ever happened? This is no triviality because there's two possibilities. Either God has determined that he will not Grant you a membership into the elect for his own reasons, or God has determined that you have not worked hard enough by either reading the Bible or having enough faith to Merit being born again.

All of this destroys our faith if you're actively working through an issue. Because it becomes very easy to blame God himself for these issues. I know from personal experience. You then need to be able to cement the idea that yes you can know when you're within God's church we can actively choose to be within it.

Angel sighting?,apfu10,1622161786,"Long story short, a close family member of mine has been suffering a long, up and down battle with cancer for the last few years. She's currently going through a tough stretch at the minute, and as a family, we've been praying for her health every day. This past weekend, while kneeling at his pew before mass, her husband was approached by a man who he thought looked ""vaguely familiar"" in distinct, bright colored clothing. The man pulled from his pocket two rosary beads, saying that one was for his wife, and the other was for him. He left the pew, and as my family member looked back to thank/talk to him, he was nowhere to be seen. No one in the mass that he spoke to saw this man, and there were no signs he was there at all besides the beads he gave to my family member. He even went back to the live stream and saw no signs of him there. Again, he was wearing very distinct clothing, and he would've stood out to anyone who saw him. 

I immediately tried to rationalize this, but I'm becoming more and more convinced that he was an angel. I know that angels can take human form, but the thought of a close family member experiencing an angel, up close and personal, is beyond my comprehension.

      Do you know the true mediation of the Agony in the Garden? 

Our Lord, our friend and first love, is fully God and Fully Man, and is on his knees, and possibly lying flat on the ground in absolute, sheer misery and pain. Pain, knowing and *feeling*, and seeing every evil action, every blaspheme, every sin, every hate filled slur, every murder, rape, molestation, trafficking, destruction, war and piece of atrocity on Earth that has ever happened and will ever happen. During this, the blood vessels in his face actually broke from the sheer pain and agony he felt and was going through. 
     I don’t think people understand this. For this to happen, the body has to be pushed beyond its extremes, beyond any natural limit set in stone by biological precedents and psychological barriers. The physical pain of what He was going through, was enough to actually rupture sub-surface capillaries and small vessels beneath his skin. To the point, where the blood mingled with the sweat and tears that fell to earth. We know He was Fully God, and shared a fully human nature. The Human nature was broken at this point, the Scourging and crucifixion was the beating of dead flesh to put it to terms. Christ’s human nature was broken at this point, not just from feeling sin, but experiencing what sin *does* to others. 
     What rape, violence, anger, gluttony, abuse, murder, torture does to all of humanity or were to occur in the future, Christ felt the pain of all humanity in that garden. His humanity was beyond broken. To the point, where he had begged God the Father not once, not twice, but *three* times. Lucifer was tempting him from the cup he was about to drink and on top of this, the worst spiritual, physical and mental torment ever inflicted upon a living creature, was poured onto Him.
     His Divinity, was in sorrow. Sin hurts Him, and in that Garden, he felt the blow of every ridicule and unbelieving and despairing sin ever committed. Against His most gentle, affectionate heart, full of unspeakable love for all of humanity, was slapped and spat upon. “I’m to broken to be loved by you.”, “You could never forgive me of my past!”, “What about others? Where were you when they were in pain?”, “You never talked back to me, so I left.”
     There are no words in any of the tongues of man that can adequately describe His grief at each and every one of these words, even from His own children! From me, you and all who ever will live. 

     And yet, despite all these woes and torments he endured, He willingly mounted the cross to die for every single soul. He is affection and gentleness personified. Why do you run from Him when He waits for you to come to him? “Come to me all you who are labored and I will give you rest.” Why are you afraid of Him? Look at the nail wounds and see if you can still doubt His gentle love for you. Rest assured, whatever pain you went through or will go through, He suffered with you first before anyone else.

    There are so many posts from so many people asking if He loves them if; They’re ashamed, wrathful, sinful, adulterous, gluttonous, hateful, prideful... I assure you, if you tell Our Gentle Jesus how much you are sorry for whatever you have done, He will be the first to tell you that He loves you.

&gt;15Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, and all the women standing by—a great assembly—along with all the people living in the land of Egypt and in Pathros,e said to Jeremiah, 16“As for the word you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you! 17Instead, we will do everything we vowed to do: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and offer drink offerings to her, just as we, our fathers, our kings, and our officials did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem.At that time we had plenty of food and good things, and we saw no disaster. 18But from the time we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been perishing by sword and famine.”

&gt;19“Moreover,” said the women, “when we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands’ knowledge that we made sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”

So we have people doing the exact same thing God detested in the book of Jeremiah and no one is saying anything?

Jeremiah 7
&gt;16As for you, do not pray for these people, do not offer a plea or petition on their behalf, and do not beg Me, for I will not listen to you. 17Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 18The sons gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven; they pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke Me to anger. 19But am I the One they are provoking? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves they spite, to their own shame?


We are instructed not to even pray for them? I never believed more in not being able to see the truth except through the Holy Spirit as I have today. 



&gt;24Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all those of Judah who are in the land of Egypt. 25This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands your words: ‘We will surely perform our vows that we have made to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.’ Go ahead, then, do what you have promised! Keep your vows!

&gt;26Nevertheless, hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah living in Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by My great name, says the LORD, that never again will any man of Judah living in the land of Egypt invoke My name or say, ‘As surely as the Lord GOD lives.’

&gt;27I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and every man of Judah who is in the land of Egypt will meet his end by sword or famine, until they are finished off.

What are some of the roles and responsibilities of a religious specialist in the Catholic Church?,HollyTheMage,1622156367,"Hello! I am a college student who is working on an ethnography for the Catholic Church as the final project for my religious anthropology class, and I was wondering if the users of this forum could help me by answering some questions I have about their roles and responsibilities as religious specialists in the Catholic Church (technically I was supposed to interview someone for an hour, however none of the people I contacted ever bothered to reply to me, so now I'm open sourcing this). If you are going to respond to this, please do so within the next day or so, because this assignment is due on Friday, May 28th, at midnight.

Also before you answer any questions please state that you consent to this questioning process and that you understand the purpose of the interview.

Questions:

1. The Anthropology of Religion, Magic, and Witchcraft by Philip L. Stein &amp; Rebecca L. Stein loosely defines priests as “full-time religious specialists associated with formalized religious institutions that may be linked with kinship groups, communities, or larger political units and are given religious authority by those units or formal religious organizations'' and that they “act as a representative of the community in dealing with with the deity or deities.” Do you think that this is an accurate description of the work you do? How does it differ from your own personal definition of what a priest is and what purpose they serve?
2. How are religious specialists like yourself described in the scriptures or other source materials of your religious doctrine? Is your role and the responsibilities that come with it clearly delineated in the teachings of your religion? And how much discretion is left up to the individual on the ways in which they may choose to carry out those responsibilities?
3. This can be considered a follow up question to the previous two questions, and how you answered the first and second question will likely play into how you answer this one. The Anthropology of Religion, Magic, and Witchcraft also states that one of the ways a priest acts as an intermediate between the community they are representing and the deity or deities they are in contact with is through the performance of prescribed rituals. These include periodic rituals on a ceremonial calendar, as well as rites of passage such as birth and death related rituals, or weddings. They may also perform rituals in the event of a disaster or illness. What are some examples of the rituals you perform in your capacity as a priest? If performing rituals is not a part of your responsibilities as a priest, or then what other work does your duty as a priest entail? If your job as a priest includes performing rituals as well as performing non-ritual related duties, please tell me about those as well.
4. What purposes do the rituals or other work that you perform serve in your community? Does it act in part as a social rite of intensification meant to reinforce a system of beliefs or encourage adherence to an established ethical code?
5. In what ways are you held to a different set of standards for conduct in comparison to the rest of the population?",Catholicism
Why do good things happen to bad people?,BertMaklin-FBI,1622155944,"I always hear this question asked the other way around. I don’t struggle with the suffering of the righteous, as I understand it brings us closer to Jesus and His suffering, among other spiritual benefits.

(Long) What should I do? Perhaps the scariest event of my life so far.,MeNoLikeKoriander,1622151978,"Hello

I wanted to share with you a very bizarre experience I had today, as I'm a little scared and not sure what to do.

I live in a two bedroom apartment in a college campus with my best friend. Our apartment building has a basement, and in this basement there is a sauna.

Me and my roommate frequently use this sauna, but mostly in the weekends and we usually also invite 4 or so friends. Today, we decided to go to the sauna in the middle of the week just us, because our day was very stressful.

Once in the sauna, we sit down quiet for about 10 minutes when we suddenly hear someone outside. This is usually normal, as there is a storage room right next to the sauna.

However, suddenly the man started screeching. I don't mean yelling, like he got upset. I don't mean raising his voice, like he called out to a friend. I don't mean screaming, like he got injured.

I mean screeching, like a raven or a bat. He then started screeching very loud and cursing at the top of his lungs, saying things like ""satan, satan"", ""bloody hell"", and other things which I cannot write here.

Me and my roommate were pretty nervous at this point, and didn't know what to do. We heard him walk away, like he left, and thought he was just some guy having a really bad day. Then a minute later he is back, only this time he begins pounding on the door and trying to get it open. The door to the sauna is locked with a deadbolt from the inside, thankfully. We started checking if anyone of us brought a phone by mistake so we could call the police, but no luck. At this point we can hear the man, still screeching at the top of his lungs, walking back and forth, making strange noises. Sometimes jiggling the doorknob and trying to bust open the door.

We panic and decide this is a fantastic time to get fully dressed and prepare to run like heck back to our apartment the first second he has his back turned. 

As we're getting dressed we can hear him walk away from the door, but we're not sure he's entirely gone. I look through the crevace under the door to see if I can see his feet anywhere. 

He's gone.

We walk out holding a broomstick ready to strike if he shows up being violent or whatnot. We are walking towards the elevator when suddenly we hear a noise that makes my heart drop.

The elevator arrived, with someone in it.

Sweating profusely and saying prayers in my head to mother Mary that this is not the end of my run. We get a sigh of what could be the biggest relief I've sensed in a long time. Out steps a young woman heading to the laundryroom with her small puppy. 

We instantly warn her that there is a violent and aggressive man somewhere around yelling evil things at the top of his lungs.

She says that she's heard him before, but never met or seen him, but he usually does this sort of thing at nighttime or very early in the mornings.

Apparently this has been going on for THREE YEARS and no one has done anything yet. 

I thanked her for the information and asked her to also send an email to the landlord.

We walked back to our apartment and called campus security, followed by sending an email to my landlord regarding the event.

Since then, I've been in my apartment not sure what to do. 

What are your thoughts on this? Is there some type of demonic presence with this man, or is he just psychologically not well? What can I do more than just inform my landlord and pray for him?",Catholicism

Weird confession encounter...wondering if this is common.,boy_beauty,1622145701,"So for context, I was baptized at the beginning of April, so I've only been to 3 confessions even though I've been practicing Catholicism for about a year now.

One of my struggles has been porn/masturbation. I've improved greatly since this time last year, although I have relapsed plenty of times along the course of the last year. That said, I confess every week I relapse. Sometimes my relapses span 4-5 days. I went to a different church than the one I go to for Mass - one much closer to where I live. I don't know any of the priests there. The first two confessions I made for them went smoothly. I confessed, he asked how many times, I answered honestly, he provided brief insight, referenced a section of the Gospel, gave me a penance, etc.

The third time, I confessed to a different priest from the first two times. I had never met this priest before, much less had a confession with him. I confessed the sin, he asked how many times, I answered about 10-12 (it was a bad week). He seemed to get angry and told me that he would not absolve me of my sins because he didn't think I was actually remorseful. He told me that I should go to the chapel and pray about it, and that if afterwards I felt remorseful then I should come back and he would absolve me. He then said that if I continue to commit these sins, I should go to another priest for confession because he would not absolve me. 

However, before actually making me do this, he asked me how old I was. I told him I was 24, and he seemed to hesitate, and said that he thought I was older. Now, although my voice is fairly deep, it is very clearly the voice of a male in his late teens or early twenties. I'm also 5'7, thin, with the face of a 16 year old boy. I have never been mistaken for being older than I am; in fact, people usually assume I'm a teenager. I have no idea why he thought I was older, unless he thought I was someone else, and was going to refuse me on that basis (perhaps this other person has a persisent problem with the same sin).

After his hesitation, he asked me what I was doing in order to prevent myself from being tempted. I gave a few answers, he gave suggestions, and eventually he gave me a penance and I left.

Is this a common occurrence? Has anyone had a similar experience?",Catholicism

Then I hit a depression with porn and facing and processing my sexual assault as a minor that ruined the relationship with my über devout girlfriend who said that I was all she'd ever hope for in a husband. 

I was at a really low point and none of my catholic ""friends"" would try to help me. I couldn't go to church or pray anymore without massive anxiety or burning anger at God. I felt (and still feel a little) like I'd rather go to hell than worship the God that let me be sexually assaulted.

I reached out to my more secular friends that I hung out with less and was actually able to talk about my feelings without being judged or feeling like a freak for having emotions and I feel more comfortable around them in general than the people at my church that were way more stuck up.

I haven't gone to mass in 2 months and I haven't even tried to pray in a month and a half and I've never had less anxiety in my life. I've been able to completely quit porn and form healthy friendships that I actually feel comfortable and loved in.

My conversion story - From mocking God to being saved by Him,DeviceDue3180,1622136602," Tldr: Jesus Christ was the only God I've ever mocked, and He was also the only One who answered my prayer when I was at my lowest.  


I was raised in a non-religious family, and growing up I've seldom felt drawn to religion. Then, in college, I got bullied by a group of Catholic girls. The experience made me start distancing myself from Catholicism and making fun of their God with my friends.   


My life got worse and worse as time went on. I encountered problems from all sides: family, finances, death of my beloved, loss of close friends, existential crisis, basically everything went wrong. The bullying from said Catholic girls persisted. Previously, I identified as an atheist and refused to believe in any kind of god, but as I became weaker and weaker, I started to practice witchcraft, go to religious places, pay for spiritual coaches, and pray to religious figures and gods.   


Nothing worked. One day, when I was seriously contemplating suicide, I went on Youtube and found a Catholic girl talking about God's infinite Love for her.   


'How naive.' I thought. 'Life's going to destroy her.' Yet I was drawn to her innocence. God seemed to be doing a pretty good job protecting her from the harshness of life. Maybe I could pray to God, who knows, I haven't tried that, have I? Not like I had anything to lose, being so close to death I was.  


'God, please save me.' I thought. I opened my mouth to say the prayer, then closed my mouth as I remembered all those times I mocked Him and His followers.   


I gave up and went to sleep.  


My prayer got answered 2 hours later.   


You might say it's a coincidence. I do not wish to talk about details because it's my personal story, but He showed me signs (private revelations, hints) to make sure that it was Him who helped me, not any false god I've prayed to before.  


He, whom I found wicked delight in mocking, was also the same One who answered my prayer when I was getting nothing from the false gods I worshipped. I didn't even say the prayer out loud. I didn't go to Church or know anything about the Bible. I was a sinner. And yet He listened and reached out to help me.  


When you encounter God you just know. He shows you the Truth in a way that makes sense. He shows you Love in such a way that you feel like you're the only one He loves. He lightens up your entire world and drags you from the pit hole you fell in. Suddenly you feel complete in a way nothing on earth has ever made you feel.  


After this encounter, I joined an RCIA group and lost half of my friends. I gave up my childhood dream of working for the government (because it discriminates against Christians) and ended up being unemployed for a while. I face frequent ridicule, the same mocking I did before God saved me. I am resigned to the fact that I'll probably be single for the rest of my life, because very few atheist men want a Catholic marriage, and even fewer Catholic men in my place would want marriage with a past sinner.   


Honestly, though, I feel like the happiest woman on the Earth having the LORD my God with me every step of the way.  


I now work as a teacher who teaches mainly Catholic students. I gain as many new Catholic friends as the ones I've lost, and they're one thousand times better. Every day I wake up grateful and happy. My family are doing much better than before. I've forgiven the Catholic girls who bullied me.  


I am loved by the most powerful and most merciful God, and that fact alone gives me courage to fight my hardest battles.  


I don't share this story to many people. However, I felt called to share my story today on my way to Church. Maybe God has a plan for this testimony. Thank you for reading. Apologies for potential mistakes - English is my second language.",Catholicism

Only catholics go to heaven?,Jealous_Act1958,1622136330,"So I just read this Catholic article on social media. It was about the testimony of a woman who temporarily died and experienced purgatory. She narrates how she was struck by lightning, and narrates how she went into a white light tunnel. It said that she saw her family who had died and hugged them. I didn’t really understand. But then she was talking about a place where there was people suffering and the love of God wasn’t being felt in that place. And that there was a lot of young people that comitted suicide. And that before that she was catholic but wasn’t that close to God I guess. And she always thought that she didn’t believe that priest said about demons and she didn’t believe in hell or sins. And she saw the demons and she was screaming that she wanted to be led out of that place. And she yelled “I am Catholic”. And she heard a sweet voice and saw the Virgin Mary. And I don’t know if Mary or the voice said “very well, if you’re catholic, tell me, what are the ten commandments” I just read the article once but I don’t understand.

Catholic thoughts on the truths of other world religions ( Nostra Aetate),roaming-buffalo,1622129112,"&gt;Nostra Aetate declared that we should have “sincere reverence” for “those ways of conduct and of life, those precepts and teachings which, though differing in many aspects from the ones she \[the Church\] holds and sets forth, nonetheless often reflect a ray of that Truth which enlightens all men. Indeed, she proclaims, and ever must proclaim Christ ‘the way, the truth, and the life’ (John 14:6).”  
So the great, durable religions of mankind, such as Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, and Hinduism, are not just the product or expression of the cultures in which they were engendered. Nor are they simply the product of “artistic” or moral thinking. They are the product of properly religious insight, which is its own particular and unique way of seeing into the way of things. This unique “religious intuition” or “religious sense” has created the most lasting and important human artifacts, by shaping millions upon millions of human lives over many centuries.

The street vs. the sanctuary,roaming-buffalo,1622127705,"&gt;There must be free and open passage between the sanctuary and the street. We must destroy within ourselves our present feeling that we descend to a lower level when we leave the song of the angels and the archangels and begin to study economic conditions, questions of wages, hours and housing. It is hard, very hard, but it must be done. It must be done not only for the sake of the street, but for the sake of the sanctuary, too. If the Real Presence of Christ in the Sacrament obscures the Omnipresence of God in the world, then the Sacrament is idolatrous, and our worship is actual sin, for all sin at its roots is the denial of the Omnipresence of God.

Cause of atheism/ unbelief,TheKingsPeace,1622123607,"I was just reading ( yet another!) poll about the lack of religious belief among  millennials. Apparently only 55% even identify as Christians, although the number is likely lower then that.

I can’t help but ponder the reason, and think my own experiences as a lapsed Catholic/ unbeliever might be helpful.

I think people often end up gravitating toward whatever philosophy/ religion suits their lifestyle/ way of being the most.

The fact is, Christianity is an extremely inconvenient belief system to hold. It says there’s an all powerful ultimate authority figure who cannot be challenged or questioned ultimately and, He has a specific set of precepts that have to be obeyed.

Catholicism is far worse then normal Christianity, given it’s obligations on mass attendance, sexual ethics, concern for others etc.

Basically when you become Christian ( but especially Catholic) you end up inconveniencing yourself in a massive way and end up giving a lot of “ fun” activities.

I doubt a majority of millennials were convinced by Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens that God didn’t exist ( though many probably get a kick out of him).

Catholic teaching on homosexuality is not monolithic,bearcrk,1622115856,"I used to get tripped up on this all the time. I had - and still have - plenty of LGBTQ friends, and would ask myself the question ""If they are happy, how could it possibly be wrong?"" And for a long time, this thought process caused me to teeter on the edge of belief and unbelief. This all changed when I realized something important: 

the Church's teaching on homosexuality is not monolithic. 

Here's what I mean: the teaching on homosexuality flows naturally out of its teachings on sexuality and sexual behavior in general. The same reason that masturbation, sodomy, and contraception is wrong, is the reason that homosexuality is wrong. Not because the people who engage in it are evil - we are all guilty of some sexual sin - but because it is divorced from the primary purpose of sex, which is the unification of married couples and the potential creation of new life. Any sexual act outside of these things is, by its nature, selfish and masturbatory. 

If you were married, receiving a ""handjob"" from your wife might be somewhat unitive, but its ultimate purpose is one thing only: you getting off. The same is generally true of ""gay sex"", (which as Catholic Answers apologist Trent Horn points out - is not really ""sex"" at all). 

God created 2 genders. And these 2 genders only make sense in context of the other. Reproductive organs only make sense in context of the other sex. The fact that man and woman are made for unity with each other is overwhelmingly obvious in the face of biological and evolutionary fact. Only when approaching some secular sentimentalism about people's feelings do we somehow arrive at the idea that ""heterosexuality"" (a term we should discard as its purpose is to create separate-and-equal categories between modes of sexual behavior) - is societal. 

The church understands that homosexuality is not a choice, but a non-negligible desire by people with same-sex attraction. The church understands that asking these people to a live of chastity or denying union with same-sex partners is emotionally taxing - but so are many other things the church calls us to do. Following Christ was never going to be easy.",Catholicism

Anyways to cut this story short my eleven year old self was kind of like those asshole militant atheists you find in the dark corners of the internet who don't just not have a religion but don't respect others either.

And so I didn't end up getting confirmed.

But for a long time lately I've been feeling Called by the Lord and when I think about Him I feel this happiness.

But I worry about being accepted in the Catholic community, especially after my actions as a child (which involve calling said bad CCD teacher a bitch though apparently the other CCD teachers told my mom that they thought it was hilarious because that teacher \*was\* a bitch).

I'm sure a lot of you have heard of Vladimir Solovyov, who was a kind of crypto-Catholic and wanted the end of the schism between Catholicism and Orthodoxy. He also wrote about mysticism and sophiology, the dangers of modernism, materialism and rationalism and was Dostoyevsky's inspiration for Alyosha in the Brothers Karamazov. At the center of his philosophy is the relationship between man (both as an individual and as a collective) and God and the all-unity. According to Solovyov, this all-unity encompassing the cosmos is based on creation. Despite the fall of man, it is preserved in divine wisdom and effective in individual and social life. The goal of the development of the world is the regaining of the all-unity with the Creator. Solovyov's philosophy of history is determined by the model of a “free theocracy”, which is realized in that humanity subordinates itself to the divine will, guided by the church. In the Catholic Church, Solovyov saw the moral force that defended Christian principles more clearly than Orthodoxy and Protestantism.",Catholicism

After ignoring the news for a while, but still catching a glimpse of the headlines blaring out about the messy issues going on, not limiting to the current pandemic, including armed conflict, so-called ""systemic racism"" and cancel culture, I have decided to make this post to let whoever reads this feel a sense of serenity and not feel affected by the secular-based problems going on.

Even if we are to see the problems, issues, and unhappiness that abounds in the world at various times, the key thought is to remember that God is in control of it all. He may not usually directly interfere, but God cares about each of us, even non-believers. The Lord has taught me,

God created the world to be good. Yes, nobody is perfect, and the world is not perfectly good. But through it all, all goodness flows directly from God. He supports our strengths and even in our lowest points, God is with us.

I want to especially speak for those who may have experienced anxiety or depression. Even though it has been a rough time since the Covid-19 affected our lives, God is always ready to comfort and to be a loving and benevolent guide when we ask Him.

And though we Christians do not ""belong to the world"", as the New Testament proclaims, we are a part of it. The world isn't necessarily bad, but many parts of it has been led astray by Satan himself. He loves division, he loves hate, and he loves to create strife among God's creation.

Question about Latin translation,Soonerpalmetto88,1622078206,"Hi,

I'm wondering if anyone here has a working knowledge of Latin. I took it in high school but apparently what I learned in 2004 didn't stick. I want to translate the following phrase: ""What wondrous love is this?"" 

I assume caritas is the proper word to use for love in the context of Christ's love for humanity, I know mirabilis is wondrous. So I know the words but I'm pretty sure ""quid mirabilis caritas hic"" is incorrect because I don't remember anything about declensions/conjugations. 

I'm getting a sacred heart tattoo and I want to get the phrase ""what wondrous love is this?"" along with the heart itself, which ties into the Divine Mercy novena and one of my favorite hymns. I'm getting the tattoo on my right inner forearm so I'll have a permanent reminder to force me to think before I engage in sinful behavior.

"Can we consider the Furqan as ""Scripture""?",Joshy2004194II,1622074672,"Greetings, everyone!

Someone asked this question and I thought y'all might be able to answer it better than me,AmusedRedPanda,1622074537,""" Since Catholics reject the total depravity of mankind, limited atonement and double predestination as heretical, how can Augustine be considered a saint when he explicitly taught these things?

After reading City of God I have started in on all of Augustine’s works and my Christianity is becoming more and more Augustinian by the minute. In De providentia Augustine writes that God actively pushed some parents whose babies were going to die to baptize their child so that baby would go to heaven while actively blocking other parents in the same circumstance from baptizing their child so that the baby would go to hell; and beyond the question of the fate of dead babies says that God essentially micromanages every aspect of creation down to the moment when a leaf falls from a tree, including the hearts and minds and circumstances of every person so that some are pulled into the church and thus salvation and others and pushed away from the church and toward damnation. That is double predestination and limited atonement, and the Catholic Church named those as heresies in their condemnations of the Calvinists and the Jansenists.

It’s my understanding that those who the RCC sees as unrepentant heretics can’t be saints, which is why Origen and Tertullian aren’t called saints despite their enormous significance in the development of Christian theology and the early Church. Why then is Augustine a saint, and not just a saint but one of less than 40 Doctors of the Church?""",Catholicism
Morality Question: I have taken old e-waste computers.,SnooJokes3820,1622074536,"Hello everyone!

I have been wondering the whether this act is moral or not:

When my family and I go to the dump/recycling center, I sometimes go into the computer waste section and take old computers or computer parts.

To give some context, the recycling center *does* get paid for the electronics as they are stripped and melted back down into metals. This means that the computers are worth some money. In what I have taken there might have been 20$ worth of gold, if that. And the center does definitely not get paid 20$ for what I took.

An important comment that I should make is that I am repurposing these computers and their respective parts for different reasons. Some of them I just use personally as a hobby and for fun, or I will make something cool out of them. Others I will give the parts to people who need them (let's say I go to fix someone's computer, I will also upgrade it for free.) And recently I have been using the hard drives for a type of crypto mining and giving some of the profit to my church (in standard currency).

I was wondering, based on what I have said here if this act is moral or not moral. Is it steeling, am I breaking the 10 commandments? I do know that the end doesn't justify the means, so what do you think.

Thanks,

Asking for a friend. What if you married someone you didn’t love?,DependentShirt8089,1622073009,"I have this friend who is now a faithful Catholic.  

He got married in the Church to a good Catholic woman.  He had a rough background leading up to his marriage.  Addicted to pornography and generally not cultivating his faith.  His now wife and him had an on again off again relationship.  He admittedly said he stayed with her because he was afraid to be alone.  He also would try and use her in their dating relationship.  He said he had no peace but asked her to Marry him.  Even throughout their marriage prep he felt no peace, and didn’t have much interest in marrying her.  Again he would fall to porn and generally felt confused.  He even told me that he would ask priest in confession if it was ok to marry someone he wasn’t attracted to.

He admittedly had a bunch of problems  but now he is living a chaste life and prays everyday.  I’m really proud of how far he’s come.  We had a serious talk the other day and he felt like telling me his situation with his wife.  He said he didn’t love her.  He knows that he came before the altar and entered into that covenant, but he has a type of buyers remorse and if he could go back with his clear mind he would’ve chosen to stay single.  His feelings are bittersweet because he’s glad he found Christ, but his marriage feels like a burden.  He’s seeking the Catholic response to the situation.

You may or may not be aware but all of those are answered in the Bible.

James 5
&gt;13Is any one of you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone cheerful? He should sing praises. 14Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. 15And the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick. The Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.
&gt;16Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man has great power to prevail.

Any suffering should be offered up to prayer to the Lord. He wants us to depend on Him. Prayer always has to be offered up in faith as it is stated the prayer of a righteous man has great power to prevail.

Struggling with Life related teachings,farmerisland,1622061410,"I'm struggling with understanding why the Church has such leniency for usage of the birth control pill, all in the name of double effect. So, I know plenty of good Catholic women, my wife included, who have used the pill to regulate their menstrual cycle to be less painful/irregular and/or greatly aid their hormonal acne issue. But the thing is, that birth control pill, regardless of their ""main intention"", still does prevent Life! These women, once they get married and decide they want to start having kids, then make the (sometimes hard) choice to go off the pill and suffer the acne again or other hormonal issues so that they can get pregnant. My point is, because the choose to take the pill knowing that it ALSO prevents pregnancy, even if not their intention, and then later making the conscious choice to stop taking the pill in order to NOT prevent pregnancy any longer.... I mean, I just don't see why the Church is so okay with this. I'm asking honestly for some clarification, because I truly am struggling with this..... Mostly... Mostly for the reason that I'm now going to list in conjunction...

On the flip side of ""creating Life vs preventing it""... Why is the Church so staunchly firm on her views of IUI (and to a lesser degree, IVF), when these processes can literally be what finally allows a good and faithful Catholic married couple struggling with infertility to finally finally get pregnant and create Life? Now, I already understand the basic overall reason of why the Church forbids IVF and IUI etc., but then, why is a couple dealing with infertility testing allowed to test the male sperm, as long as the sample is obtained through natural sexual intercourse with his spouse, through the special manner? Everything I've read says that is allowed for Catholic married couples, but then why is IUI not allowed when a sperm sample would be obtained the same way, through intercourse (the married sexual act) first? And pushing the blinds a bit here, but why not again in the same way with IVF even? Again, only as long as the sample was obtained through the sexual act? I realize conception would not be happening at the exact same time as the sexual act, so there has been the argument that there is the separation.... But again to my whole question... Why is the Church teaching so staunch and firm on this issue, when involving something so wonderful and good as creating life, in contrast to having an arguably easy ""workaround"" through ""claiming double effect"" for the prevention of life with the birth control pill?

Catholic Church and money,TickTack3,1622059688,"Hi everyone.

Today I met with someone I know (person X). We talked about a lot of things in general and then we came to topic of money.

X's view on the world is in my opinion pretty narrow. He thinks, that every man's ultimate goal is to get as much money as possible with any means necessary - legal and illegal. If a man is very rich, he is probably corrupt, drug addict, in control of high-ranked officials etc.

Yes, I know that a lot of rich people are/were corrupt and are/were included in illegal activities (Jeffrey Epstein, Allen Standford, Donald Trump etc.).

However he also knows that I am religious so he brougth up Catholic Church. In his eyes, Vatican is nothing more than another ultra rich company (Vatican LLC), full of people like the ones mentioned above.

If I tried to explain him, that almost all of Vatican income goes into hospitals (Catholic Church is the greatest non-government health care provider), education infrastructure, churches, support for priests and other people working for Catholic Church etc., unlike rich people, who have too much money and nothing to care about, except for their pleasure, he would still bring up ""the hidden from the public part of Vatican"".

I would really like If you guys could give me a good response to his views.

Mono-polytheism is my understanding of this heretical.,Mlg_Rauwill,1622056803,"Hello my fellow catholic,

I've been posting on here a bit as of recent, and I wondered if I could share a view which I think may be slightly heterodox. But I wanted your guys take on it, because I see most people here aren't some weird wishy washy Christian. Any ways, here's my start. We've all heard the classic atheist line, ""I just believe in one less god then you"" line of argument. But here's my thinking. I see the pagan gods as modes of being which manifest themselves in the world. For example Athena is the god of wisdom, so those who worship Athena will prize the accumulation of knowledge as their highest goal or aspiration. We see this in Athens as Athena is considered the state patriarch of Athens. Ares was the patriarch of Sparta, and he was the god of war and raw strength. Which is why Sparta tended to prize strength. In order to offer up their prayers to these gods Athens would construct places of learning and Sparta would create super soldiers essentially, to praise them. 

Okay now for the second part, why can't any of these gods be on the same ontological level as the God. Because wisdom or intelligence cannot be the highest praised virtue in a culture without it devolving into chaos. People will start to persecute lesser intelligent people, and will create a super weird inverted society. Even human happiness cannot be the highest god, because then we will see weird measures be taken into account like directly pumping dopamine into our brain or something like that. In fact the pagans thought God was so high up that he wanted nothing to do with humanity.

The Christian answer in my understanding is that actually this isn't true, and God has revealed himself, and the mode of being he embodies in love. I also will use the definition of Love which Saint Maximus gives which is preserving unity within multiplicity. To love something is to make it's particularity shine without overwhelming it. I mean we do this with our friends and family all the time, when we try to build them up, but don't overwhelm their sense of choice with our particularity. I also see this in the trinity where the hypostasis of God are completely separate yet completely unified. They aren't 1/3 God, no each are fully God, yet each are fully separate. I also think only God can unite the gods so they don't devolve into warring among themselves like they do in Roman mythology. Only under God can they fully submit, without being destroyed.

I know this seems like I'm saying God is just an idea, but that's not it at all. In my ontology or metaphysic or whatever you want to call it, there is no such thing as ideas, these are beings. For something to be a being it needs to have body which I'll define as a nexus of potentiality. Which these ""ideas"" certainly do have body under this definition. And because humans are a union of heaven and earth(i.e able to manifest higher spiritual principles into earthy reality) we host these gods to one extent or another. They have body through us. To quote Carl Jung, ""People don't have ideas, idea have people."" But the only way to break through this so our particularity can shine to its fullest is to connect with God, the infinite, because only in union with him can our particularity truly shine.

Sorry If the way I'm describing it might have been offensive to some people. I was just wondering if this would be considered highly heretical in your guys opinion, because I haven't fully fleshed this out.",Catholicism

She gave it to me however the problem is that the statue is missing the crown and so I ask - Do you think I am allowed to place a new crown upon her head? I have a small toy crown at home which used to serve as a decoration for a pencil I believe, however even though it's kinda greenish, the size is pretty good for the statue. What do you think?

Confession,One_Qwa,1622047423,"I'm not Catholic yet, and I'm not 18 so I can't convert without my parents approval (they are against me being Catholic). I've asked before on this subject about members of eastern Churches receiving Sacraments, which is allowed (although you should probably make sure with a priest if you are thinking about doing it). I'm just worried about how this would work out practically; I think my Confession would take a really, really long time, maybe more than an hour. I don't know how to that without my parents stopping me and if there is even a Priest with that amount of time. I've thought I can just wait until I'm 18, convert and then confess as the Priest might make more time individually with the converts. But I'm worried, I don't know when I'll die or when Jesus will return. I know He loves me and wants me to go to Heaven, He knows my situation but part of me says ""I can go to confession, it's my choice not to because it's too difficult, or I'm scared or shy"".

I know a perfect act of contrition can forgive you of mortal sins, it's just hard to do it and I've tried. And then there's obviously the fact that I have much less assurance of forgiveness.

I know this was more of a rant, I just feel I want to talk about it and possibly get some advice. Also, in my country, the last day for the mandatory Confession during Easter is the 30th of may this year. I don't HAVE to confess and receive The Eucharist, right?",Catholicism

What to expect/what is appropriate in Spiritual Direction with a priest?,Spare_Disaster13,1622045596,"Hello, 

I am going to be going to Spiritual Direction with my parish priest for the first time soon. Background info: female, twenties, and currently in therapy. I don't intend to make this like a counseling session, but I know there is some overlap between psychological and spiritual issues, atleast for me and I don't feel comfortable bringing up issues related to spiritualty with my therapist.

If a sexual past has affected my mental and spiritual life, how should I talk about it? Obviously sorid details wouldn't be appropriate. But I also don't really know what some people consider sorid...I overthink things, so just looking for some advice and suggestions.

"IVF, genetic disease and hell",New_General_6287,1622045481,"Coming from the other IVF thread, I have a more personal issue.

Before i have kids I will certainly have both me and my (if I find one) wife tested genetically to see the chance for the genetic defect to manifest. If the chance of the defect was high enough I would prefer going the IVF route as then you can select the used spermacytes and egg-cells and minimize the risk of the faulty genes being expressed.  


That means that to make sure my child is healthy I would need to commit a sin and because I had committed said sin to ensure the health of my child I would not be able to regret it ever, thus I would not be able to ever again go to confession or repent.

If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.

Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

Marrying outside of your faith,testingpage2025,1622041194,"So I'm orthodox christian, but I personally don't have a problem getting married to someone who is not christian, as long as they agree to get married in the church (probably a catholic church), have our kids baptized and be okay with me taking our kids to church once in a while, until they reach the age where they can decide for themselves whatever they wanna do and/or believe in. I would never want to force my religion onto my spouse or my kids, because that's what my parents and my entire community currently do to me and there's no escaping it at this point. Not that I don't wanna be religious, just wanna be free to marry who I want and to basically live my life without judgment from anyone (except God lol).

But anyways, does my future husband have to get baptized to get married in the church and to have our kids baptized? I doubt it would be in an orthodox church cause it's a long process to get baptized as orthodox, I guess I'm looking at catholic or another type of christianity that's not too far off from orthodox. If they do have to be baptized, what's the easiest way to do it? Is it a long process?

This is just out of curiosity, this is in the case that the person I want to marry wants to convert, even if they're not entirely religious/spiritual, and they would do it all on their own will.

Question(s) about the Church's view of in vitro fertilization (IVF).,GibbNotGibbs,1622040668,"Before I ask my question(s), I will say that I am not a Catholic (I'm an atheist) but I do have an interest in philosophy and theology.

&gt;Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous artificial insemination and fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, yet remain morally unacceptable. They dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act. The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, but one that *""entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children.""*   
&gt;  
&gt;""Under the moral aspect procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not willed as the fruit of the conjugal act, that is to say, of the specific act of the spouses' union. Only respect for the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make possible procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person.""   
&gt;  
&gt;(Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church, 2377.)

The section I have italicized I think is the essence of the Church's argument in opposition to IVF: it separates procreation from intercourse, whereas the two have been designed to function together: sex, between a married man and woman, is designed to transmit life, fulfilling its purpose.

I believe the Church's position may be expressed as the statement P: ""iff S, then T"", where iff is if and only, S is the act of sex (within marriage, etc.) and T is the transmission of life (i.e. procreation). If P is true, then it does follow that all new life must be the consequence of intercourse, so the Catholic teaching in this area is logically sound.

However, I am not sure what justifies the use of ""iff"" rather than ""if"" in this context. If we consider the statement Q: ""if S, then T"", then if Q is true, all S must lead to T, but T can be caused by things other than S (namely IVF rather than intercourse). So how has the Church concluded that P rather than Q (or any other position) is the sound one?

Of course, Scripture has nothing to say about the issue of IVF directly, so theologians must infer from the text what the proper Christian teaching on this matter is. In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul says ""I wish that all were as I myself am,"" meaning that he thought celibacy was better than being sexually active, even if that activity occured within a marriage. So surely IVF would be a good way of fulfilling the commandment to ""go forth and multiply"" in light of the fact that celibacy is a more godly way of life?

And regarding the matter of ""entrusting the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors..."", it seems to me that this happens to one degree or another irrespective of the use or lack thereof of IVF. Many mothers will recieve antenatal healthcare in order to ensure the welfare of both the mother and child, but very few people would argue that recieving such support (after conceiving the child naturally and within marriage) somehow diminishes the mother's central role in the development of the unborn child. Equally, I struggle to see how couples that have chosen to undergo IVF have in any way augmented ""the powers of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technolgy"" (and doing so while diminishing the role of the mother).

And the issue of destiny is brought up, but could it not be the case that God would rather see new life brought into the world, having been conceived through IVF, than he would that new life not be born at all? What leads the Church to conclude that ""destiny of the human person"" as it pertains to conception is for this to occur only as a consequence of marital and sexual relations?

I didn't expect this post to be nearly as long as it has turned out to be, but I look forward to hearing your insights on this issue.",Catholicism

"Fellow Catholics who are exclusively TLM attendees, could you return to the NO?",Breifne21,1622037704,"Just wondering if any one else felt like me. I have exclusively attended the TLM for the better part of two decades now, and remember the days before Summorum Pontificum. With the rumors swirling that Pope Francis may abrogate Summorum Pontificum, it made me think what it would be like to have to return to those days.

For my own part, I simply could not go back to being a regular NO attendee. It feels completely foreign to me, and whenever I go now, if I have a funeral or a wedding to attend for example, I usually have no idea whats going on, am usually scandalized by something or another, and I leave feeling completely bewildered. I literally feel more at home in an Orthodox Church than I do at the regular Novus Ordo. 

Now, I wish to clarify. I do believe that the Novus Ordo is a valid liturgy etc. but most of it is so totally alien to me that I could never become a regular attendee again. I'm 30 years old, but when I look at the other people at my church who are younger than I, and maybe were raised exclusively in the TLM, the idea that they could ever be assimilated into the Novus Ordo parish down the street is unthinkable, I honestly think many would lose their faith.",Catholicism
Why are Catholics downplaying the horrors of Hell?,the_Jorbus,1622037093,"I remember having my first panic attack at 7 years old. It was at a mass, when I learned about the eternal flames of Hell. I lived the next few weeks in despair, ultimately arriving at our Lord.

Like it or not, Hell exists and it is infinitely worse than any pain you can feel on Earth *and it is eternal.*

My fellow Catholics, **stop watering down Hell**. 

It all started with Limbo. People are too weak to accept that unbaptized babies, stained by original sin, will be thrown into the eternal flames of Hell. God is good, but he is also **just.** Limbo is heresy.

In *The Soul and It's Origin*, Saint Augustine declared ""**let no one promise infants who have not been baptized a sort of middle place of happiness between damnation and Heaven**, for this is what the Pelagian heresy promised them.""

Also, invincible ignorance is heresy. Atheists, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, etc. **are going to Hell**, end of story. God is written on all of our hearts and they have chosen their fate.

It doesn’t make you feel good, I know, but your feelings are irrelevant. The Truth does not care about your feelings.

Stop telling people “we don’t know if there is anybody in Hell it’s up to God.” Yes, we don’t know exactly 100% *who* is in Hell, but if you read scripture you can know that there are indeed **a lot of people currently in the eternal flames of Hell.**

An open letter to all from a fellow Catholic: A confession to all,Bedroom_Sweet,1622034000,"Good day to all Catholics. What I may say can be considered a message of distress and might be offensive to some. However, I should be direct since I want this message to reach as many people as possible.

First and foremost, I have done some analysis on the message from seers about the world coming to an end. The chaos of all forms shall befall humanity like the world has never seen. However, what worries me the most is the message of more Catholics not making it to Heaven than those who managed to make it. The main reason cited was the lack of reparations made despite numerous instances of confessions and the tendency of falling back to the wrong ways which were confessed. So, I would like to talk through experience on why this message grieves me heavily. 

My world fell into an utter standstill when I obtained the message the world would come to an end. It was very hard to accept to think that you can no longer fulfil the dreams of your childhood. It hits me particularly hard that I would not make it to see many eventually. The correct concept of confession is a renewed heart and a period of confession is as long as you live in the time of mercy of God, not when leaving the church. The **lack of reparation** is what manages to make people sin again, not mainly the temptations of the devils. Too many times, I find myself sinning because I was **not in a state of forgiveness, but rather a state of void, a feeling of nothingness**. Yes, I did not commit a sin but I also did nothing to improve myself spiritually from that standpoint. That is the reason why I could not free myself from the bondage of pornography that plagued my soul for five years, up to today. I do have the commitment to refrain from sin, but where I failed to understand is that confession is a phrase of life change and continuous learning to change. Sure, I did change and understand the destruction pornography can do to the soul. If so, why the repeat of such a harmful influence for a long time? I may have the answer, the **rationalization of sin to reduce its magnitude**. It is used to excuse my aggressive behaviour, profane vocabulary, cursing others, subjugating others, fight others and mainly, being an outright manipulator and hypocrite. I finally came to my senses not mainly on the world ending, but Jesus was merciful to hint me that I should stop my facade. It is not right to put God aside to please the world. It hurts to think that we live in a world that talking about faith and God is considered ""not appropriate"". We have normalised sin to the rate it continuously nullifies the sacrifice that Jesus died on the cross on Calvary for our sins. 

However, it is through these sins I understand something. It was detrimental to the soul, but to me, it is instrumental to share my experience with other fellows Catholics. Sure, I am a weak soul and it sounds hypocritical to preach about salvation while being a repeated sinner, but I wanted more of you to know that this world would not last long as much I very much desire to see it progress and I pray I can trust Catholics would understand the sacrament of confession is more than a sacrament, it is a phase to change with efforts put into reparation and forgiveness. I am no miracle worker, I am just sharing with all of you all my experience and my lasting battle to fight my bondage. So, pray for me so that I can change as I pray for the salvation of all Christians to keep fighting not for what is right in the eyes of this world but the will of God, the Father.",Catholicism

I was wondering what your opinions were on these statements, my opinion lies somewhere in the middle, I believe we should always keep our faith in mind but I think certain situations require you to act against it.

Why is homosexualism not welcomed in most Christian denominations especially in Catholic church?,Leading-Reporter-848,1622012461,"I know that decent Christians do not hate homosexuals, but maybe homosexual activities. And I know Catholic church never hates or exclude homosexual people. However, I don't know why most Christian denominations including Catholic church say homosexual activities are evil and are sins.

My girlfriend is an avocate of LGBTQ rights and believes that their sexual activities are never evil but should be supported. (She is an atheist and I try to persuade her sometimes) I said I don't really think sodomy can be blessed like sex between a responsible couple of a man and a woman has in trust.

I know the bible says it so. Paul says homosexual activities are shameful things, and old testaments even curse people who have sodomy saying ""they should be put to death"". But... I feel like if it is right to say homosexual people who love each other and have sex are evil and I should not blees it.

Plus, I also do not know why it is wrong to have sex with my girlfriend without marriage, even though sex is very important in a relationship and I am seriously considering marrying her and I will take all my responsibilities if accidently she gets my baby in her womb. Even if I marry her, Catholic church would say sex is evil if I wear a condom. How is this also right?

"This may be an odd question, but would a church welcome an atheist (or agnostic I guess) to confession?",TuvixWasMurderedR1P,1622012035,"I’ve never been baptized, nor am I even terribly familiar with all of the tenets of the church. My grandparents were Catholics though. My grandmother was particularly very religious and spiritual. Whether it was through Grace or explained through some psychological reasons, I did see that her faith gave her a strength Ive admired. It’s been years since she passed. 

When I was little I have my grandma a little teddy bear with angel wings and a halo which she kept above her bed. Upon her passing I’ve been given the bear back. I’ve also felt compelled to keep it by my bed. Perhaps it’s meaningless and silly, but it brings me comfort. 

As I began to keep the teddy angel by my bed, I’ve taken an intellectual interest in the history of the church and in the life and philosophy of Saint Augustine. But this intellectual interest seems to *perhaps* be evolving into a spiritual interest as well.

Though I could learn a lot through books and the internet, for whatever reason I feel that I should speak to a priest. The only problem is I’m still in a state of quite radical doubt.

My question is simple but it's requires a comprehensive and long answer (although I will be content with an overview), so I'll be equally happy with a redirection to some reading material. That said, I basically want to know what the main sects and churches were before the Reformation and everything related to that (e.g. ""Roman Catholic"", ""Latin"", ""the great schism"", etc.).

Anyone else share these very narrow sentiments on Atheism with me?,avashad,1621987295,"Alright I know these are unfair generalizations and will be incorrect for most atheists but this is just my gut instinct/thoughts when I first encounter an atheist. 

1. I usually assume their dad was an asshole that was either also an atheist and paraded an arrogant atheism around the house their entire life or was very religious and shoved religion down their throat and eventually pushed them away. 

2. Also, usually when a male is atheist, it comes to me as no big surprise and kind of makes sense and typical that a dude would get so full of himself that he gets to a point of not imagining the possibility of a higher being. I’m a guy by the way.

3. But when a female is atheist it seems way darker to me like something must’ve went terribly wrong for this to happen. Like some sort of abuse or who knows. Maybe it sounds sexist but I feel like I would have a way tougher time trusting a female atheist than a male atheist.

"""Experimenting"" With Catholicism?",iwantcheemsburbger,1621986766,"Hello everyone,

Not sure if this would be disrespectful to the religion in any way, but I don't think it's against the rules so I'll post it here. My family was never very religious, my dad is an atheist and my mom believes in a god but doesn't follow a specific religion. Needless to say, we never went to church at all and around middle school I had a lot of questions that I didn't feel were satisfactorily answered, and so I became an atheist. Even then, I've always had a sort of pull towards Christianity, though I couldn't really explain why that was. It was usually in the form of some question I had about it that would make me want to research it, and I usually found an answer that favored an atheist point of view and would call it a day. I've also felt that regardless of what religion I end up following, I would want devote my life to it, be it as a Buddhist monk or a Catholic priest.

So, I want to sort of try out Catholicism. I already kind of believe in at least some sort of God just because I would find it harder to believe that the universe came about as a result of any of the other scientific theories, so at least I have that part down haha. I'm unsure of whether I not I believe in Jesus and everything regarding him, so would that make it inappropriate to pray to God regardless?

Why can’t we have a modern version of the story of Elijah and the Prophets of Baal?,Caramal76,1621973244,"Basically if you don’t know what happened: Elijah and some prophets of Baal essentially entered into a contest to prove which God was real.

Elijah prayed to God and a fire came down and consumed the offering for everyone to see. The people fell on their faces crying out worship for God.

So why doesn’t this happen today? What a great testament to the truth and power of God. I imagine the Pope himself calling down a miracle while the world watched and all see that God reigns supreme and isn’t like the Gods of the Hindus, or the Pagans, or any other false gods. 

Is such a thing possible today? Would God still be willing to do this or is that something only allowed in the past?

When I did the slides for that Mass, it always seemed off to me because English would say one thing and Spanish another.

English - We love You God, and we praise You  
Spanish - All hail Jerusalem. Alleluia!

See what I mean? Different. But I was always told to just let them do their thing. 

Just before COVID hit, we had a new priest come to our parish as the liturgical coordinator. When we returned to indoor worship, he asked me to start making the PowerPoints, after I brought to his attention what is going on.

They do not mean the same thing. Also, the book they had, they never used for note reference, they only used the words. So there wouldn't be any issue now, right?

Not Catholic, but have a question that is related to Catholicism/Catholic history I was hoping someone might be able to help me with.

When I was in college (15 years ago) I attended a lecture called the Bible and English Literature.  I don't remember much about it except that we read parts of both Testaments, and Waiting for Godot.  I also got a mediocre grade, which I was bummed about.  But that's beside the point.

I distinctly remember one day, the professor told us that in the Catholic Church––in what specific era, I'm not sure, but I believe it was pre-20th century––female adherents were encouraged to consider Jesus's suffering on a somatic level (i.e. to *feel* the wounds, to imagine the physical pain), whereas male Catholics were asked to intellectualize the crucifixion.

I am in so much pain right now, emotionally. 2 weeks ago I was heartbroken about a girl, now I'm crying for my cat who I raised since she was a kitten.

I know that some of you don't believe that animal's will have entrance to heaven, but please still pray for the soul of my cat, Arya. I know God loves all of his creations, and maybe there is a chance I'll still see my pets in the next life.

Also please pray for me. I am currently depressed. I treat my pets like they're my children. Losing Arya, left a hole in my heart. I am questioning myself, what's it all for? Why work, why eat, why get up in the morning, if we're all going to lose everything we love in the future.

I know that everything happens for a reason, but why does an innocent creature have to die. Please help me understand why bad things happen to us. Is it because I get distracted when praying, is it because of my sins in the past, is it because I only attend online mass due to COVID?",Catholicism

"First Mass True Attendance, Plus a Question on Tithing?",princessp15,1621949575,"I have attended Mass before, but I attended it this past Sunday morning with a new perspective (thanks to several Redditors!). While I didn't participate in any kneeling or communion or reciting prayers, I did focus intently, prayed, listened, and tried to learn. I really felt at peace several times during Mass - something I haven't felt in my own church in years, but that may be because I was very intentional with my time and purpose for being there. 

I am going to continue working on learning the different prayers and trying to learn more about the faith in general. I am going to start going to early Mass on Sundays, and continue going to my church immediately after (I attend there with my parents, I teach a Sunday School class, I co-direct VBS and we're about at that time of year, and I just have several responsibilities I can't put off). I really feel like Catholicism is where I'm being called, but I plan on attending both churches until VBS is over at my church (first week of August). At that time, I plan to start learning about the process of transitioning fully.

On a different note - I currently tithe 10% of my gross pay to my church each week. Any donations I make are on top of that - as in, I don't take away from the 10% when I donate money or things to church causes. My monetary ""donations"" aren't a whole lot though, maybe an extra $300-400 a year (buying things for my Sunday school kids, etc). What is the proper way to tithe within Catholicism?",Catholicism

Deeply conflicted and angry all the time when thinking about the faith,cassiewassiecampbell,1621943261,"I grew up Catholic and I still am, I just cannot go to church or pray without overthinking things and coming out of it angry and depressed. 

I can’t even fulfill the most basic step of Christianity, which is to love your neighbor. I do like a lot of people and will generally be able to easily love someone if they’re nice (I love 99% of the people I’ve actually met), but the internet makes this so hard. The majority of people, at least in the west, are such degenerates now that they can hide behind a screen, it’s so hard for me not to hate them. The best piece of advice I got for this is to remember that humans are made in the image and likeness of God, but if God is anything like humans, I don’t think I want anything to do with Him. 

I also feel a lot of resentment towards God Himself for making me. I feel really bad saying it, since I am extremely prolife, but I really would have been better off if I hadn’t been born. I’m just useless even when I try to help. I can’t even procreate or even raise adopted children since it seems that God is pushing me to be single despite my severe loneliness. It really seems like I was designed with no purpose. I feel like I wasn’t even knitted in the womb, but God just tied some yarn together, threw it in there, and hoped it would come out okay. 

I’ve pretty much ranted all my feelings out for now, but they’ll come back later. Is it a sin to think any of these things? What do I do to get rid of these thoughts? I’m an 18 year old girl, for reference, so I don’t know if that’s common for my group (doesn’t seem to be at least). It’s getting exhausting trying to pray everyday and feeling so angry and hopeless for hours, sometimes the whole day, afterwards.",Catholicism

However there are more than one types of teaching that goes out and calls themselves Christians but won't believe the Lord's own words.

For one brief example which won't be the premise of the post. There are denominations out there that deny Him being God.
John 10
&gt;30I and the Father are one.” 

John 1:1
&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God…

And there are denominations  that deny the Godhood of the Holy Spirit
Genesis
&gt;2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

John 14 
&gt;15“If you love Me, [keep My commandments. 16And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another [Helper, that He may abide with you forever— 17the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you. 18I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.

But even ignoring that the most important are those that deny Hell's existence, deny it's purpose, deny the eternality of it, and most importantly deny everything Jesus said about Hell.
Almost everything we know about Hell comes from Jesus Christ through parables and explicit speech but somehow a majority of the world is okay with creating narratives that range from it not being eternal to it being only for the devil. None of these narratives are anywhere in scripture. This is what Jesus says about hell.

Revelation 21:8 
&gt;But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”

The faithless are apart of all the sinners. You will see it said that God would not punish those who did not believe in Him but that is completely unbiblical and explicitly contradictory to the word.

Matthew 25:46 
&gt;And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”

Eternal punishment and Eternal life. Those are the choices. Nothing about annihilationism.

Revelation 20:10 
&gt;And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

Night and day forever

Revelation 20:15 
&gt;And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
And people not saved go into that same lake

Matthew 5:22 
&gt;But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire.

More verses about LITERAL fire

Matthew 13:50 
&gt;And throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
More fire. Pain. 

And this is the most explicit and complete telling of what Hell will be like for those who do not accept salvation through Jesus Christ

Luke 16:19-31
&gt;19 “There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. 20 And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, 21 who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. 22 The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side.[a] The rich man also died and was buried, 23 and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. 24 And he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.’ 25 But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. 26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’ 27 And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house— 28 for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ 

Let no one deceive you about Hell with false statements about the nature of God or that everyone will be in heaven or that hell is temporary. None of this is in the Bible. These types of statements only serve the devil. He is trying to get you to doubt God like he did with Eve. He wants you to think God is bad again like he did with Eve. And he knows that if you knew how much those around you were in danger of being placed in hell with him you would actively go out and do the great commission that Jesus has given all of us.

It's real easy to sit back and be like the person with the one talent who dug in the ground until Jesus came back but we have to go out there and save souls.

Beautiful place, has a chapel that is kept open 24 hrs so you can pray with Jesus. The last time I stayed I was so close to the chapel, I could see the red latern from the window of the room I was staying at. When I'm there, I work, I pray, I have fun. It all comes to me so easily. I go to sit with Jesus in my breaks, then it's back helping people or prepping participant's meals. Everything has a purpose. I don't even have time to be tempted.

In my parish, I help a lot as well. We are in the smaller side, I even think the building in it of itself is relatively new. Since we don't have stained glass windows, or paintings or a lot built in ornaments, we decorate with flowers, sometimes from our own backyards. I help in the decorating, as well as cleaning and anything else that needs to be done. And I'm happy to do so. We're a loving community so people bring in snacks and share them, they tell jokes, and they give people who come to help, religious medals, rosaries etc. It also means I get time close to Jesus in the blessed sacrament.

But when I come home it's so hard to beat sloth and be productive. I don't pray as much as I should either. I procastinate, waste time, despair. I feel aimless and I fall into sexual temptation. And it sucks.

He is very big on mercy and this is a good thing in my opinion. However, it seems as if some people seem to take this to mean that gay marriage is okay in the church and basically misconstrue his words, even if he hasn't said anything wrong.  So what's one to do about that?

On a more sinister note, what about those who are truly hateful people who use church teachings to justify horrible things. Like for example, when I was a teen I got bullied by a kid who would call me a bunch of gay slurs (for the record, I'm a straight white married man with a one year old daughter) and sometimes he would say things like ""You know the church doesn't like f###"" and would make fun of me for saying I might want to be a priest, mostly due to gay stuff. Now to be fair, this kid was at best a nominal Catholic who mainly went because it was a cultural thing to do where I grew up. Still, lets say that people use the teachings of the church to justify things like bullying or hurting someone or even worse, and its not caused by hateful rhetoric but instead they interpret normal words as a way to sanction their violence. Basically they hear the church is against gay marriage, but somehow think its okay to beat up gay people, or they hear the church is pro life and how horrible abortion is, but then decide to vandalize a clinic or call pro choice people horrible names like baby killer.

A question on forgiveness of sins,5minusone,1621904332,"Hello all ! Question from a curious Catholic about a debate I saw on religion:

So the Second Commandment says this about those who take the name of God in vain:

&gt;For the LORD will not leave unpunished anyone who invokes his name in vain.

And I can understand why this is one of the more serious sins; it's about doing sinful things and saying that you do them in the name of God.

And I've seen others mention other Bible verses such as these:

&gt;Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. Matthew 12:31-32  
&gt;  
&gt;But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation. Mark 3:29  
&gt;  
&gt;But unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven. Luke 12:10

Can a priest use violent force?,DependentShirt8089,1621894250,"This is just a fun thought, but something I started thinking about today. A few scenarios.

Firstly: could a Priest use deadly force in self defense or to protect a third party.  (Keep in mind this scenario would be assuming just war).  Wasn’t sure if they swear anything saying they won’t?

Second theory is a little more crazy, but one that peaks my Cold War fascination 😂. In this scenario a priest would offer his services and access to intelligence for a third party (say the UK, USA, etc) against a nation similar to what the Soviet Union was. He may be asked to take part in an assassination of an evil high level Soviet who is responsible for the murder of thousands.  Again Assuming the attack is morally allowed under just war, Would a priest be allowed to take part in this?

Just a fun little scenario that’s interesting. No need for anyone to get into an argument unless your a willing party.

The Gift of Confession,ZTeam534,1621887499,"I just want to share my last experience with going to the Sacrament of Reconciliation. It is an incredible gift the Lord God has given us. For anyone who is afraid of going, I would just like to share my story to encourage others to go.

The first thing I’d like to share is that I’m nowhere near of being a Saint, but God still has so much love for me and all of us. I have an anxiety disorder and I always feel that I’m so unworthy of receiving God’s forgiveness and mercy. I told my Priest this a few times in the confessional, and he said that the most important thing is that after we screw up is to turn back to Him. God will welcome us with open arms and is ready for us ALWAYS to run back to Him. I always think about and LOVE the parable about him (temporarily) leaving the flock of sheep to find the one lost sheep, because that’s how much He loves us! So know that you are incredibly loved by our Lord Jesus!

The second thing I’d like to address is that there is NOTHING a Priest hasn’t heard, so do not worry about any sins you have! I don’t believe that there is a commandment I HAVEN’T broken, and God has showed His mercy upon me!!As long as you are truly sorry for your wrongdoings, God is ready and wanting to forgive all of us!! And once we ask and do our Penance, God has cleansed us! 

The 3rd thing I’d like to share is my story. I told my Priest (who is a vessel for Jesus in moments) all that I have done, and just telling him that I just want to be done with sin, and the ones that have just chained me down. I told Father that I just desire Jesus and want to do the right thing, and to love and serve Him. I told Him everything that was on my Heart. And Father was so amazing. We talked and his feedback was just absolutely wonderful! Then I said the act of contrition, and was able to celebrate mass shortly after! And what better timing too! It was Pentecost, and I didn’t even know it! What God does may not always make sense to us, but his timing is always PERFECT!

The last thing I’d like to share is I know God is close to me! How? Because Satan has been trying to tear me down, but I won’t let him! I am a child of God, we all are!! God’s Mercy and Love is endless and all we need to do is to accept it! Don’t be afraid of Confession, go take advantage of it!! It’s amazing!

Thank you for reading, and God Bless you all!!!",Catholicism

Problems with Aquinas and the Will,Mlg_Rauwill,1621885249,"This is my first time posting on here in a while, but there's something I've been wrestling with when it comes to Aquinas as of late. I watched a talk by David Bentley Hart a while ago where he talks about freedom and Nihilism, I'll link the video below. The conclusion Hart comes to is that Nihilism has arisen directly as result from the changing of our definition of what freedom is. He first starts with the definition of freedom as the ability to do no evil. He continues by saying God is the only thing which is absolute free because the ability to choose evil would be a defect in God. Because God is the fullness of the true, the good, and the beautiful. He moves onto then the modern conception of freedom which is the imposition of the will, the ability to make my will manifest in the world. He then shows how especially in the work of William of Ockham what becomes primary in God is his ability to impose his will on the world. For example, What God wills is ultimately good because God has choose it. Which is distinct from God cannot choose evil because that would be a defect in God. I see this largely as finding it's origin in Aquinas, when he speaks of the will. Love is an act of the will. I see this road directly leads us to Nihilism, because God just becomes arbitrary. How do we fight against this, or am I just misreading Aquinas?",Catholicism

If we are prone to flaws like jealousy or coveting will we go to heaven?,DependentShirt8089,1621882151,"I, like all humans, have my own cross to carry.  I confess my sins, go to mass, and pray that these things go away.

I’m having conflict with my feelings and what I know is right.  I guess my question is: Having feelings of jealousy or coveting, while not good, are just feelings?

"Really struggling with confessing ""kind and number."" I don't know how much detail is needed. I'm overwhelmed.",StartsRandomConvos,1621880170,"I'm tying to make a general confession for about 30 years of awful, awful sins.

I've written down just about all of my sins.  As of right now, it would take well over an hour to confess everything.  I don't know how to trim it down.

All the details I've written down seem relevant to me, so I don't know how to make it shorter.

The Council of Trent says:

&gt; We gather furthermore, that **those circumstances which change the species of the sin** are also to be explained in confession, because that, without them, the sins themselves are neither entirely set forth by the penitents, nor are they known clearly to the judges; and it cannot be that they can estimate rightly the grievousness of the crimes, and impose on the penitents, the punishment which ought to be inflicted, on account of them.

Examples of things I'm struggling with:

1) blasphemous thoughts against God (that I definitely assented to).  Is it enough to say ""I had blasphemous thoughts 50 times,"" or do I need to say what the thoughts actually were.  Some of them were truly horrific.  I feel like I *have* to confess each and every detail of those (it would sure take a weight off my shoulders, anyway).

2) Lying.  For several years, I basically lived a double life and scammed a bunch of people, including family.  It takes me a good 5 minutes to explain the situation so that it makes sense.  Then 5 more minutes to explain a couple other very elaborate webs-of-lies I created.  Surely it can't be enough to say, ""I told 1,000s of elaborate lies for 5 years,"" can it?

3) Seriously neglected the duties of my state in life.  Takes a couple minutes to list them.

4) Insulted the Church.  Takes a good minute to describe the ways in which I did this.

5) Disrespected parents.  Takes a couple minutes.

6) Failed to protect others.  There are a few times I noticed hazards that could endanger other people, but I didn't warn anyone.  And it seems to me that noticing a downed powerline and not reporting it is a different species than seeing some motor oil on some public stairs and not reporting it.  Wouldn't I have to describe these details?

7) Everything I've stolen.  (This examination)[http://pope-speaks.com/?page_id=534] says this about the 7th and 10th Commandments:

&gt;Throughout this whole examination you must not merely tell the number of sins, you must also tell, as nearly as possible, the value of what you took, or the amount of damage caused by your injustice, that the confessor may know whether your sins are mortal or not, and what restitution you have to make.

I take that to mean I have to explain each individual time I stole something - the priest would have to know if each theft was mortal or not, and depending on who I stole from, the restitution might be different (eg, donating the stolen money to charity instead of trying to pay back some giant faceless corporation).

And so on.  It all adds up.  I don't know where to remove detail.  It seems like it all changes the species of the sin.

**Finally, I don't know what to do about ""number.""**  Eg, I used drugs for many years, but some years weren't as bad as others.  Do I need to go into the detail of how often I used?  Do I need to break it down like this, for example: ""age 18-22 - smoked marijuana 4 times a week; age 23-27 - smoked it once a week; age 28-37 - smoked it twice a year.""  Do I have to do a similar breakdown for pornography/masturbation, as some years I did it a lot, some years I didn't?  I also happened to see a video of a priest talking about confession, and he said you have to confess when the last time was that you committed the particular sin, so the priest knows the state of your soul (eg, ""I last smoked marijuana 4 years ago"").

What if I truly don't know how many times I committed a sin?  Eg, envious thoughts.  Can I just say ""thousands of times over the course of 30 years""?  I don't know how I could possibly come close to a true estimate.  Another example: ""In conversation, I said that I supported the right to abortion.""  Maybe I said this 50 times in my life.  Maybe 100.  Maybe 500. I honestly don't know.  What do I say for number?

Feast of Our Lady Help of Christians,MerlynTrump,1621878873,"So, I know today is the Feast of Mary Mother of the Church, a new moveable feast (technically a memorial) Pope Francis created in 2018 to be celebrated the day after Pentecost. But May 24 is historically the Feast of Our Lady Help of Christians. I was thinking that the new feast would supercede the old one this year, but when I check [Romcal.net](https://Romcal.net) for 2022 (I also checked 2020 but May 24 was a Sunday that year) it just has May 24 as a regular/feria day (Tuesday of the Sixth Week of Easter).

Looking at Wikipedia ( [Mary Help of Christians - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Help_of_Christians) ) it says (citing the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913) that the feast of Our Lady Help of Christians ""has spread nearly over the entire Latin Church, but is not contained in the universal calendar"". However the same Wikipedia article also mentions that in 2007 Pope Benedict XVI instituted it as a feast for persecuted Chinese Catholics, who venerate Our Lady Help of Christians at the Shrine of Our Lady of Sheshan and declared May 24 to be the World Day of Prayer for the Church in China (this prayer can be found on the Holy See's website  [World Day of Prayer for the Church in China, 24 May 2008 - Prayer to Our Lady of Sheshan (May 15, 2008) | BENEDICT XVI (vatican.va)](http://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/prayers/documents/hf_ben-xvi_20080515_prayer-sheshan.html)

Husband wants to join... but it feels... awkward and insincere?,jaydeke,1621872542,"Basically what the title says. I was confirmed and entered the faith as an adult in my 20s but stopped practicing after I got married. Fifteen years later I started praying and attending Mass again and now my husband (a cradle Catholic) wants to join me at Mass. He was kind of annoyed when I started going and it felt a little bit like he was being possessive and/or insecure. But now he wants to come with me, so I should be happy, right?

Except I’m not. It certainly feels wrong not to want to have him come with me and I prayed for the ability to keep an open mind. He doesn’t really internalize a lot of the faith, though, and I feel equally conflicted about having him there as not, at least while I am still figuring it out for myself. I think he’s being sincere about wanting to go with me, because he wants to always be with me. And then last night he was all like “I think keeping your Catholic husband from attending Mass is probably something God wouldn’t like. Probably a mortal sin. I mean, sharing your faith with others is kind of a big thing for the Catholics. You should look into that.” I mean, of course he’s not wrong but he rolls his eyes and dismisses my offer to include him on the registration each week.

That’s kind of his new line too. I made the mistake of telling him I was trying to stop “the solitary sin” and he has never shown so much interest in trying to touch my body and arouse me at inappropriate moments and then tells me I’m “disappointing God” for denying him. Again, I feel like I should be happy for the increased attention but I’m just so over it.

I know he’s probably just feeling insecure and we’ll get it sorted out eventually. Anyone else been in a similar situation?",Catholicism

I am not a Christian, this is why I am curious about that. Why were they repeating those prayers a part of the afternoon? Is it in order to get a pardon from G.d?

So this happened at Mass a few days ago....,ChemicalCatholic,1621856727,"Hi all,

I serve Holy Mass a few times a week for an elderly priest who has to sit down on a high chair behind the altar for him to be able to say Mass. I highly respect him and the way how he still lives out his vocation despite being physically impaired due to high age.

Anyway last Friday I was serving his Mass and it was time for the offertory. While father poured in the chalice I noticed that it was not wine, but water which he poured in. These specific cruets are made of a dark material, which makes the contents not stand out. The wine cruet is marked with a small piece of rope tied to the handle. It struck me that someone swapped the contents of the cruets! My mind began to panic and I quietly told father that the content of the chalice was not valid matter. He brushed it off because he did not hear me properly (old age). When I came back for the lavabo he asked me: It was wine right? So I told him no it was water! He then promptly asked me to empty the chalice in the sacristy. I made sure to smell the contents of the cruets before handing them to father this time to be sure which were the contents and Mass proceeded without any problems. I was shaking for the rest of Mass haha!

Anyway I felt the need to share this story with me and I am actually thankful to our Lord that He gave me the courage to intervene and make sure Mass was said valid. If you ever encounter a situation similar to this, please say something and do something!

God bless! :)",Catholicism

"James 4:7Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 8Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you",TypicalHaikuResponse,1621854283,"The scripture tells us to submit to God. This isn't something that's just a one off verse in James. God tells us through Himself and Prophets that submission is what He requires from us. 

Romans 12:1
&gt;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.

You are to be a living sacrifice. Not through tithes or idols or weekly church service. Your life is to be dedicated to God.

Hebrews 13
&gt;15 Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise, the fruit of lips that confess His name. 16And do not neglect to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.

You are to continually praise God verbally and do good.  Being Christian is an active and continual service in the name of our Lord. 

John 14:21

&gt;He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.”

When we do the will of God He will not only love us but then manifest himself to us. For anyone who feels He lacks the presence of God this is the time to repent and partake in His instructions.

 2 John 1
&gt;5And now I urge you, dear lady—not as a new commandment to you, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another. 6And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the very commandment you have heard from the beginning, that you must walk in love.

Walk in love and your spiritual life will begin to bear fruit. For Jesus says:

John 15 
&gt;“I am the true vine, and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard. 2He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful. 3You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. 4Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me.
5I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing. 6If anyone does not remain in Me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned. 7If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 8This is to My Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be My disciples.


These are the fruits that should be brought about in our lives so that we know we are doing the will of God.

Galatians 5
&gt;22But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23gentleness, and self-control. 

All of these things are easier said than done but lastly I leave you with what Jesus says for He speaks far more eloquently than I ever could put it.

Matthew 16
&gt;24Then Jesus told His disciples, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. 25For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. 26What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? 27For the Son of Man will come in His Father’s glory with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to what he has done.",Catholicism

I took catechism classes when I was 15 but there was some feud between my parents and the family that gave me rides so I never finished attending all of the classes.

Jerome’s linguistic limitations,coinageFission,1621844852,"As skilled as he is with Hebrew, it seems a little known fact that St Jerome was not all the best when it came to the other scriptural languages. The thought came to me while I was musing over the passages describing the sieges of Jerusalem by Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar, as it turns out some of the names Jerome left untranslated as proper names turned out to be apparently Assyrian and Babylonian titles of office (though given how extinct speakers of the cuneiform-written tongues would have become by his day, his lack of knowledge in that regard is excusable).

This is most egregiously seen in Jeremiah 39:13, part of which runs “...Nabuzardan princeps militiae et Nabusezban et Rabsares et Neregel et Sereser et Rebmag...”. There are no *ands* before *Shar’etzer*, *Rabsaris*, and *Rabmag* in the relevant section of the Hebrew text, which means Jerome or a succeeding copyist inadvertently rendered two Babylonian titles as additional personal names as well as breaking one name into two. If Jerome is responsible, it is a curious thing, because a little ways back in 39:3 we see “Neregel Sereser Semegarnabu Sarsachim Rabsares Neregel Sereser Rebmag” listed as Babylonian officials who sat at the gate of Jerusalem. A past Hebrew copyist seems to have displaced the *nabu* from one name to the preceding, but even so, here Jerome faithfully renders the lack of *ands* from the Hebrew transcriptions of these Babylonian names and titles.

(For those who like interesting biblical trivia, the names that turn out to be titles of office are *Rabsares*, *Rebmag*, *Semegar*, and from IV Kings 18:17 we have *Tharthan* and *Rabsaces*.)

Jerome also confessed to being better at reading Aramaic than pronouncing it in his Prologue to Daniel, and mentions having an interpreter paraphrase the Aramaic text of Tobit into Hebrew so he could render it in Latin — dynamic equivalence, and a rushed translation of a book he personally had objections to, completed in the span of a day!

It is not hard to see at all the weakness of the church when we even have some priests believing the devil isn't real, that Satan is just a metaphor for evil and doesn't really exist.

Today I stopped to reflect after confession,hpspnmag,1621835007,"I'm trying to be more proactive and more active in my faith. One of the biggest things for me is acknowledging when attending confession is needed.

When I left confession today, I realized that I was really anxious. It's not new, but it is the first time I actually stopped to think about why.

When I went to confession when I was a teenager, I felt relieved! My sins were forgiven, and I would feel better. Looking back on this, I think that I saw confession as a clean start that I needed to build up to, and confession was the last step.

Today, I finally noticed and sat with that anxiety that I was feeling: I want to stay in that position, being full of grace. To do that, I need to carry that feeling to follow through with the convictions I made during confession and while doing my penance. I'm an anxious person already and making that realization is going to serve me in making use of that energy.

This shift in my mentality is likely going to make my faith goals more approachable from now on. I thought I should share in case anyone is feeling something but has not sat down to think about the underlying issue.

Not only that, but this group also cause me great spiritual and emotional harm due to some lengthy personal stuff, that I became so detached from their spirituality and just almost desensitized from the whole Gifts of the Spirit push of charismatics that I almost struggle with this feast altogether because the whole idea of Pentecost reminds me of what they believe so adamantly (they kinda fell into the Second Pentecost camp, which is a false idea because there was only one Pentecost. It was not like God saw a drop or two of the Holy Spirit and decided to add water later on to get it out)

How our nature as chronological beings relates to our faith,Nibrudly,1621821874,"Wanted to see what others thought about the matter, and I apologize in advance if I am in error. (This is something I have been Anyone else think about how the fact we move through time (as opposed to being in the ""eternal now"") is a part of so much of our faith?

For example, the fact that due to the existence of what we call time, the ability to change is inherent in the very design of Creation. At first, one might think of the seasons, how the flora changes, how the fauna have breeding cycles and everything grows. We humans follow this natural growth and change as well, becoming older, wiser, more...more, as it were, with each passing second. Now tie this reality into ideology and morality, where our beliefs and opinions are not beholden to any one moment. How we can not only choose to believe one thing, but then *change our minds*, sometimes within moments of our first thought. The angels, though fully knowledgeable within their nature as eternal beings, do not possess this ability; they make a choice and it sticks for eternity. It's why satan cannot be redeemed; the ability does not exist mechanically as it does within Creation. We however, being unable to see the whole picture, steeped in ignorances of various sorts, have the kindness of being able to adapt and change based on new information we encounter. Now one might argue that God could (and *should*) have allowed us the same full knowledge as provided by eternity, and a better theologian would argue that was one of the great tragedies of The Fall of Adam, for we did indeed have a fuller knowledge that was anchored in our relationship to God. And one might then argue how a loving God could allow such an evil occur, and among other answers, I believe it is tied to our relationship with time. 


When it comes to free will, you have to be able to choose. Within Creation, we have the added ability of not only to choose, but to *change*. We grow physically, mentally, and spiritually, *by design*. The fact that God told Adam and Eve to guard Eden, to go forth and multiply, but that it was never a guarantee that they would, is not a failing on God's part, nor a cruelty, but the result of them being chronological beings. They had to *continually* make the choice to maintain the relationship with God, even before the fall, because that's just how time (in conjunction with free will) works. So within our nature there is a responsibility, an obligation, to choose to change. We choose to eat to not be hungry, we choose to learn to be more knowledgeable, we choose to *do* so that something is *done.* (I grant that some of these choices do not seem as such when the consequences or benefits are so obvious and simple, but mechanically, they are indeed choices). We choose to change our wills, sometimes to ignore change, sometimes to be more in line with the Will of God. 


I say all this in relation to the point, ""Why do we have to be responsible? Why would God put this on us?"" There is a lot of emotion in those questions, and there has to be an appeal to that emotion, to be sure.  However, I feel that there are mechanical reasons for why things are the way they are, that do not need to be swept under the rug of ""God has a plan"" or ""everything happens for a reason."" We are built to change, we are built to choose, and we are built to choose to change, and that is at least one reason why everything has to ""be so difficult."" We have to choose to stick to our changes, and to change in ways that are good. Why we have to change as opposed to God is an entirely different post, but long and short of that is God isn't you, and only you can make your choices. Then you figure in how choices and changes have consequences and affects on everything, and the whole thing gets complicated quick.


Anyway, folks have similar thoughts? Critiques? Links to Church doctrine that addresses our chronological nature? I find it an interesting point to think about.",Catholicism

Important Announcement (Final Update),digifork,1621820944,"This is a follow-up to our [update post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/mr64n4/important_announcement_update_3/) concerning comment removals by the Anti-Evil Operations team.

We have completed our discussions with Reddit admins and have come to an understanding. Regarding comments in this subreddit violating site guidelines the admins have said:

&gt; Discussing religious beliefs around LGBT issues is not a violation but dehumanizing or attacking other groups of people is a violation.

This means the admins will take the context into consideration when making removals. They admit that mistakes have been made in the past with their removals and they ask us that if they remove a comment errantly in the future, we report it so they can get better knowing that context. We ask that if anyone gets moderated by the admins, please let us know and we will investigate and escalate to the admins if it was in error.

Having said that, I do want to take a moment here to remind everyone that this subreddit is about charitable and respectful discussion of things concerning the Catholic faith. The general rule of thumb is that if you would not say it in front of your pastor to someone else, then think of a better way to word it. So please consider your tone when using caustic language when speaking of the sinful dispositions of others. We are to respect and love people, even people who disagree with us and even people who we may consider to be enemies. We generally don't have a problem with this, but all it takes is a few bad apples to spoil the bunch.

We want to lead people to the truth, and we want this subreddit to be a place people can feel welcome to ask their questions about the faith even if they are unpopular or divisive. We need to address everyone with kindness and clarity without compromising the faith. If we do that, we will be discussing religious beliefs and not dehumanizing or attacking others.

&gt; A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.

How was the Frankish Papacy (800 AD) theologically justifiable?,chuuka-densetsu,1621813402,"I read an interesting article from an Eastern Orthodox Christian writer and am curious for your thoughts: http://www.orthodoxchristianbooks.com/articles/639/charlemagne-western-schism/

Why did the Roman Pontiff rebel from the Roman Empire? I don't think it is true that the Pope had the authority to re-create the Roman Empire in the West. It seems to be a result of human political pride and self-preservation getting in the way of purity and truth.

When the Turks invaded Constantinople, the Eastern Orthodox submitted humbly to the defeat and accepted their fate, and as a result their doctrine has stayed very consistent.

When the Lombards invaded Rome, the Roman Pontiff seemed to pursue his own selfish political interest and use opportunism to get what he wanted. It is also true that Frankish Catholicism religion seems to take a very different attitude and color than Roman Latin Catholicism.

God promised He would protect the church, so why did the Pope try to take matters into his own hands? Doesn't that seem to show a lack of faith?

I am really not in a good place mentally. I need Someone to talk to about this.,Mike-loves-outdoors,1621806764,"Hey. So I posted about my fear a couple times on here, but I decided to post again since there are new things happening with it. 

So I have this phobia of gates. Like the ones you walk through. It started with a nightmare. Which then developed into a full-on phobia of gates. Basically, long story very short, I believe gates are alive and they want to kill me. So ya, I can't go near them. I am seeing a therapist but I just want to talk to other people as well. So since my fear started, I have found out more and more places have gates. I can't go to those places anymore. Fairs, festivals, friends houses. They are not safe anymore because of the gates. 

Well about a month ago, My friend and I were talking about my fear. He told me, ""Just so you know, there are gates to Heaven."" I thought  he was joking. I was like Ya right. Then I looked it up. And there are. 12 of them it said. I will admit, I cried. Now Heaven was ruined. I also saw that Hell has 7 gates, and I was like, You Know, that makes sense. Since in my mind, Hell is full of the things you fear. 

So now, the fear is getting worse with time. Now, I am terrified of Heaven because of this. It's really bad. I hate that I feel this way, but now, I don't want to go to Heaven anymore. My heart hurts because of this. I am so scared of it. Heaven is the last place you should be scared of, yet here I am. Not wanting to go. 

By the way, Happy Pentacost! Last week was the Ascension. When Jesus goes to Heaven. So that really didn't help my fear. Last week, The Sunday was the day that was the hardest. It was so hard. During Mass, Father was talking about the Gospel. He always asks us questions to reflect on. He first asked if we are excited to go home every day. Then he asked, are we excited to go home to Heaven. Go home to God. I bet everyone in the Church said yes. Everyone except me. I tried  not to cry during the rest of Mass. It was so hard to get through. 

So  that  is where I am now. I don't want to go to Heaven anymore. I don't want to go to Hell either. So I don't know. Hopefully someone can convince me to want to go to Heaven. Because my heart  is broken. 

Please, I just need someone to talk to. I'm sorry for the rant, I just needed to get this out. It felt good to write this down, but I still don't want to go. 

Thank you guys for reading this. DM me so we can talk. Have a good day for me. I know someone will have a good day, I just wish that someone was me as well.",Catholicism

Catholicism is really starting to feel like a cult to me,Vivid_Blueberry7,1621805395,"Okay so I grew up going to a Catholic school and just this year switched to public school (of my own choice, but also partially because we moved towns). So basically the entirety of my life that I can remember, I've been surrounded by Catholicism. I feel like I should mention, however, that I am Christian. A few years ago I chose to not be confirmed in the Catholic church because I just did not feel at home there. 

Every time our Priest came into class to talk with us and every time we went to Church as a school, It felt so foreign and weird. I felt like I was surrounded by ""crazy people"" (the words of 8 year old me's diary). Some things just didn't add up. Like confession...I know it's a very sacred thing for Catholics and I respect that, but it just doesn't make sense to me. I thought when Jesus died on the cross, the veil in the temple was torn, which meant we didn't have to keep relying on church elders?  Or did I misunderstand that?

Also, I felt like the church was just riddled with white supremacy and xenophobia. I've only come to know the words for it in the past few years, but have noticed it since forever. Everyone just seemed so intolerant toward people who weren't \*exactly\* like them. And not only did they not like others, they would go out of their way to make their lives miserable. That does not seem Christ like at all. I mean, how can you really call other religions ""primitive"" and ""barbaric"" and ""evil"" when your favourite part of the week is when you consume the blood and flesh of a demigod in a room full of chanting elders? Everyone seemed hypocritical.

Something else that bothered me was how insincere everything felt. When I get home from school I spend the better part of my evening praying to God, with my own words. I have conversations with him, and I love it. But all of my friends, teachers, etc. who were catholic only prayed at church. Before you say that I could be wrong, I asked. Multiple times. The only times they prayed were after confession, during mass, or when we did it as a school. Some prayed before they ate, too. But even when they did pray, the were only reciting lines of the Our Father or Hail Mary that they had had memorised since they were 5. You could tell they were thinking about other things as they mindlessly spewed out the words. Now, let me be clear, I have nothing against these prayers, but when it's the only thing you say, what's even the point? 

Look, I'm really not trying to come across as rude or offensive, although I'm sure I inadvertently have, for which I apologise. I just don't understand these things. Was this just my local community that was messed up, or is Catholicism really just like that?",Catholicism

Pentecost Reflection,Common_Judge8434,1621799515," 

Romans 8:

8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. 9 But you are not in the flesh; on the contrary, you are in the spirit, if only the Spirit of God dwells in you. Whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. 10 But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is alive because of righteousness. 11 If the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also, through his Spirit that dwells in you. 12 Consequently, brothers and sisters, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 13 For if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 14 For those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. 15 For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you received a Spirit of adoption, through whom we cry, “Abba, Father!” 16 The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ, if only we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.

Having the gift of God the Holy Spirit is freedom from our previous way of life. It's easy for us to forget that, which is why Paul emphasizes we have to put to death the desires of the flesh. It's a painful process, but glory awaits us if we walk in the Spirit. It's only through Him, that we can be holy as He is holy.",Catholicism

Some questions on the differences between Evangelical Christianity and Catholicism,iTAMEi,1621792058,"Hi there r/catholicism,

First some context on me, catholic background growing up (UK) but today largely an atheist/agnostic. Not totally closed to religion, I just have just grown to take it metaphorically rather than literally. I think the values taught are a good framework for life but I don’t believe in an afterlife etc. 

Anyway I have a friend at work who is an Evangelical Calvinist and I am curious about the differences to Catholicism. I’ve met some of his friends and they hold some extreme beliefs about gay people and single mothers. I watched some clips of their services and it seems really heavy on the sinner talk and Jesus saving you. 

Obviously Catholicism is based around this too but from my childhood memories of church it was a bit more chilled out and we would spend more time talking about nice things Jesus did and how to be like him. I think this is much better. Don’t remember any discussions about gay people either. 

Anyway is my comparison correct?",Catholicism

Scrupulosity,StaindGlassLover,1621782096,"I’ve seen a lot of posts about people worried about their state of grace, whether their confession is adequate or not, or even if they’re worthy of absolution. 

A great many of you are very young and it’s wonderful you’re concerned about your path to holiness. However, there was a period of almost 23 years where I didn’t go to confession. During that time I was vain and I used people to my own liking. In retrospect, it was villainous. Even before that confession in 1996, I wasn’t obedient to Our Father.

I suffered for my sins. This is to say that God’s permissive will allowed me to be chastised for my walking, no taking a long hike, off His path. For this, I blamed Him. Cursed Him. Screamed at Him. I was literally alone in the middle of a Texan desert giving Him ultimatums on my return to Him. I was and continue to be a great fool. 

So, being one who has been there and one who constantly rides the crest of this wave of scruples, I know where you are.

How is an ordinary person supposed to determine the correct answer to disputes which even the experts cannot agree on? Why are questions of utmost spiritual importance so irresolvable?,Low-Elk-8809,1621753317,"A typical answer will be that this is the role the Magisterium exists to play, but the problem is verifying that Magisterium's authority in the first place. There don't seem to be any obvious (or broadly agreed upon) epistemic criteria by which an ordinary person can discern whether the Catholic Church has a better claim to spiritual authority than any other religious institution. It seems that, unless a person resorts to gut feeling and intuition (which hardly seems reliable, since people's guts point them in different directions all the time), they must involve themselves in obscure and lengthy scholarly discourses, and even then there's no certainty about the conclusion they might come to.

Now we might say that an ordinary person doesn't have to do all this work themselves and can rely on the testimony of experts who have done the work, but we are faced with the same problem: that of verifying which experts have the best expertise, since experts are all at odds with one another, and all use their social credit to lend authority to many different competing truth claims. Because of their identical nature (when it comes to religion, there is no single accepted standard of accreditation), we cannot trust any claims of these prima facie. And even knowing that someone is an expert is not enough to warrant total credulity: most Catholics would presumably recognise that William Lane Craig and Bart Ehrman are serious scholars, and yet disagree with them... not so much on the basis of having worked out independently why they are wrong, but because their conclusions are incompatible with the Catholic's pre-existing worldview (and usually they will appeal to the arguments of their own experts, who, again, they agree with not because they have been able to independently and impartially verify that Catholic experts are better than Evangelical experts, but because they accord with their own worldview). None of this behaviour is unique to Catholics: the actual problem is that it is not.

There don't seem to be any broadly agreed upon criteria for determining religious truth. In his 1907 encyclical, *Pascendi Dominici gregis****,*** Pope St. Pius X said of the historical-critical study of the Bible:

&gt;Anybody who embraces and employs it, makes profession thereby of the errors contained in it, and places himself in opposition to the Catholic Faith.

There are more moderate opinions on historical-critical method. This is what Pope Benedict XVI had to say (in *The Light of the World*, 2010):

&gt;What is needed is not simply a break with the historical method, but a self-critique of the historical method; a self-critique of historical reason that takes cognizance of its limits and recognizes the compatibility of a type of knowledge that derives from faith; in short, we need a synthesis between an exegesis that operates with historical reason and an exegesis that is guided by faith. We have to  bring the two things into a proper relationship to each other. That is also a requirement of the basic relationship between faith and reason. 

So the historical-critical method must be guided by faith in order to iron out its flaws: but this is obviously not something accessible to a non-Catholic, or someone who wants to approach it from a neutral perspective, for it presupposes the validity of faith (which is exactly the thing being questioned... can one only properly verify the Quran's veracity if guided by the light of Muslim faith?). Which means that a prospective believer who studies Biblical scholarship and criticism in order to discern the truth will not be engaged in a neutral activity but in an anti-Catholic one; while if they rely on Church Tradition, they also will obviously not be giving alternative traditions much of a fair trial. It seems like you have to submit to one exclusive epistemological school if you are to come to any kind of conclusion at all. There is no ""neutral"" third party in the debate to whom we can appeal (as the ancient sceptics used to say). You are always anchored in something (whether it is a faith in the primacy of the scientific method, or faith in the primacy of the hadiths or the magisterium) that predisposes you to some conclusions and cripples your ability to come to others, which operate under different metrics. And the problem goes on indefinitely: ""how can we verify that this method is the best, without a method for verifying the best method?"" and so on and so on, ad infinitum. And everyone has different ideas about what that method is.

Even if we ""go back to basics"" and scrutinise the founders of the religions themselves, we come up against the same problem: the rhetoric of Christ and the Buddha -- about why they, and not other teachers, ought to be believed -- seem essentially identical to me. Neither are convincing unless I'm actually able to witness their miracles, which I can't. And looking at modern miracles doesn't help much either, given that these miracles aren't exclusive to Catholicism. As one poster here pointed out, if you don't suppose a materialist worldview, there's no reason why these miracles can't really be supernatural -- the work of demons. (But then why can we attribute miraculous activity to antichrists and false prophets but the Sanhedrin were wrong to attribute these to Christ? Other religions perform exorcisms. What if Hindu miracles are divine and Catholic ones are demonic? etc. etc.).

Of course, none of these epistemological quandaries are unique to Catholicism (the problem of the authoritativeness of the expert is extremely relevant to modern society in general), but because of Catholicism's (and other religions') emphasis on the fact that **people are eternally damned or saved on the basis of what they believe,** it makes determining the true religion accurately **unfathomably more urgent than any other human activity**. So it seems odd that it is so murky. Left up so much to mere chance. Something that people can, apparently with equally good reason, hold wildly differing views on.",Catholicism
I am saddened by what they do to children,codecoded_,1621750783,"Hello all, 

I’m 16 and tonight I was playing Xbox, and I ended up playing with a kid who said he was 10. He later started talking about how he was “non-binary” and “bisexual”.  Hearing this felt horrible.

A child of the age of 10 was saying things like this.

I told him stuff like the biology and how he’s actually a boy and being this young and saying all of this can be really harmful in the future, but other than that, I didn’t know what to say.

The Suffering Servant Songs of Isaiah,EthanCBohr,1621742117,"For a long time in my life I was an agnostic. Only in the past 2 years have a sympathized with Christianity, and a few months ago I finally committed. The day I seriously considered Christianity is when I read the Bible through on a lark and came to the Suffering Servant Songs of Isaiah. These texts really spoke to me (knowing the basic contours of Jesus' life), and ever since than it's been a journey for sure. Here I will examine these Songs that inspired me, especially Isaiah 52:13-53:12 (as that's all I have room to realty cover extensively), and show the applicability of these passages to Jesus.

The Servant Songs (42:1–9; 49:1–6; 50:4–11; 52:13–53:12) are unique to Isaiah 40-55 and are four distinct poetic sections or units that function homogeneously within chapters 40–55. While identified with Israel (41:8–9) initially, the Servant is gradually revealed in Isaiah 40-55, mostly within the Servant Songs, as an individual who acts on behalf of Israel. Within these Servant songs, the Servant of YHWH is described as bringing forth new teachings (Isaiah 42:4, 6), such that he is a ""teacher"" (Isaiah 50:4), being a covenant to the peoples (Isaiah 42:6), preaching to Israel (Isaiah 49:5-6), and revealing YHWH to ""the nations"" (Isaiah 42:6; 49:1, 6; 52:15), some of which have difficulty hearing the report (Isaiah 53:1). It has been suggested that the Servant’s “sprinkling” of the nations (Isaiah 52:15) implies the redemptive significance of his work in their behalf (cf. Ware 2005, pp. 86, n. 110). The messiah in the Servant songs also grows up in a poor or non-royal background (Isaiah 53:2), he is physically abused (Isaiah 50:6; 53:3, 5), rejected by Israel (Isaiah 53:3-9), dies and is buried (Isaiah 53:7-9), bears the sins of the many (Isaiah 53:10-12), such that he is a ""guilt offering"" (Isaiah 53:10), is exalted (Isaiah 52:13), righteous (Isaiah 53:10), is equated with YHWH (Isaiah 52:13), and is resurrected (Isaiah 53:10-11). This is Jesus, and evidence of divine inspiration.

**Introduction to Isaiah 52:13-53:12**

The text starts off by saying that the Servant will be exalted by God. But, the Servant's appearance is so marred (or a ""supernatural anointing,"" as Peter Gentry translates it). If the former translation is accurate, this is just meant to antitheisize the Servant from the typical expectation of what a king was supposed to be (52:14). According to Psalm 45:3, a king must be ""fairer than the sons of men,"" but the Servant was the opposite of the appearance of a king like figure of the ANE. Moving on, many Jewish interpreters take the kings and nations in Isaiah 52:15 as the speaker for Isaiah 53:1-9. However, ""the speaker can't be the nations and kings of 52:15, because \[the text\] tells us that they had not heard a message, nor therefore had they delivered one (cf. Goldingay, *Isaiah*, kindle loc. 5876). Furthermore, as J.L. Koole points out, ""it is strange that the nations who, without previously hearing of the Servant, now pay tribute to him, would talk about 'our' unbelief. These arguments . . . confirm other exegetes in their opinion that Israel is now speaking in a confession of her failure to recognize the Servant"" (Jan L. Koole, *Isaiah 49-55,* Peeters, 1998, pp. 276). This is an amazing prophecy in light of the context this oracle was written in. Judaism was a small culture that was very small on the world stage. For the prophet to know that a person would come out of Israel to spread the greatness of YHWH across the world when the Israelites could have easily ended up like most cultures, namely, wiped out, is either a really good guess or is indicative of divine foreknowledge. But how are the nations related to the activity of the Servant in the fourth Song? James P. Ware writes:

&gt;In the opening divine oracle, many nations and kings through the Servant come to see and comprehend (52:15). Several factors indicate that the “many nations” spoken of here are understood as brought to the worship of Yahweh through the Servant. Tradition-historically, the depiction of “nations” and “kings” beholding the glory of Yahweh belongs to the eschatological pilgrimage tradition (Isa 60:3, 10, 11, 16; Ps 47:8-9; 102:15-16; 102:22; 138:4-5; cf. Ps 22:27-28; 66:1-4). Moreover, from a literary standpoint the phrase “many nations” (גּוׂיִם רַבִּים), within the final composition of the book of Isaiah, recalls the first two Servant passages (42:6, 49:6), as well as the eschatological pilgrimage oracle in Isaiah 2:2-5. In all of these passages the gentiles are the recipients of salvation, and in Isaiah 42:6 and 49:6 the means of their conversion is specifically the work of the Servant. Finally, careful repetition of key terms closely connects the opening and closing stanzas to one another, and suggests that the “many” (רַבִּים) who receive redemption through the Servant in the closing divine oracle in 53:10-12 recall and include the “many nations” (גּוׁיִם רַבִּים) of 52:13-15.

(James P. Ware, *Paul and the Mission of the Church, Philippians in Ancient Jewish Context*, pp. 76-77)

After the rejection of the Servant (Isaiah 53:3-6), the servant dies an unjust death (53:7-9). The Servant’s rejection and death than result in a righteous offspring (Isaiah 53:10) who carry out the faithful activity of the Servant in suffering and anticipation of the new creation (cf. Isaiah 57:1). The reference to the offspring is just meant to denote the children of Zion (cf. Jan L Koole, *Isaiah 49-55,* pp. 324). In other words, the ""offspring"" do not refer to literal children. The offspring promised to the Servant is the faithful remnant redeemed by him. After Isaiah 53, they are identified as “the servants of YHWH” (cf. Isaiah 54:17 and after), in the plural (56:6; 63:17; 65:8, 9, 13, 14, 15; 66:14).

The Servant than sees his offspring and sees light after his demise. For the servant to see his offspring (the Servant's Servants) and for his days to be prolonged, and for him to see light means that the Servant of YHWH was raised to life in Isaiah's thinking (see Jan L. Koole \[1998\] and Gary V. Smith \[2009\]). In fact, James P. Ware writes:

&gt;Given the generally undeveloped character of concepts of resurrection in ancient Judaism prior to the post-exilic period, a number of interpreters have questioned whether the text can actually speak of the Servant’s return to life. *However, that the Servant is portrayed in the fourth Song as restored from death to life is recognized by the majority of interpreters* **\[1\]**. The text is explicit that following his demise the Servant “will prolong days” (53:10) and “will see light” (53:11).

(James P. Ware, *Paul and the Mission of the Church, Philippians in Ancient Jewish Context*, pp. 86, n. 108)

Isaiah also calls the Servant the ""righteous one,"" and says that he will be a guilt offering, and bear the sins of ""many."" According to Joseph Blenkinsopp, the term ‘*asham*’ in Isa. 53:10 refers to the sacrificial ritual of the guilt offering. Blenkinsopp thinks this reference is supported by indications throughout Isaiah 53, and that 'therefore the suffering and death of this Servant of the LORD is to be understood as sacrificial by analogy with the ritual of the guilt or reparation offering in the book of Leviticus' (cf. Joseph Blenkinsopp, ""The Sacrificial Life and Death of the Servant (Isaiah 52:13-53:12),"" *Vetus Testamentum 66,* 2016, [pp. 1](https://jstor.org/stable/43894343?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)).

# Is Israel the Servant of YHWH?

Some scholars and many Jewish people point to the context, where the Servant is explicitly called Israel around ten times prior to Isaiah 53 (e.g., Isaiah 41:8-9; 43:10; 44:1-2, 21; 45:4; 48:20). However, there are many indicators that prove that the Servant is not Israel as a collective. It should be emphasized that the extension of the servant’s role, especially in chapter 49, is not an attempt to replace an earlier corporate understanding of the servant Israel with that of an individual prophetic or messianic figure. Rather, the servant always remains Israel, but Israel is now understood within the dynamic movement of the prophetic history as embodied in a suffering, individual messianic figure who has been divinely commissioned to the selfsame task of the deliverance of the chosen people and the nations at large. Here are reasons why the Servant cannot be Israel as a nation or people (a collective):

1. **Relationship with Israel (cf. Isaiah 49:5-6)**: ""Is this Servant not same Israel who can bear testimony who can bear this honorary name in 41:8f., 42:19 and so many time more? Is it not precisely this tormented, tortured people that deserves the name 'man of sorrows'?... Indeed, it is true that the Servant of the Lord does not want to be isolated from the Servant Israel. On the contrary. In 49:5f. he has a very special relationship with this people, as chap. 53 also shows. But precisely this relationship excludes the identification"" (Jan L Koole, *Isaiah 49-55,* Peeters, 1998, pp. 250-251). Isaiah 49:5-6 distinguishes the Servant from Israel plainly. See below for more on this point.
2. **The Righteous Servant**: The description of the Servant as being untainted with violence or deceit is impossible to reconcile with OT's description of Israel as a nation or a people (the fourth song even labels the Servant the ""righteous one""). In 43:22-28, Israel fails to call on the Lord; in 47:6, God is angry with Israel; in 48:1-6, Israel is guilty again, with the exile and return foretold (see also 48:8b-11, 17-19); and in 50:1, God’s indictment is forthright: “for your iniquities you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away"" (synonymous with exile). As noted by Hugenberger, “Deutero-Isaiah repeatedly stresses that contemporary Israel is a sinful people who suffer on account of their own transgressions (42:18- 25; 43:22-28; 47:7; 48:18f.; 50:1; 54:7; 57:17; 59:2ff.)"" (Hugenberger, “The Servant of the Lord in the ‘Servant Songs’ of Isaiah: A Second Moses Figure,” pp. 108). This is in harmony with other literature in the OT: Amos (e.g., 4:4-12); Hosea (5:7-15); Jeremiah (32:28-36); Ezekiel (5:5- 17); Lamentations; Ezra (9:6-7); Nehemiah (9:26-36); and Zechariah (1:1-6). Thus, within the context of Second Isaiah, it is clear that the Servant cannot be Israel.
3. **""My People"":** The words, “He was cut off . . . for the transgression of my people” (53:8), distinguish the Servant from “my people,” who refers to the people of Israel. An identification of the Servant with Israel is excluded because the ‘he’ who was ‘cut off’ cannot have the same referent as ‘my people.’  In the context of Second/Third Isaiah (Isaiah 40-66), ""my people"" always refers to Israel or it's people. As Hugenberger writes: ""this conclusion holds whether or not one chooses to emend the MT, ‘my people' to read ‘his people' with 1QIsa^(a)"" (Hugenberger, “The Servant of the Lord in the ‘Servant Songs’ of Isaiah: A Second Moses Figure,” pp. 6).
4. **Mišpāṭ:** For all the evidence that the passages' arrangement invites us to infer that Jacob-Israel is the Servant, their content also hints that Jacob Israel cannot fulfil this role. As John Goldingay notes: ""the servant's task concerns the establishing of mišpāṭ; Jacob-Israel has mišpāṭ problems of its own (40.27). The Servant will not cry out in lament or protest; Jacob-Israel is doing so"" (John Goldingay, *Isaiah 40-55*, pp. 153). Compare Isaiah 49:4: ""but I said, “I \[the servant\] have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; *yet* *surely* ***my cause*** **(*****mispati*****)** *is* ***with*** *the* *Lord*, and my reward with my God.” to Isaiah 40:27: Why do you say, *O Jacob, and speak, O Israel*,“ My way is hidden from the Lord, *and* ***my right*** **(*****mispati*****)** *is* ***disregarded*** *by my God*”? In Isaiah 49:4, where the Servant affirms that, despite the setbacks he has faced, “my cause (*mispati*) is with the Lord’. This looks like a deliberate contrast with Jacob/Israel, who had earlier complained that my right (*mispati*) is disregarded by God’ (40:27).
5. **The Speaker:** ""The final objection to an identification of the Servant in the songs with corporate Israel is the observation that throughout Isaiah whenever the pronouns ‘we,’ ‘our,’ or ‘us’ are introduced abruptly, as in 53:1ff. (that is, without an explicit identification of the speakers, as in 2:3; 3:6; 4:1; etc.), it is always the prophet speaking on behalf of the people of Israel with whom he identifies (1:9f.; 16:6; 24:26; 33:2, 20; 42:24; 59:9-12; 63:15-19; 64:3-11; etc.). Accordingly, if the ‘we’ or ‘us’ in 53:1ff. is the prophet speaking on behalf of Israel, then the ‘he’ or ‘him’ of these same verses cannot also be a reference to Israel. Consistent with this observation, other considerations support an interpretation of the ‘we’ in 53:6 as a reference to Israel, with whom the prophet identifies: ‘All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way, and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.’ There are well known parallels for the comparison between Israel and sheep who have gone astray: Psalm 95:7-10; 119:176; Jeremiah 50:6. At several points within Isaiah the prophet acknowledges both his own sinfulness and the universality of sin among the people of Israel (cf. 6:5; 59:11-13; 64:5-9). Accordingly, if the ‘we’ of 53:6 is Israel with whom the prophet identifies (hence the emphatic comprehensiveness of the first person plural references: ‘all we’ and ‘us all’, the ‘him’ cannot at the same time be a reference to Israel.  ..."" (Hugenberger, “The Servant of the Lord in the ‘Servant Songs’ of Isaiah: A Second Moses Figure,” pp. 6-7).

# Is a Righteous Remnant of Israel the Servant of YHWH?

Some scholars think that the Servant refers to a righteous remnant of Israel. This interpretation, however, breaks down since:

1. The Servant is clearly an individual elsewhere in Isa 40–55, and since Isa 53 reads most naturally as personal rather than collective, there is no good reason to apply it to the righteous remnant, unless that remnant is reduced to one, the Savior of the world. That the Servant is an individual is clear. He will be a human being, conceived in and born from a mother’s womb (49:1bc), for example. In fact, while he doesn't think the Servant is the messiah, Joseph Blenkinsopp writes: ""since Christopher R. North surveyed the range of opinion on the identity of the Servant in 1948 (2d ed., 1956), no significant new options have emerged. ***While there was then and still is a strong critical preference for an individual rather than a collective interpretatio*****n**, none of the fifteen individuals named as candidates by one commentator or another and listed by North has survived scrutiny"" (Joseph Blenkinsopp, *Isaiah 40-55*, Yale University Press, 2002, pp. 355).
2. Whenever Isaiah uses the word ""servant"" in a collective sense, it is always with the addition of “Jacob” or “Israel” (Isa 41:8; 44:1, 2, 21; 45:4; 48:20) or through use of plurals alongside the singular (e.g., 43:10-14; 48:20, 21) to indicate the collective use. This is all absent in the Servant songs.
3. The point of the remnant being sinful is made specifically clear in 46:3-12; 48:1, 8; 53:6, 8; 55:7; 58:1ff.; 63:17; 64:5-7. So the same point about Israel's lack of righteousness applies here as well.
4. The suffering of the righteous remnant did not bring healing to the nations, as the Servant songs say the Servant would. The return from exile is a judgement on the nations for their excessive treatment of Israel (cf. Jer. 50:17-18; Mic. 5:5-6), The nations were not healed, and the righteous remnant caused judgment (rather than healing) to come upon their enemies (cf. Lam 1:22 and 3:61-66). So Isaiah probably didn't intend a righteous remnant of Israel to be the Servant.
5. Once again, Kool's point is relevant here. In Isaiah 53:7, the Servant is silent According to Jan L. Koole, ""the interpretation of the servant as Israel (or her best part) is hard put to explain this silence, cf. e.g., the complaints of the people in Ps. 74:1, 11 (""Why...?""), 79:5 (""How long...?""), and Israel's prayer for vengeance in Ps. 79:12; 137:4ff"" (Jan L Koole, *Isaiah 49-55,* pp. 301).

# The Servant as Messianic

Here are positive reasons to take the Servant as messianic:

**(1) Isaiah 42:1-9**: Isaiah has many royal features to it that compare to the messianic prophecy of Isaiah 11. For example, the messianic king of Isaiah 11, just like the Servant of Isaiah 42, is blessed by the Spirit of God (Isaiah 11:2; cf. 42:1) to establish justice (Isaiah 11:3-5; cf. 42:3-4). But if Isaiah 42 is messianic, so to are the rest of the Servant songs (the same is true for Isaiah 49 and 50). The idea of ""springing up"" (*tiṣmaḥnāh*) in Isaiah 42:9 also points to the messianic identity of the servant in Isaiah 42, an thus for the rest of the servant songs. It is probably not accidental that the noun form derived from this root (*ṣmḥ*) refers to the ""Branch"" of the Lord (4:2; Jer 23:5; 33:15; Zech 3:8), a term employed for the Davidic Messiah in the OT. Even the Aramaic Targum and portions of 1 Enoch interpreted the Servant Song in Isaiah 42 as messianic, which is early evidence indeed.

&amp;#x200B;

**(2) Kingly Traits:** Kingly traits in the figure of the servant are apparent. The Servant is to free the prisoners from dungeon (42:7, 49:9), to lead back the tribes of Jacob (49:6), and to reapportion the waste lands of Palestine (49:8). He is effectively the Israelite king, though the expression is avoided. Another feature that hints at a Davidic messiah is the reference to a rich burial, which is typically suitable for a royal person. The Servant is even placed over, against, and raised above other political leaders (see Isaiah 49:7; 52:13; 53:12. The Servant is therefore the ideal king - the messiah. See Daniel I. Block ""My Servant David,"" in  *Israel's Messiah in the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls,* pp. 50 (n. 145). If Block is right, than the reference to the Servant's ""supernatural anointing"" (52:14) would also be a powerful hint towards the Servant being a Davidic messiah.

&amp;#x200B;

**(3) Isaiah 53:2:** Isaiah 53:2 hints that the passage is messianic. Compare Isaiah 53:2:

&gt;""For he grew up before him like a ***young shoot***, and *like a* ***root*** ***(šōreš)*** *out of dry ground.""*

to Isaiah 11:1, 10:

&gt;""***A shoot*** shall come out from the stump of Jesse...,"" and 11:10: ""On that day *the* ***root (šōreš)*** *of Jesse* shall stand as a signal to the peoples; the nations shall inquire of him...""

Isaiah 53:2 parallels Isaiah 11:1, 10. Klaus Baltzer writes: ""Shoot/branch” (יוֹנֵק) and “root” (שֹׁרֶשׁ) associate this passage with the “messianic” prophecy in Isa 11:1–9, 10"" (Klaus Baltzer, *Deutero-Isaiah*, Hermeneia, 2001, pp. 404).

&amp;#x200B;

**(4) Earliest Interpretation:** The earliest, or at least one of the earliest interpretations of Isaiah 52:13-53:12 is the Book of Daniel, and it is messianic. It is highly significant that there are many remarkable lexical and thematic links in Dan 9:24-27 that enable us the Messiah in Dan 9 to the suffering Servant in Isaiah 52:13-53:12: (1) three major sin terms; (2) *Niphal* (""cut off""); (3) (""no help for him""); (4) the allusion from Dan. 12:3 (‘those who justify the many’) to Isa. 53:11 (‘he shall justify the many’). Daniel 11-12 also seems dependent on Isaiah 52:13-53:12. Zechariah also seems to have interpreted the Servant Songs as messianic. A case can be made out for the messianic passages in Zechariah 12 and 13 making allusion to Isaiah (e.g., the piercing and rejection of the messiah by Israel in 12:10, and the sheep which go astray in Isa. 53:6 to the scattered flock of Zech. 13:7). See Daniel I. Block ""My Servant David,"" in  *Israel's Messiah in the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls,* pp. 51 for more on this link between Zechariah and Isaiah 53. This is very probative evidence indeed.

&amp;#x200B;

**(5) The Servant as a Deity:** Compare Isaiah 52:13:

&gt;Behold, my servant shall act wisely; *he shall be* ***high and lifted up***, and shall be exalted. (ESV)

to Isaiah 6:1:

&gt;In the year that King Uzziah died *I saw the Lord* sitting upon a throne, ***high and lifted up***; and the train of his robe filled the temple. (ESV)

and to Isaiah 57:15:

&gt;For thus says *the One who is* ***high and lifted up***... (ESV)

""Isaiah 52:13 states, with emphasis, the exaltation of the Servant, presumably following the humiliation and death described in the following passage. There are two points to notice about it: (1) The words 'exalted' and 'lifted up' ('my Servant shall be exalted and lifted up') occur also in Isaiah 6:1, introducing Isaiah's vision of God on his throne (where the throne is described as 'exalted and lifted up'), and in Isaiah 57:15, which describes God, dwelling in the heights of heaven, as himself 'exalted and lifted up'. The combination of the two Hebrew roots rum ('to be high; 'to be exalted') and *nasa'* ('to lift up') is rare in the Hebrew Bible, and the verbal coincidence between these three verses is striking. Modern Old Testament scholars think the two later passages, Isaiah 52:13 and 57:15, must be dependent on Isaiah 6:1"" (Bauckham, *Jesus And The God Of Israel,* pp. 50-51). Wilcox and Paton Williams observe, ‘Throughout Isaiah 1–66, the adjectives “exalted”, “lifted up” and “very high” are virtually technical terms, applied almost exclusively to Yahweh' (Peter Wilcox and David Paton-Williams, ‘The Servant Songs in Deutero-Isaiah’, *JSOT* 42 \[1988\], pp. 95). In fact, according to [this article](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/scottish-journal-of-theology/article/abs/who-is-isaiahs-servant-narrative-identity-and-theological-potentiality/AA7056349C36CC87EE69E4AEF07C7A17):

&gt;Isaiah 52:13 LXX chooses the term ‘glorification’ (δoξασθησται ´ ) for the ‘greatly exalted’ ( ) of the MT. Elsewhere in Isaiah the prophetic word has emphasised twice over that YHWH’s glory belongs to none other than himself (Isaiah 42:8; 48:11). ‘I will give my glory to no other’. Yet in Isaiah 52:13, the Servant is narratively depicted as one who is sharing in what belongs to YHWH alone, that is, his glory. (pp. 132)

All of this suggests the Servant is a deity, in line with Isaiah 9:6, which speaks of a Davidic messianic ruler. [Isaiah 9:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+9%3A6-7&amp;version=NRSV) says that a son (the messiah) will be called ""el gibbor"" (Mighty God). In Isaiah 9:6-7, the initial announcement that a child “is born” (*yullad*) is a prophetic perfect verb to bring the reader to look back in time *from the future* (cf. J. Alec Motyer, *The Prophecy of Isaiah*, pp. 97). The prophetic nature of this text is proven by the future tense at the end of Isaiah 9:7, including the reference to the son's birth (""The zeal of the Lord of hosts *will* do this""). The description of the child cannot be applied to a merely human king - a 'God like warrior,"" as opposed to a deity. In fact, wherever the term ‘Mighty God’ (*el gibbor*) is used, *it is used exclusively (aside from one later example) for YHWH in the Hebrew Bible*. This is clear elsewhere, where no doubt the term refers to YHWH (cf. Deut. 10:17; Jer. 32:18). In fact, Isaiah uses the same exact words for the YHWH Himself in 10:20-21 in the very next chapter! Isaiah 10:21 says: ""a remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the *mighty God""* *(el gibbor).* This is very good evidence that ""*el gibbor*"" is not a theophoric name, but is saying that the person in question (the son of Isaiah 9:6) will be called YHWH Himself, going beyond a theophoric name (cf. John Goldingay, *Isaiah*, New International Biblical Commentary \[Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2001\], pp. 73). There is one example from Ezekiel 32:21 where *el gibbor* is not used for YHWH. However, there are three arguments against the relevance of this text:

1. It's from a later text from the 6th century BCE that does not cohere with the earliest usage of the terms.
2. Unlike Isaiah, the term ""el gibbor"" in Ezekiel is plural and overtly linked in a genitive relation.
3. Isaiah's own usage of the phrase in Isaiah 10:21 demonstrates the likelihood of ""el gibbor"" in Isa 9:6 referring to YHWH.

Thus, this oracle is saying that the son will be called YHWH. Unless Isaiah thought that Hezekiah or some other human figure around his time was his God (YHWH), there is little reason to think that Isaiah was speaking of Hezekiah or any other contemporary king or son of a king here. There is no evidence that Isaiah or his disciples that added material to 'First Isaiah' worshipped any deity but YHWH. Rather, Isaiah was speaking of an ideal future messiah being called YHWH in Isaiah 9.

# Did The Gospel Authors Make Jesus Fit This Prophecy?

However, it is extremely probable that the basic narrative behind Jesus' passion is historical, so that, even if every single detail is *not* historical in the Gospels, this is still a prophecy fulfilled. I think the Gospel authors more so cited the OT in light of historical events instead of creating events out of the OT (besides for perhaps the Gospel of Matthew). This can be shown by what scholars consider reliable sources (Paul, Josephus, and Tacitus). Paul, Josephus and Tacitus give enough information to show that the core narrative in the Gospels are reliable. For example (and I will note when this reliable information here lines up with Isaiah 53's prophecy to boot):

* **Jesus was handed over at night (Mark 14:30; John 18:3):** ""Paul has it from tradition, he says in 1 Cor 11:23, that Jesus was handed over during the night: ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ᾗ παρεδίδετο. Whatever event the apostle has in view must have happened late, because it followed the blessing over the cup, which itself took place after the evening meal (cf. 11:25: μετὰ τὸ δειπνῆσαι)"" (Dale C. Allison Jr, *Constructing Jesus*, pp. 401).
* **Jesus rejected by Israel (the authorities \[and others\]):** (Josephus, Ant. 18.3.3 \[""And when Pilate, *at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us*, condemned him to the cross""\]; 1 Thess 2:14-16 \[""For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the Jews, who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets...""\]. (This is very much in line with Isaiah's prophecy, since the speaker in 53:1-9 is Israel, and it is them who rejects the Servant.)
* **Jesus embraced death (as recorded in most of the Passion Narratives in the Gospels):** A few Pauline sentences leave the distinct impression that Jesus did not resist his fate but rather embraced it: Gal 1:4: Jesus Christ “gave \[δόντος\] himself for our sins”; Gal 2:20: he “loved me and gave \[παραδόντος\] himself for me”; Phil 2:8: “He humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross.” Dace C. Allison Jr writes: ""this cannot surprise given that, for Paul, the crucifixion was God’s intention or even, somehow, God’s doing (e.g., Rom 5:8; 8:32). Since Jesus “did not please himself” (Rom 15:3), he must have acquiesced to the divine will. Even though the texts cited are theological statements devoid of historical detail, Paul could not have written them, or at least not have written them with a clear conscience, if he had known or believed that Jesus resisted arrest or capture, or had tried to flee, or had put up a fight . . . Paul clearly believed that Jesus died willingly. Indeed, this belief was for the apostle a foundational conviction"" (ibid., 402-403). (This is very much in line with Isaiah's prophecy, as the Servant also embraces abuse and death.)
* **Jesus considered his death a benefit for all:** 1 Cor 11:23–25 attributes to Jesus the following: “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. . . . This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” These words indicate that he interpreted his demise as being somehow “for” others, as conferring a benefit, as recorded of the servant in Isaiah. (This is very much in line with Isaiah's prophecy, since the Servant bears the sins of many.)
* **Jesus predicted his death:** Again, 1 Cor 11:23–25 attributes to Jesus the following: “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. . . . This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”” According to Dale C. Allison Jr, ""these words also purport that Jesus foresaw his death, for they interpret it ahead of time, as recorded in all four Gospels"" (ibid., 403).
* **Jesus was crucified by Pontius Pilate:** (Josephus, Ant. 18.3.3 \[""And when Pilate . . . condemned him to the cross""\]; Tacitus, Annals 15:44 \[""Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus""\]). (This is in line with Isaiah's prophecy since the servant dies and was ""pierced."")
* **Jesus was buried (Mark 15:42-47; John 19:38-42):** The pre-Pauline tradition about Jesus’ death appears in 1 Cor 15:4, which asserts that Jesus was “buried” (ἐτάφη). This creed and word, ἐτάφη, rules out a burial in a mass grave for two reasons. 1) In no instance does the word θάπτω denote a burial in a mass grave in Greek or Jewish literature. 2) In no instance within Jewish literature ""does the formula, “died…and was buried,” refer to anything other than interment in the ground, a cave, or a tomb. For the source for these two assertions, see Dale C. Allison Jr, *The Resurrection of Jesus: Apologetics, Polemics, History,* T&amp;T Clark, 2021, pp. 157-158. So the creed presupposes a proper burial, just like the Gospels envision. (This is in line with Isaiah's prophecy; the servant is buried.)
* **Jesus was resurrected:** Most scholars assume that the creed of 1 Cor 15:3b-5 is independent from the Gospels (aside from perhaps gLuke), and that it is a reliable pre-Pauline tradition.

This is not to say that all of the above fulfills the prophecy (though I think some actually do quite beautifully), but this was just to demonstrate that the passion narratives in the Gospels (especially Mark and John) have a lot of history in them, so that one cannot hand wave this as just being something that the Gospels took and crafted Jesus after. In fact, Mark *never* quotes Isaiah 53. However, the material that the Pauline and secular sources do confirm, in combination with the success of Christianity in spreading worldwide, confirms that Jesus is the fulfillment of this prophecy, not even taking into account the biographies of Jesus, namely, the Gospels. In fact, it also must be mentioned that Johannine experts, against prior scholarship of the 20th century, have come to a consensus that the written account that makes up the Gospel of John was only made possible because of the eyewitness account of the Beloved Disciple (see James H. Charlesworth's *Jesus as Mirrored in John: The Genius in the New Testament*, pp. 71 for the assertion of this consensus).

# Objections

**Objection #1: But What About the Reference to The Servant Being Called Israel in Isaiah 49:3?**

Isaiah 49:3 is not saying that the Servant *is* Israel. Rather, it is saying that the Servant *functions as* Israel. H.G.M. Williamson explains:

&gt;The reason why commentaries have had such difficulty in coming to terms with this explanation is because of a perceived contradiction between verses 3 and 5-6. If the servant in verse 3 is Israel, they endlessly ask, how can he have a mission to Israel in verses 5-6? . . . **The solution lies in observing that verse 3 isn't a** ***description*** **of Israel as the servant (as thought Israel were a vocative) but is rather a** ***designation*** **of the one addressed as both servant and as Israel.** After all, if the servant has been consistently named Israel in the preceding chapters, then to call the one addressed here ‘servant’ is in fact as much a problem as it would be to call him Israel. To make clear what I mean let me paraphrase prosaically the terse parallelism of the verse He \[God\] said to me, “I now designate you as my servant; I now designate you ‘Israel’, in whom I will be glorified.” If this understanding of verse 3 is correct, then, of course, the apparent clash with verses 5-6 disappears . . . Isaiah 49:5-6 is, in fact, the last time that we hear of Jacob/Israel in chapters 40-55. (H.G.M Williamson, *Variations on a Theme: King, Messiah, and Servant in the Book of Isaiah*, 2000, pp. 150-151)

As noted above in Williamson, Isaiah 49:5-6 says the Servant will restore Israel to YHWH. So, how can the Servant be Israel here? Even Muilenburg admits as much. Sinful Israel cannot restore sinful Israel to YHWH.

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #2: Isaiah 52:13-53:12 has words in the past tense. Thus, it's not a prophecy.**

However, past tense can be about future events in what is known as a ""prophetic perfect tense,""  where a prophet speaks about future events as if they have already happened. For example, Isaiah 66:7 says:

&gt;Before she labored, she was delivered; Before her pangs came, she bore a son...

This passage in Second or Third Isaiah uses past tense words to talk about the future salvation of Israel. The end of the servant song in Isaiah 42:9 also proves that the Servant Songs are future prophecy (*before they spring forth* I tell you of them"").

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #3: Was Jesus silent before his accusers? In each of the four gospels Jesus opened his mouth and said something before his accusers.**

This just entails that the servant will not protest to God, which is what Israel several times throughout Second Isaiah. It also signifies the servant's willingness to die. John Goldingay writes:

&gt;His acceptance of affliction is then spelled out further in the reference to his silence under suffering, which is 'a strange thing in the Old Testament' (\*G. A. Smith). Under illness or the misjudgment of other people, one is expected either to cry out in protest to God and to one's oppressors, or to make confession of one's sin.

(John Goldingay, *The Message of Isaiah 40-55*, pp. 506)

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #4: Isaiah 55:3-5 reapplies the Davidic covenant to the people of Israel**

However, this widespread view is simply false. Sommer fails to read the book of Isaiah as a whole text. The messianic hope is crucial for the whole of Isaiah. Those who propound this view cannot point to one ancient Jewish interpreter who read Isaiah in this way. The basic misunderstanding is taking these passages which include redeemed Israel within the messianic promises, and reading them as a *minus* (no messiah), when in fact they are a *plus.* For the details, see Brevard Childs' commentary on Isaiah. For example, he writes:

&gt;\[There is\] great similarity between Psalm 89 and Second Isaiah, not just in terms of the tradition of an eternal covenant to David, but on a far more comprehensive scale. Many of the same words and unusual expressions are found in both: “To whom then will you liken God, or with what likeness compare him?” (Ps. 89:7 // Isa. 40:18); “who cut Rahab to pieces” (Ps. 89:11 // Isa. 51:9); “my chosen one” (Ps. 89:4 // Isa. 42:1), among others. It is most important to see in this relation that *the promise to David has not been repudiated by Second Isaiah*, but extended and transferred to the mission of the servants of the Lord in the new world order depicted by the prophet  . . . The role of the Davidic covenant in chapter 55 is a strong indication that already within Second Isaiah a link between the imagery of the servant and the messianic Davidic rule has been formed.

(Brevard Childs, *Isaiah*, pp. 613-614)

The observation that Isaiah 55 has been heavily influenced by its intertextual relations to Psalm 89 is significant. As Motyer writes:

&gt;In both Isaiah 55:3 and Psalm 89 the covenant is ‘for’ the recipient (here, ‘I will make an everlasting covenant for you’; Ps. 89:3&lt;4&gt;, ‘I have made a covenant for my chosen one’) . . . So then, Isaiah is saying ‘I will bring you \[plural\] into covenanted blessings, namely the promises to David of world rule and an enduring throne’. The plural pronoun refers back to those invited to the free banquet.

(Motyer, *The Prophecy of Isaiah*, pp. 453-454)

I also doubt that the ""signs in favour to David"" in 55:3 is confined. The heart of the promise to David is the prediction of his offspring and of his dynasty IMO. This is consistent with contemporary writings (Jer 33:14–26; Ezek 34:23–24; 37:24–28; Hag 2:20–23; Zech 3:8; 6:12), which do not transfer the promises made to David to the people. It would be strange if Isaiah 40-55 differed so much. One could also point to the promises to David being ""certain, unfailing"" in other literature to bolster the last point (2 Sam 7:15; Psalm 89:37). If one wants to show that Second and Third Isaiah differed from all of these contemporary writings, one needs better evidence than usual.

One may object and point to Isaiah 60:21, where Israel's people is called the ""branch,"" with an intertextual link with Isaiah 11:1. The problem once again, though, is that certain scholars are thinking in terms of diminution, lessening, ""transferal,"" and so forth, a minus.  A minus which is absurd in light of a whole, tightly structured book of Isaiah that features four messianic oracles in chapters 1-39.  The concept is rather a plus, one of intensification, inclusion and communion, not the messiah only, or the people without the messiah, but the messiah and people of God in union, Israel and the remnant from the nations *sharing* in the glory of YHWH and of his messiah. This explains and illumines these passages in Isaiah and the whole book of Isaiah, in a way the theory of Williamson etc. could never do. 

In sum, Blenkinsopp observes that the democratization view of Isa 55:3-5 “goes some way beyond what the author says.” He adds, “Furthermore, it is difficult to understand why this analogy \[nation to David\] would be used if the author was not persuaded of the permanence of Yahveh’s commitment to David and the dynasty.” See Joseph Blenkinsopp, *Isaiah 40–55*, Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries (New York: Doubleday, 2002), 370.",Catholicism

The Suffering Servant Songs: Evidence for Christianity,EthanCBohr,1621741068,"The Servant Songs (42:1–9; 49:1–6; 50:4–11; 52:13–53:12) are unique to Isaiah 40-55 and are four distinct poetic sections or units that function homogeneously within chapters 40–55. While identified with Israel (41:8–9) initially, the Servant is gradually revealed in Isaiah 40-55, mostly within the Servant Songs, as an individual who acts on behalf of Israel. Within these Servant songs, the Servant of YHWH is described as bringing forth new teachings (Isaiah 42:4, 6), such that he is a ""teacher"" (Isaiah 50:4), being a covenant to the peoples (Isaiah 42:6), preaching to Israel (Isaiah 49:5-6), and revealing YHWH to ""the nations"" (Isaiah 42:6; 49:1, 6; 52:15), some of which have difficulty hearing the report (Isaiah 53:1). It has been suggested that the Servant’s “sprinkling” of the nations (Isaiah 52:15) implies the redemptive significance of his work in their behalf (cf. Ware 2005, pp. 86, n. 110). The messiah in the Servant songs also grows up in a poor or non-royal background (Isaiah 53:2), he is physically abused (Isaiah 50:6; 53:3, 5), rejected by Israel (Isaiah 53:3-9), dies and is buried (Isaiah 53:7-9), bears the sins of the many (Isaiah 53:10-12), such that he is a ""guilt offering"" (Isaiah 53:10), is exalted (Isaiah 52:13), righteous (Isaiah 53:10), is equated with YHWH (Isaiah 52:13), and is resurrected (Isaiah 53:10-11). This is Jesus, and evidence of divine inspiration.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction to Isaiah 52:13-53:12**

The text starts off by saying that the Servant will be exalted by God. But, the Servant's appearance is so marred (or a ""supernatural anointing,"" as Peter Gentry translates it). If the former translation is accurate, this is just meant to antitheisize the Servant from the typical expectation of what a king was supposed to be (52:14). According to Psalm 45:3, a king must be ""fairer than the sons of men,"" but the Servant was the opposite of the appearance of a king like figure of the ANE. Moving on, many Jewish interpreters take the kings and nations in Isaiah 52:15 as the speaker for Isaiah 53:1-9. However, ""the speaker can't be the nations and kings of 52:15, because \[the text\] tells us that they had not heard a message, nor therefore had they delivered one (cf. Goldingay, *Isaiah*, kindle loc. 5876). Furthermore, as J.L. Koole points out, ""it is strange that the nations who, without previously hearing of the Servant, now pay tribute to him, would talk about 'our' unbelief. These arguments . . . confirm other exegetes in their opinion that Israel is now speaking in a confession of her failure to recognize the Servant"" (Jan L. Koole, *Isaiah 49-55,* Peeters, 1998, pp. 276). This is an amazing prophecy in light of the context this oracle was written in. Judaism was a small culture that was very small on the world stage. For the prophet to know that a person would come out of Israel to spread the greatness of YHWH across the world when the Israelites could have easily ended up like most cultures, namely, wiped out, is either a really good guess or is indicative of divine foreknowledge. But how are the nations related to the activity of the Servant in the fourth Song? James P. Ware writes:

&gt;In the opening divine oracle, many nations and kings through the Servant come to see and comprehend (52:15). Several factors indicate that the “many nations” spoken of here are understood as brought to the worship of Yahweh through the Servant. Tradition-historically, the depiction of “nations” and “kings” beholding the glory of Yahweh belongs to the eschatological pilgrimage tradition (Isa 60:3, 10, 11, 16; Ps 47:8-9; 102:15-16; 102:22; 138:4-5; cf. Ps 22:27-28; 66:1-4). Moreover, from a literary standpoint the phrase “many nations” (גּוׂיִם רַבִּים), within the final composition of the book of Isaiah, recalls the first two Servant passages (42:6, 49:6), as well as the eschatological pilgrimage oracle in Isaiah 2:2-5. In all of these passages the gentiles are the recipients of salvation, and in Isaiah 42:6 and 49:6 the means of their conversion is specifically the work of the Servant. Finally, careful repetition of key terms closely connects the opening and closing stanzas to one another, and suggests that the “many” (רַבִּים) who receive redemption through the Servant in the closing divine oracle in 53:10-12 recall and include the “many nations” (גּוׁיִם רַבִּים) of 52:13-15.

(James P. Ware, *Paul and the Mission of the Church, Philippians in Ancient Jewish Context*, pp. 76-77)

After the rejection of the Servant (Isaiah 53:3-6), the servant dies an unjust death (53:7-9). The Servant’s rejection and death than result in a righteous offspring (Isaiah 53:10) who carry out the faithful activity of the Servant in suffering and anticipation of the new creation (cf. Isaiah 57:1). The reference to the offspring is just meant to denote the children of Zion (cf. Jan L Koole, *Isaiah 49-55,* pp. 324). In other words, the ""offspring"" do not refer to literal children. The offspring promised to the Servant is the faithful remnant redeemed by him. After Isaiah 53, they are identified as “the servants of YHWH” (cf. Isaiah 54:17 and after), in the plural (56:6; 63:17; 65:8, 9, 13, 14, 15; 66:14).

The Servant than sees his offspring and sees light after his demise. For the servant to see his offspring (the Servant's Servants) and for his days to be prolonged, and for him to see light means that the Servant of YHWH was raised to life in Isaiah's thinking (see Jan L. Koole \[1998\] and Gary V. Smith \[2009\]). In fact, James P. Ware writes:

&gt;Given the generally undeveloped character of concepts of resurrection in ancient Judaism prior to the post-exilic period, a number of interpreters have questioned whether the text can actually speak of the Servant’s return to life. *However, that the Servant is portrayed in the fourth Song as restored from death to life is recognized by the majority of interpreters* **\[1\]**. The text is explicit that following his demise the Servant “will prolong days” (53:10) and “will see light” (53:11).

Isaiah also calls the Servant the ""righteous one,"" and says that he will be a guilt offering, and bear the sins of ""many."" According to Joseph Blenkinsopp, the term ‘*asham*’ in Isa. 53:10 refers to the sacrificial ritual of the guilt offering. Blenkinsopp thinks this reference is supported by indications throughout Isaiah 53, and that 'therefore the suffering and death of this Servant of the LORD is to be understood as sacrificial by analogy with the ritual of the guilt or reparation offering in the book of Leviticus' (cf. Joseph Blenkinsopp, ""The Sacrificial Life and Death of the Servant (Isaiah 52:13-53:12),"" *Vetus Testamentum 66,* 2016, [pp. 1](https://jstor.org/stable/43894343?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)).

# Is Israel the Servant of YHWH?

Some scholars and many Jewish people point to the context, where the Servant is explicitly called Israel around ten times prior to Isaiah 53 (e.g., Isaiah 41:8-9; 43:10; 44:1-2, 21; 45:4; 48:20). However, there are many indicators that prove that the Servant is not Israel as a collective. It should be emphasized that the extension of the servant’s role, especially in chapter 49, is not an attempt to replace an earlier corporate understanding of the servant Israel with that of an individual prophetic or messianic figure. Rather, the servant always remains Israel, but Israel is now understood within the dynamic movement of the prophetic history as embodied in a suffering, individual messianic figure who has been divinely commissioned to the selfsame task of the deliverance of the chosen people and the nations at large. As Brevard S. Childs puts it: ""what is crucial to observe is that one, bearing all the marks of an individual historical figure, has been named servant, not to replace corporate Israel—the servant in Second Isaiah remains inseparable from Israel—but as a faithful embodiment of the nation Israel who has not performed its chosen role (48:1–2)"" (Brevard S. Childs, *Isaiah*, pp. 541). Here are reasons why the Servant cannot be Israel as a nation or people (a collective):

1. **Relationship with Israel (cf. Isaiah 49:5-6)**: ""Is this Servant not same Israel who can bear testimony who can bear this honorary name in 41:8f., 42:19 and so many time more? Is it not precisely this tormented, tortured people that deserves the name 'man of sorrows'?... Indeed, it is true that the Servant of the Lord does not want to be isolated from the Servant Israel. On the contrary. In 49:5f. he has a very special relationship with this people, as chap. 53 also shows. But precisely this relationship excludes the identification"" (Jan L Koole, *Isaiah 49-55,* Peeters, 1998, pp. 250-251). Isaiah 49:5-6 distinguishes the Servant from Israel plainly. See below for more on this point.
2. **The Righteous Servant**: The description of the Servant as being untainted with violence or deceit is impossible to reconcile with OT's description of Israel as a nation or a people (the fourth song even labels the Servant the ""righteous one""). In 43:22-28, Israel fails to call on the Lord; in 47:6, God is angry with Israel; in 48:1-6, Israel is guilty again, with the exile and return foretold (see also 48:8b-11, 17-19); and in 50:1, God’s indictment is forthright: “for your iniquities you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away"" (synonymous with exile). As noted by Hugenberger, “Deutero-Isaiah repeatedly stresses that contemporary Israel is a sinful people who suffer on account of their own transgressions (42:18- 25; 43:22-28; 47:7; 48:18f.; 50:1; 54:7; 57:17; 59:2ff.)"" (Hugenberger, “The Servant of the Lord in the ‘Servant Songs’ of Isaiah: A Second Moses Figure,” pp. 108). This is in harmony with other literature in the OT: Amos (e.g., 4:4-12); Hosea (5:7-15); Jeremiah (32:28-36); Ezekiel (5:5- 17); Lamentations; Ezra (9:6-7); Nehemiah (9:26-36); and Zechariah (1:1-6). Thus, within the context of Second Isaiah, it is clear that the Servant cannot be Israel.
3. **""My People"":** The words, “He was cut off . . . for the transgression of my people” (53:8), distinguish the Servant from “my people,” who refers to the people of Israel. An identification of the Servant with Israel is excluded because the ‘he’ who was ‘cut off’ cannot have the same referent as ‘my people.’  In the context of Second/Third Isaiah (Isaiah 40-66), ""my people"" always refers to Israel or it's people. As Hugenberger writes: ""this conclusion holds whether or not one chooses to emend the MT, ‘my people' to read ‘his people' with 1QIsa^(a)"" (Hugenberger, “The Servant of the Lord in the ‘Servant Songs’ of Isaiah: A Second Moses Figure,” pp. 6).
4. **Mišpāṭ:** For all the evidence that the passages' arrangement invites us to infer that Jacob-Israel is the Servant, their content also hints that Jacob Israel cannot fulfil this role. As John Goldingay notes: ""the servant's task concerns the establishing of mišpāṭ; Jacob-Israel has mišpāṭ problems of its own (40.27). The Servant will not cry out in lament or protest; Jacob-Israel is doing so"" (John Goldingay, *Isaiah 40-55*, pp. 153). Compare Isaiah 49:4: ""but I said, “I \[the servant\] have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; *yet* *surely* ***my cause*** **(*****mispati*****)** *is* ***with*** *the* *Lord*, and my reward with my God.” to Isaiah 40:27: Why do you say, *O Jacob, and speak, O Israel*,“ My way is hidden from the Lord, *and* ***my right*** **(*****mispati*****)** *is* ***disregarded*** *by my God*”? In Isaiah 49:4, where the Servant affirms that, despite the setbacks he has faced, “my cause (*mispati*) is with the Lord’. This looks like a deliberate contrast with Jacob/Israel, who had earlier complained that my right (*mispati*) is disregarded by God’ (40:27).
5. **The Speaker:** ""The final objection to an identification of the Servant in the songs with corporate Israel is the observation that throughout Isaiah whenever the pronouns ‘we,’ ‘our,’ or ‘us’ are introduced abruptly, as in 53:1ff. (that is, without an explicit identification of the speakers, as in 2:3; 3:6; 4:1; etc.), it is always the prophet speaking on behalf of the people of Israel with whom he identifies (1:9f.; 16:6; 24:26; 33:2, 20; 42:24; 59:9-12; 63:15-19; 64:3-11; etc.). Accordingly, if the ‘we’ or ‘us’ in 53:1ff. is the prophet speaking on behalf of Israel, then the ‘he’ or ‘him’ of these same verses cannot also be a reference to Israel. Consistent with this observation, other considerations support an interpretation of the ‘we’ in 53:6 as a reference to Israel, with whom the prophet identifies: ‘All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way, and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.’ There are well known parallels for the comparison between Israel and sheep who have gone astray: Psalm 95:7-10; 119:176; Jeremiah 50:6. At several points within Isaiah the prophet acknowledges both his own sinfulness and the universality of sin among the people of Israel (cf. 6:5; 59:11-13; 64:5-9). Accordingly, if the ‘we’ of 53:6 is Israel with whom the prophet identifies (hence the emphatic comprehensiveness of the first person plural references: ‘all we’ and ‘us all’, the ‘him’ cannot at the same time be a reference to Israel.  ..."" (Hugenberger, “The Servant of the Lord in the ‘Servant Songs’ of Isaiah: A Second Moses Figure,” pp. 6-7).

# Is a Righteous Remnant of Israel the Servant of YHWH?

Some scholars think that the Servant refers to a righteous remnant of Israel. This interpretation, however, breaks down since:

1. The Servant is clearly an individual elsewhere in Isa 40–55, and since Isa 53 reads most naturally as personal rather than collective, there is no good reason to apply it to the righteous remnant, unless that remnant is reduced to one, the Savior of the world. That the Servant is an individual is clear. He will be a human being, conceived in and born from a mother’s womb (49:1bc), for example. In fact, while he doesn't think the Servant is the messiah, Joseph Blenkinsopp writes: ""since Christopher R. North surveyed the range of opinion on the identity of the Servant in 1948 (2d ed., 1956), no significant new options have emerged. ***While there was then and still is a strong critical preference for an individual rather than a collective interpretatio*****n**, none of the fifteen individuals named as candidates by one commentator or another and listed by North has survived scrutiny"" (Joseph Blenkinsopp, *Isaiah 40-55*, Yale University Press, 2002, pp. 355).
2. Whenever Isaiah uses the word ""servant"" in a collective sense, it is always with the addition of “Jacob” or “Israel” (Isa 41:8; 44:1, 2, 21; 45:4; 48:20) or through use of plurals alongside the singular (e.g., 43:10-14; 48:20, 21) to indicate the collective use. This is all absent in the Servant songs.
3. The point of the remnant being sinful is made specifically clear in 46:3-12; 48:1, 8; 53:6, 8; 55:7; 58:1ff.; 63:17; 64:5-7. So the same point about Israel's lack of righteousness applies here as well.
4. The suffering of the righteous remnant did not bring healing to the nations, as the Servant songs say the Servant would. The return from exile is a judgement on the nations for their excessive treatment of Israel (cf. Jer. 50:17-18; Mic. 5:5-6), The nations were not healed, and the righteous remnant caused judgment (rather than healing) to come upon their enemies (cf. Lam 1:22 and 3:61-66). So Isaiah probably didn't intend a righteous remnant of Israel to be the Servant.
5. Once again, Kool's point is relevant here. In Isaiah 53:7, the Servant is silent According to Jan L. Koole, ""the interpretation of the servant as Israel (or her best part) is hard put to explain this silence, cf. e.g., the complaints of the people in Ps. 74:1, 11 (""Why...?""), 79:5 (""How long...?""), and Israel's prayer for vengeance in Ps. 79:12; 137:4ff"" (Jan L Koole, *Isaiah 49-55,* pp. 301).

# The Servant as Messianic

Here are positive reasons to take the Servant as messianic:

**(1) Isaiah 42:1-9**: Isaiah has many royal features to it that compare to the messianic prophecy of Isaiah 11. For example, the messianic king of Isaiah 11, just like the Servant of Isaiah 42, is blessed by the Spirit of God (Isaiah 11:2; cf. 42:1) to establish justice (Isaiah 11:3-5; cf. 42:3-4). But if Isaiah 42 is messianic, so to are the rest of the Servant songs (the same is true for Isaiah 49 and 50). The idea of ""springing up"" (*tiṣmaḥnāh*) in Isaiah 42:9 also points to the messianic identity of the servant in Isaiah 42, an thus for the rest of the servant songs. It is probably not accidental that the noun form derived from this root (*ṣmḥ*) refers to the ""Branch"" of the Lord (4:2; Jer 23:5; 33:15; Zech 3:8), a term employed for the Davidic Messiah in the OT. Even the Aramaic Targum and portions of 1 Enoch interpreted the Servant Song in Isaiah 42 as messianic, which is early evidence indeed.

&amp;#x200B;

**(2) Kingly Traits:** Kingly traits in the figure of the servant are apparent. The Servant is to free the prisoners from dungeon (42:7, 49:9), to lead back the tribes of Jacob (49:6), and to reapportion the waste lands of Palestine (49:8). He is effectively the Israelite king, though the expression is avoided. Another feature that hints at a Davidic messiah is the reference to a rich burial, which is typically suitable for a royal person. The Servant is even placed over, against, and raised above other political leaders (see Isaiah 49:7; 52:13; 53:12. The Servant is therefore the ideal king - the messiah. See Daniel I. Block ""My Servant David,"" in  *Israel's Messiah in the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls,* pp. 50 (n. 145). If Block is right, than the reference to the Servant's ""supernatural anointing"" (52:14) would also be a powerful hint towards the Servant being a Davidic messiah.

&amp;#x200B;

**(3) Isaiah 53:2:** Isaiah 53:2 hints that the passage is messianic. Compare Isaiah 53:2:

&gt;""For he grew up before him like a ***young shoot***, and *like a* ***root*** ***(šōreš)*** *out of dry ground.""*

to Isaiah 11:1, 10:

&gt;""***A shoot*** shall come out from the stump of Jesse...,"" and 11:10: ""On that day *the* ***root (šōreš)*** *of Jesse* shall stand as a signal to the peoples; the nations shall inquire of him...""

Isaiah 53:2 parallels Isaiah 11:1, 10. Klaus Baltzer writes: ""Shoot/branch” (יוֹנֵק) and “root” (שֹׁרֶשׁ) associate this passage with the “messianic” prophecy in Isa 11:1–9, 10"" (Klaus Baltzer, *Deutero-Isaiah*, Hermeneia, 2001, pp. 404).

&amp;#x200B;

**(4) Earliest Interpretation:** The earliest, or at least one of the earliest interpretations of Isaiah 52:13-53:12 is the Book of Daniel, and it is messianic. It is highly significant that there are many remarkable lexical and thematic links in Dan 9:24-27 that enable us the Messiah in Dan 9 to the suffering Servant in Isaiah 52:13-53:12: (1) three major sin terms; (2) *Niphal* (""cut off""); (3) (""no help for him""); (4) the allusion from Dan. 12:3 (‘those who justify the many’) to Isa. 53:11 (‘he shall justify the many’). Daniel 11-12 also seems dependent on Isaiah 52:13-53:12. Zechariah also seems to have interpreted the Servant Songs as messianic. A case can be made out for the messianic passages in Zechariah 12 and 13 making allusion to Isaiah (e.g., the piercing and rejection of the messiah by Israel in 12:10, and the sheep which go astray in Isa. 53:6 to the scattered flock of Zech. 13:7). See Daniel I. Block ""My Servant David,"" in  *Israel's Messiah in the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls,* pp. 51 for more on this link between Zechariah and Isaiah 53. This is very probative evidence indeed.

&amp;#x200B;

**(5) The Servant as a Deity:** Compare Isaiah 52:13:

&gt;Behold, my servant shall act wisely; *he shall be* ***high and lifted up***, and shall be exalted. (ESV)

to Isaiah 6:1:

&gt;In the year that King Uzziah died *I saw the Lord* sitting upon a throne, ***high and lifted up***; and the train of his robe filled the temple. (ESV)

and to Isaiah 57:15:

&gt;For thus says *the One who is* ***high and lifted up***... (ESV)

""Isaiah 52:13 states, with emphasis, the exaltation of the Servant, presumably following the humiliation and death described in the following passage. There are two points to notice about it: (1) The words 'exalted' and 'lifted up' ('my Servant shall be exalted and lifted up') occur also in Isaiah 6:1, introducing Isaiah's vision of God on his throne (where the throne is described as 'exalted and lifted up'), and in Isaiah 57:15, which describes God, dwelling in the heights of heaven, as himself 'exalted and lifted up'. The combination of the two Hebrew roots rum ('to be high; 'to be exalted') and *nasa'* ('to lift up') is rare in the Hebrew Bible, and the verbal coincidence between these three verses is striking. Modern Old Testament scholars think the two later passages, Isaiah 52:13 and 57:15, must be dependent on Isaiah 6:1"" (Bauckham, *Jesus And The God Of Israel,* pp. 50-51). Wilcox and Paton Williams observe, ‘Throughout Isaiah 1–66, the adjectives “exalted”, “lifted up” and “very high” are virtually technical terms, applied almost exclusively to Yahweh' (Peter Wilcox and David Paton-Williams, ‘The Servant Songs in Deutero-Isaiah’, *JSOT* 42 \[1988\], pp. 95). In fact, according to [this article](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/scottish-journal-of-theology/article/abs/who-is-isaiahs-servant-narrative-identity-and-theological-potentiality/AA7056349C36CC87EE69E4AEF07C7A17):

&gt;Isaiah 52:13 LXX chooses the term ‘glorification’ (δoξασθησται ´ ) for the ‘greatly exalted’ ( ) of the MT. Elsewhere in Isaiah the prophetic word has emphasised twice over that YHWH’s glory belongs to none other than himself (Isaiah 42:8; 48:11). ‘I will give my glory to no other’. Yet in Isaiah 52:13, the Servant is narratively depicted as one who is sharing in what belongs to YHWH alone, that is, his glory. (pp. 132)

All of this suggests the Servant is a deity, in line with Isaiah 9:6, which speaks of a Davidic messianic ruler. [Isaiah 9:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+9%3A6-7&amp;version=NRSV) says that a son (the messiah) will be called ""el gibbor"" (Mighty God). In Isaiah 9:6-7, the initial announcement that a child “is born” (*yullad*) is a prophetic perfect verb to bring the reader to look back in time *from the future* (cf. J. Alec Motyer, *The Prophecy of Isaiah*, pp. 97). The prophetic nature of this text is proven by the future tense at the end of Isaiah 9:7, including the reference to the son's birth (""The zeal of the Lord of hosts *will* do this""). The description of the child cannot be applied to a merely human king - a 'God like warrior,"" as opposed to a deity. In fact, wherever the term ‘Mighty God’ (*el gibbor*) is used, *it is used exclusively (aside from one later example) for YHWH in the Hebrew Bible*. This is clear elsewhere, where no doubt the term refers to YHWH (cf. Deut. 10:17; Jer. 32:18). In fact, Isaiah uses the same exact words for the YHWH Himself in 10:20-21 in the very next chapter! Isaiah 10:21 says: ""a remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the *mighty God""* *(el gibbor).* This is very good evidence that ""*el gibbor*"" is not a theophoric name, but is saying that the person in question (the son of Isaiah 9:6) will be called YHWH Himself, going beyond a theophoric name (cf. John Goldingay, *Isaiah*, New International Biblical Commentary \[Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2001\], pp. 73). There is one example from Ezekiel 32:21 where *el gibbor* is not used for YHWH. However, there are three arguments against the relevance of this text:

1. It's from a later text from the 6th century BCE that does not cohere with the earliest usage of the terms.
2. Unlike Isaiah, the term ""el gibbor"" in Ezekiel is plural and overtly linked in a genitive relation.
3. Isaiah's own usage of the phrase in Isaiah 10:21 demonstrates the likelihood of ""el gibbor"" in Isa 9:6 referring to YHWH.

Thus, this oracle is saying that the son will be called YHWH. Unless Isaiah thought that Hezekiah or some other human figure around his time was his God (YHWH), there is little reason to think that Isaiah was speaking of Hezekiah or any other contemporary king or son of a king here. There is no evidence that Isaiah or his disciples that added material to 'First Isaiah' worshipped any deity but YHWH. Rather, Isaiah was speaking of an ideal future messiah being called YHWH in Isaiah 9.

# Did The Gospel Authors Make Jesus Fit This Prophecy?

However, it is extremely probable that the basic narrative behind Jesus' passion is historical, so that, even if every single detail is *not* historical in the Gospels, this is still a prophecy fulfilled. I think the Gospel authors more so cited the OT in light of historical events instead of creating events out of the OT (besides for perhaps the Gospel of Matthew). This can be shown by what scholars consider reliable sources (Paul, Josephus, and Tacitus). Paul, Josephus and Tacitus give enough information to show that the core narrative in the Gospels are reliable. For example (and I will note when this reliable information here lines up with Isaiah 53's prophecy to boot):

* **Jesus was handed over at night (Mark 14:30; John 18:3):** ""Paul has it from tradition, he says in 1 Cor 11:23, that Jesus was handed over during the night: ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ᾗ παρεδίδετο. Whatever event the apostle has in view must have happened late, because it followed the blessing over the cup, which itself took place after the evening meal (cf. 11:25: μετὰ τὸ δειπνῆσαι)"" (Dale C. Allison Jr, *Constructing Jesus*, pp. 401).
* **Jesus rejected by Israel (the authorities \[and others\]):** (Josephus, Ant. 18.3.3 \[""And when Pilate, *at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us*, condemned him to the cross""\]; 1 Thess 2:14-16 \[""For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the Jews, who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets...""\]. (This is very much in line with Isaiah's prophecy, since the speaker in 53:1-9 is Israel, and it is them who rejects the Servant.)
* **Jesus embraced death (as recorded in most of the Passion Narratives in the Gospels):** A few Pauline sentences leave the distinct impression that Jesus did not resist his fate but rather embraced it: Gal 1:4: Jesus Christ “gave \[δόντος\] himself for our sins”; Gal 2:20: he “loved me and gave \[παραδόντος\] himself for me”; Phil 2:8: “He humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross.” Dace C. Allison Jr writes: ""this cannot surprise given that, for Paul, the crucifixion was God’s intention or even, somehow, God’s doing (e.g., Rom 5:8; 8:32). Since Jesus “did not please himself” (Rom 15:3), he must have acquiesced to the divine will. Even though the texts cited are theological statements devoid of historical detail, Paul could not have written them, or at least not have written them with a clear conscience, if he had known or believed that Jesus resisted arrest or capture, or had tried to flee, or had put up a fight . . . Paul clearly believed that Jesus died willingly. Indeed, this belief was for the apostle a foundational conviction"" (ibid., 402-403). (This is very much in line with Isaiah's prophecy, as the Servant also embraces abuse and death.)
* **Jesus considered his death a benefit for all:** 1 Cor 11:23–25 attributes to Jesus the following: “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. . . . This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” These words indicate that he interpreted his demise as being somehow “for” others, as conferring a benefit, as recorded of the servant in Isaiah. (This is very much in line with Isaiah's prophecy, since the Servant bears the sins of many.)
* **Jesus predicted his death:** Again, 1 Cor 11:23–25 attributes to Jesus the following: “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. . . . This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”” According to Dale C. Allison Jr, ""these words also purport that Jesus foresaw his death, for they interpret it ahead of time, as recorded in all four Gospels"" (ibid., 403).
* **Jesus was crucified by Pontius Pilate:** (Josephus, Ant. 18.3.3 \[""And when Pilate . . . condemned him to the cross""\]; Tacitus, Annals 15:44 \[""Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus""\]). (This is in line with Isaiah's prophecy since the servant dies and was ""pierced."")
* **Jesus was buried (Mark 15:42-47; John 19:38-42):** The pre-Pauline tradition about Jesus’ death appears in 1 Cor 15:4, which asserts that Jesus was “buried” (ἐτάφη). This creed and word, ἐτάφη, rules out a burial in a mass grave for two reasons. 1) In no instance does the word θάπτω denote a burial in a mass grave in Greek or Jewish literature. 2) In no instance within Jewish literature ""does the formula, “died…and was buried,” refer to anything other than interment in the ground, a cave, or a tomb. For the source for these two assertions, see Dale C. Allison Jr, *The Resurrection of Jesus: Apologetics, Polemics, History,* T&amp;T Clark, 2021, pp. 157-158. So the creed presupposes a proper burial, just like the Gospels envision. (This is in line with Isaiah's prophecy; the servant is buried.)
* **Jesus was resurrected:** Most scholars assume that the creed of 1 Cor 15:3b-5 is independent from the Gospels (aside from perhaps gLuke), and that it is a reliable pre-Pauline tradition.

This is not to say that all of the above fulfills the prophecy (though I think some actually do quite beautifully), but this was just to demonstrate that the passion narratives in the Gospels (especially Mark and John) have a lot of history in them, so that one cannot hand wave this as just being something that the Gospels took and crafted Jesus after. In fact, Mark *never* quotes Isaiah 53. However, the material that the Pauline and secular sources do confirm, in combination with the success of Christianity in spreading worldwide, confirms that Jesus is the fulfillment of this prophecy, not even taking into account the biographies of Jesus, namely, the Gospels. In fact, it also must be mentioned that Johannine experts, against prior scholarship of the 20th century, have come to a consensus that the written account that makes up the Gospel of John was only made possible because of the eyewitness account of the Beloved Disciple (see James H. Charlesworth's *Jesus as Mirrored in John: The Genius in the New Testament*, pp. 71 for the assertion of this consensus).

# Objections

**Objection #1: But What About the Reference to The Servant Being Called Israel in Isaiah 49:3?**

Isaiah 49:3 is not saying that the Servant *is* Israel. Rather, it is saying that the Servant *functions as* Israel. H.G.M. Williamson explains:

&gt;The reason why commentaries have had such difficulty in coming to terms with this explanation is because of a perceived contradiction between verses 3 and 5-6. If the servant in verse 3 is Israel, they endlessly ask, how can he have a mission to Israel in verses 5-6? . . . **The solution lies in observing that verse 3 isn't a** ***description*** **of Israel as the servant (as thought Israel were a vocative) but is rather a** ***designation*** **of the one addressed as both servant and as Israel.** After all, if the servant has been consistently named Israel in the preceding chapters, then to call the one addressed here ‘servant’ is in fact as much a problem as it would be to call him Israel. To make clear what I mean let me paraphrase prosaically the terse parallelism of the verse He \[God\] said to me, “I now designate you as my servant; I now designate you ‘Israel’, in whom I will be glorified.” If this understanding of verse 3 is correct, then, of course, the apparent clash with verses 5-6 disappears . . . Isaiah 49:5-6 is, in fact, the last time that we hear of Jacob/Israel in chapters 40-55. (H.G.M Williamson, *Variations on a Theme: King, Messiah, and Servant in the Book of Isaiah*, 2000, pp. 150-151)

As noted above in Williamson, Isaiah 49:5-6 says the Servant will restore Israel to YHWH. So, how can the Servant be Israel here? Even Muilenburg admits as much. Sinful Israel cannot restore sinful Israel to YHWH.

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #2: Isaiah 52:13-53:12 has words in the past tense. Thus, it's not a prophecy.**

However, past tense can be about future events in what is known as a ""prophetic perfect tense,""  where a prophet speaks about future events as if they have already happened. For example, Isaiah 66:7 says:

&gt;Before she labored, she was delivered; Before her pangs came, she bore a son...

This passage in Second or Third Isaiah uses past tense words to talk about the future salvation of Israel. The end of the servant song in Isaiah 42:9 also proves that the Servant Songs are future prophecy (*before they spring forth* I tell you of them"").

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #3: Was Jesus silent before his accusers? In each of the four gospels Jesus opened his mouth and said something before his accusers.**

This just entails that the servant will not protest to God, which is what Israel several times throughout Second Isaiah. It also signifies the servant's willingness to die. John Goldingay writes:

&gt;His acceptance of affliction is then spelled out further in the reference to his silence under suffering, which is 'a strange thing in the Old Testament' (\*G. A. Smith). Under illness or the misjudgment of other people, one is expected either to cry out in protest to God and to one's oppressors, or to make confession of one's sin.

(John Goldingay, *The Message of Isaiah 40-55*, pp. 506)

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #4: Isaiah 55:3-5 reapplies the Davidic covenant to the people of Israel**

However, this widespread view is simply false. Sommer fails to read the book of Isaiah as a whole text. The messianic hope is crucial for the whole of Isaiah. Those who propound this view cannot point to one ancient Jewish interpreter who read Isaiah in this way. The basic misunderstanding is taking these passages which include redeemed Israel within the messianic promises, and reading them as a *minus* (no messiah), when in fact they are a *plus.* For the details, see Brevard Childs' commentary on Isaiah. For example, he writes:

&gt;\[There is\] great similarity between Psalm 89 and Second Isaiah, not just in terms of the tradition of an eternal covenant to David, but on a far more comprehensive scale. Many of the same words and unusual expressions are found in both: “To whom then will you liken God, or with what likeness compare him?” (Ps. 89:7 // Isa. 40:18); “who cut Rahab to pieces” (Ps. 89:11 // Isa. 51:9); “my chosen one” (Ps. 89:4 // Isa. 42:1), among others. It is most important to see in this relation that *the promise to David has not been repudiated by Second Isaiah*, but extended and transferred to the mission of the servants of the Lord in the new world order depicted by the prophet. In a word, Second Isaiah has incorporated the messianic promise to David in First Isaiah into a new version of God’s future rule . . . The role of the Davidic covenant in chapter 55 is a strong indication that already within Second Isaiah a link between the imagery of the servant and the messianic Davidic rule has been formed.

(Brevard Childs, *Isaiah*, pp. 613-614)

The observation that Isaiah 55 has been heavily influenced by its intertextual relations to Psalm 89 is significant. As Motyer writes:

&gt;In both Isaiah 55:3 and Psalm 89 the covenant is ‘for’ the recipient (here, ‘I will make an everlasting covenant for you’; Ps. 89:3&lt;4&gt;, ‘I have made a covenant for my chosen one’) . . . So then, Isaiah is saying ‘I will bring you \[plural\] into covenanted blessings, namely the promises to David of world rule and an enduring throne’. The plural pronoun refers back to those invited to the free banquet.

(Motyer, *The Prophecy of Isaiah*, pp. 453-454)

I also doubt that the ""signs in favour to David"" in 55:3 is confined. The heart of the promise to David is the prediction of his offspring and of his dynasty IMO. This is consistent with contemporary writings (Jer 33:14–26; Ezek 34:23–24; 37:24–28; Hag 2:20–23; Zech 3:8; 6:12), which do not transfer the promises made to David to the people. It would be strange if Isaiah 40-55 differed so much. One could also point to the promises to David being ""certain, unfailing"" in other literature to bolster the last point (2 Sam 7:15; Psalm 89:37). If one wants to show that Second and Third Isaiah differed from all of these contemporary writings, one needs better evidence than usual.

One may object and point to Isaiah 60:21, where Israel's people is called the ""branch,"" with an intertextual link with Isaiah 11:1. The problem once again, though, is that certain scholars are thinking in terms of diminution, lessening, ""transferal,"" and so forth, a minus.  A minus which is absurd in light of a whole, tightly structured book of Isaiah that features four messianic oracles in chapters 1-39.  The concept is rather a plus, one of intensification, inclusion and communion, not the messiah only, or the people without the messiah, but the messiah and people of God in union, Israel and the remnant from the nations *sharing* in the glory of YHWH and of his messiah. This explains and illumines these passages in Isaiah and the whole book of Isaiah, in a way the theory of Williamson etc. could never do. 

In sum, Blenkinsopp observes that the democratization view of Isa 55:3-5 “goes some way beyond what the author says.” He adds, “Furthermore, it is difficult to understand why this analogy \[nation to David\] would be used if the author was not persuaded of the permanence of Yahveh’s commitment to David and the dynasty.” See Joseph Blenkinsopp, *Isaiah 40–55*, Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries (New York: Doubleday, 2002), 370.",Catholicism

3. They surrender and allow themselves to be arrested, a mock trial, and eventually die anyways.

What would you think of a chaste version of the pride flag/movement?,Onedirection32,1621732699,"So while Catholics support LGBTQ+ individuals, we don’t support pride flags or pride parades because it implies things like sodomy and same-sex marriage (on top of the respect for LGBTQ people). But what if orthodox LGBTQ Catholics (as well as LGBTQ people from other religions and atheists who want to remain chaste) designed a new flag/movement where it’s clear that they support LGBTQ people and respect them but don’t approve of unchaste behaviour? Such an approach could allow Catholics and Catholic institutions to show their support for the LGBTQ community without either causing scandal (by flying the pride flag) or appearing homophobic (by not flying anything at all). This is obviously assuming such a flag would be carefully designed so that it’s clear that it implies chastity and isn’t just a variation of the pride flag.

I know there are already organizations like Courage International, but they only seem to be targeted towards Catholics and not as a form of evangelization/spreading the Church’s teachings on sexuality to society as a whole (after all, we believe same-sex sexual activity is objectively immoral for everyone, not just for Catholics). They have the crucifix as a symbol, but the crucifix can have so many meanings and implies only Catholics are called to chastity. A movement/symbol like this could spread easily on social media and be adopted by non-Catholic or nonreligious LGBTQ people.

What’s everyone’s thoughts on this? Could this be a good way to show acceptance for LGBTQ people while advocating for chastity throughout society, or is it still in some way problematic?",Catholicism

"My priest today wore a pectoral of Pope John Paul II. Why wouldn’t this be the current Pope, Francis?",pearlsnvodka,1621730483,"Hi everybody. I only started going to Mass again earlier this year after more than a decade hiaitus. Right now I kind of split my time between two parishes that are very different from one another as I navigate which “flavor” resonates more with me now that I am older. One is a church with a very progressive, older group of parishioners, with a focus on social justice in the community and great homilies. The other is an actual Basilica, very traditional, incredibly beautiful, basically coming as close to Latin Mass as you’re going to get in English. I go to the downtown church most weekdays and the traditional church on Sundays.

I’m not as knowledgeable about this stuff as most of the folks on this sub and I know I’m not going to use the right terminology but hopefully I’m making it clear what I’m trying to ask.

Today I went to the Basilica for the vigil for the solemnity of Pentecost. While the priests at this church traditionally do wear fancier outfits (despite being a Franciscan parish, which kind of confuses me?) the head priest was wearing a unique one today. It was deep red with gold embroidery and in the center, on his chest, was Pope John Paul II. Of course I know we use different colors and such for different seasons, feasts, etc. but the pectoral is what interested me.

This led me to some interesting questions, but most of all, I’m wondering why he’d wear an image of a past pope and not the current Pope Francis. Does it have anything to do with this being a more traditional group of Catholics? Or was Pope John Paul II some special symbolism with Pentecost? This was probably the first time I ever went to a Pentecost service so I honestly don’t know.

I don’t want this to devolve into a conversation about Francis being the anti-Pope like I’ve seen on this sub elsewhere, there is a portrait of him hanging in the nave so I know it wasn’t some sort of political statement against him.",Catholicism

Question about genealogies of Christ,not_gizmoz,1621727953,"I'm reading though the [Catholic Answers response](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/the-genealogies-of-christ) on the ""problem"" of the two genealogies of Christ. It makes sense but there's is a part in it that I don't understand.

It reads:

&gt;The next obvious difference is that both genealogies trace Jesus’  lineage back to David, but through different sons. Matthew has Christ descending from David through Solomon, while Luke has him descending from David through Nathan. **This is not odd. David had more than one son, and a later individual can be descended from more than one of them.**  

Also later:

&gt;...Matthew traces Christ’s lineage through Zerubbabel’s son Abiud, while Luke traces it through a different son, Rhesa. **Again, this is not  odd. Zerubbabel simply had more than one son, and Christ was descended  from both.**  

I'm probably just missing something here but this makes no sense to me. How can it be said that Jesus would descend though both Solomon and Nathan?

To me, it would be either:

(...) -&gt; David -&gt; Solomon -&gt; (...) -&gt; Jesus

Or:

(...) -&gt; David -&gt; Nathan -&gt; (...) -&gt; Jesus

Not:

(...) -&gt; David -&gt; Solomon and Nathan -&gt; (...) -&gt; Jesus

Because it would be incorrect to say that my brother's hypothetical great-grandson has descended ""through me"".

"Reasons and context for Confession, the Eucharist actually being Jesus, and Church authority.",DependentShirt8089,1621718878,"I have a really good friend who grew up a cultural Catholic.  He used to go to Mass with me half heartedly.  Now he’s a Protestant (been to everything from Southern Baptist, to now Church of Christ).  We have been talking and I told him he needs to come back to Catholicism.  I don’t think I’m very convincing though.  Just wanted to make sure I understand these teachings.

Some Church teachings have been admittedly hard for me but I think I can  defend why we believe what we do.

Please correct me if I am wrong on these teachings.

Confession is the act of confessing our sins to a priest.  We confess to a priest because Jesus gave the authority to the apostles in John 20:23.

Eucharist establishment is twofold.  Firstly. “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.” (John 6:53–55)

Secondly: he fulfills this at the last supper and commands it continue.

Church authority: to me this is the easiest to understand.  “You are peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against her”.  God gave authority to the 12 to build and be guided by the Holy Spirit.  I am not sure how this authority gets confusing.

St. Pious and Pope Francis encyclicals are contradictory?,_negativecr33p_,1621715656,"Pope Francis, in his encyclical, Evangeli Gaudium n.247, says that the alliance between jews and God is still valid, but, St. Pious XII in June of 1943, will state in the Mystici Corpus Christi:

""29. And first of all, by the death of our Redeemer, the New Testament took the place of the Old Law which had been abolished; then the Law of Christ together with its mysteries, enactments, institutions, and sacred rites was ratified for the whole world in the blood of Jesus Christ. For, while our Divine Savior was preaching in a restricted area - He was not sent but to the sheep that were lost of the House of Israel [30] - the Law and the Gospel were together in force; [31] but on the gibbet of His death Jesus made void the Law with its decrees [32] fastened the handwriting of the Old Testament to the Cross, [33] establishing the New Testament in His blood shed for the whole human race.[34] ""To such an extent, then,"" says St. Leo the Great, speaking of the Cross of our Lord, ""was there effected a transfer from the Law to the Gospel, from the Synagogue to the Church, from the many sacrifices to one Victim, that, as Our Lord expired, that mystical veil which shut off the innermost part of the temple and its sacred secret was rent violently from top to bottom."" [35]""

Evidently, St Pious XII states that the old law was abolished, therefore, the old covenant died to the New Covenant to take place. But Pope Francis will say quite the oposite:

"" 247. We hold the Jewish people in special regard because their covenant with God has never been revoked, for “the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable” (Rom 11:29). The Church, which shares with Jews an important part of the sacred Scriptures, looks upon the people of the covenant and their faith as one of the sacred roots of her own Christian identity (cf. Rom 11:16-18). As Christians, we cannot consider Judaism as a foreign religion; nor do we include the Jews among those called to turn from idols and to serve the true God (cf. 1 Thes 1:9). With them, we believe in the one God who acts in history, and with them we accept his revealed word.""

The extent of free will.,New_General_6287,1621708395,"I am starting to less and less believe free will is a thing. We do not choose our parents, place of birth or if we are alive to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is also 'vocation' which it's not like you choose that and as you age you slowly realize that the choice basically always boils down to 'keep doing that optimal thing, or do stupid thing'. You become locked into a single path in life you either follow optimally or fail to do so, with consciously choosing to deviate from that always being stupid. On the other hand you sometimes deviate from it due to things outside of your control robbed of choice and free will as well.

God himself too has given us a fictitious free will to disobey him. We can disobey him, we can shun him, but that is always the stupid choice as that results in eternal torment.

If you intend to comfort a person by telling them that they are not alone, it is my hope that you make an extra effort to follow up with meaningful action. 

When a lonely person hears this phrase but then the person who says it just ends the conversation and then goes on their way, it opens the wound further and causes more harm.

Perhaps instead of saying you are not alone, show the person they are not alone by being present to them in their need. Invite them for coffee or to your Bible study. Introduce them to people you know. Get them connected to others in the community. Words are not enough.

For instance, my sister had broken away from the faith years ago as a result of her pride and the obvious result of her pride became depression, so as a way to alleviate her suffering she’s turned to marijuana instead of Christ. This, at least to me, seems to be the deal with many of my friends who have turned to smoking pot to alleviate their suffering. I know some people are able to use it daily and have no negative consequences, but most of my friends and family who are following the “medicinal marijuana” narrative have become complacent in the fact of marijuana practically being their savior. 

I guess I’m partially speaking from experience since I pretty much followed the same path as my sister; I was super prideful and denied my faith because I thought I was being cool or hip or edgy or something like that, I don’t know for sure, I gave into all of the hype about treating naturalism and the state and marijuana as being ultimate goods and as a result a horrible experience (which turned out to be a gift from God) humbled me enough to realize how wrong I was.

How Degraded We’ve Become,StaindGlassLover,1621695948,"I just saw a post about when the Church will change its stance on same-sex couples.  

The Church, or any religious organization, has failed so completely in teaching what detachment is. 

I asked my 18 year old son, “What’s worse in God’s Eyes? A father abandoning his wife and family for younger woman or a high school student developing a same sex relationship?”

The whole discussion never addresses what God wants. It never states the purpose of sexuality. It it only looks at the definition of LOVE in a post-modern era. It never recognizes that the human soul is so much more than our base desires. 

The Bible, to my limited knowledge, only forbids homosexual relationships positively three times. But it frequently doubles down on that with the definition of a man and woman being paired together. Jesus constantly affirms this, but goes further with His commands in Matthew.

How To Let Go Of Sin?,KKeomitt,1621683172,"Hello,

I (17F) kind of in a weird situation where my father is Catholic but my mother is a Protestant. I have been baptised but I haven’t been to church since I was 10 years old because my parents are separated and I live with my mother (neither are remarried because they think it’s adulterous, though). I’m not sure if I’m still Catholic anymore but feel free to remove my post if I’m not.

Anyway, I have been struggling longterm with the exact same 2 sins. You know what they are — it goes hand in hand with lust. I haven’t been able to go to confession though because my mother refuses to go to a church and I live in an area with basically no transport links apart from a car. I’ve tried repenting privately but I’m not sure if God is accepting them because I’be basically kept repeating the sins and I’m not sure if I’m actually repenting because I sad about having offended God.

I’m really scared that I’m basically living in a state of mortal sin and it’s making me so stressed that I actually feel really ill all of the time. I know that God doesn’t listen to you prayers if you don’t let go of your sins but I’m not sure how to let go of them. I will go for several days/weeks but then commit the same 2 sins and it’s really stressful.

I feel like God is probably really mad at me and it makes me feel sad/ill and I don’t really knoW what to do.

"""Death is not an appropriate subject to talk about""",Falandorn,1621676871,"I live with my wife and mother-in-law and they **hate** any reference to death. My wife's not religious and my mother-in-law is High Church. I have been screamed at, literally screamed at before for making light of it through conversation. I do hold my hand up to provocation at times as I'm weak.



I read a lot of the lives of saints and they constantly reflect on their own deaths and gladly anticipate the chance to be with God and away from this exile. Personally I love talking about it and have a real fascination with the subject, particularly around the way death has been air-brushed out of developed countries and their cultures.


Poverty and people who live in poverty in developing countries are very familiar with death, they see it daily and many live closely alongside death with bodies of homeless littering the streets each day. For them death is completely natural and expected and accepted even. 


Our culture in the west is thoroughly removed from death now, it is hushed up and not talked about, sadly not even from the pulpit anymore lest the priest upset amyone! It's a secret that we blindly leave to ignorance until someone dies, then they are quickly buried and forgotten and we move on living.


It was said Satan's best trick was convincing the world he doesn't exist, as he represents death I actually think he has done a pretty admirable job convincing modern society that death doesn't exist either. 


My wife gets upset with me to the point of me now avoiding the subject completely, in the past she has referred to Catholicism as a death cult obsessed with the next life. I probably haven't helped by my willingness to discuss it and my excitement at the prospect. I *love* life, it really is beautiful but I feel no attachment to it if that makes sense. I would gladly skip it to enjoy everlasting life if I was no longer of benefit to God and His plan for salvation on earth.


I must say this is not a morbid fascination with the dead, I pray for the Holy Souls but don't spend time researching death or any of that. It's more a desire to be with God, just to clear that up and I would never make out I hate this life or can't wait for it to end either, that's not true, I just look forward to eternity without evil.

How would you describe your relationship with The Virgin Mary?,ChrisKleinFanGirl,1621676743,"Background on me; Became a Christian in 2017 and mixed in Protestant circles for a while (Mostly Pentecostal/Charismatic) Became to realise the false theology and heresies and investigate Church history, Now I am torn between Catholicism and Orthodoxy (Leaning towards the latter) But something I really struggle with is Honouring/praying to the Virgin Mary/Theotokos.

Possibly because during my time in Protestantism it was quite well engrained on me (even in a short space of time) that The Virgin Mary was ""just a woman"" and to consider her any differently is was idol worship. Even depictions of her make me feel uneasy, and I really wish they didn't! The virgin Mary was only ever spoken about as part of the nativity story and even then it was just to show how obedient she was.

Now wait a minute, that sounds off, isn’t there somewhere in Matthew where Christ says “the son of man has the authority to forgive sins”? Maybe I’m quoting that wrong but I thought he said something to that effect. Now ofc Jesus can forgive sins Christ is in essence god in human nature.

But he didn’t say (last time I checked) that “the son of god had the authority to forgive sins” last time I checked the gospel quotes him saying “the son of man has the authority to forgive sins.”

Am I actually reading this in my New American Bible right now or am I having a stroke?,wordinthetime,1621656842,"In a preface to the book of Genesis:

""The plot of Genesis 2-11 has been borrowed from creation flood stories attested in Mesopotamian literature of the second and early first millennia. In the Mesopotamian creation flood stories, the gods created the human race as slaves whose task it was to manage the universe for them – giving them food, clothing, and honor in temple ceremonies. In an unforeseen development however, the human race grew so numerous and noisy that the gods could not sleep. Deeply angered, the gods decided to destroy the race by a universal flood. One man and his family, however, secretly warned of the flood by his patron god, built a boat and survived. Soon regretting their impetuous decision, the gods created a revised version of humankind. The new race was created mortal so they would never again grow numerous and bother the gods. The authors of Genesis adapted the creation flood story in accord with their views of God and humanity. For example, they attributed the fault to human sin rather than to divine miscalculation and had God reaffirm without change the original creation. In the biblical version God is just, powerful, and not needy. How should modern readers interpret the creation flood story? The stories are neither history nor myth. Myth is an unsuitable term, for it has several different meanings and connotations of untruth. History is equally misleading, for it suggests that the events actually took place.""",Catholicism

For me, it's not so much the procession of the statue through the church that bothers me, its the congregation's reaction to the fall. It's just a statue, and it falling off is in no way indicative of divine displeasure, or that the people carrying the statue have committed some grave statue, or anything else requiring this clamour.

I accept that, in principle, there is a difference between honouring a religious statute and the true Honour which is due to God alone, but when I see a scene like this, it seems like a very foreign religious culture that hasn't absorbed the fact that these are just statues.

Our SSA are the side effects of this downfall, Eves disobedience. Not from God. This should be like a basic understanding for us SSA side B christians who are serious in the faith.right?


But they keep repeating ""He made me gay"" they reduce themselves to a Sexual Atraction. They seem to not have any other qualities in their personality, no mention of their virtues as God created.

Bl. Fulton Sheen preached to the US for years on live public television and however great a man he was it didn't matter, we have seen a dramatic decline in faith, and his particular audience grew up religious and has ended quite the opposite.

I am writing as I am in dire need of some help. I am a practicing Christian who is crippled with anxiety and cowardice. I am afraid of publicly evangelizing my faith for fear of the world attacking me although on an individual level I have no issues sharing the faith. 

The thought of standing on the street and preaching gives me goosebumps and I do not want to be seen as a coward. This also comes with praying the rosary out loud in public although I have no issue praying in silence. I understand the severity of this and how Jesus warned that cowardice leads to hell but I for the life of me cannot seem to get this anxiety out of me. I have had mental trauma and childhood trauma my whole life which gives me social anxiety along with depression and self doubt. 

I have actively repented of porn, masturbation, fornication etc.. but the one major thing is this fear of being criticized publicly.

An appeal for help from a Catholic teacher,LanguageGeek95,1621621431,"Right, so I am a young teacher in the UK, and I am getting rather worried about how things are looking at the moment. So, back in January, I was meant to teach my class about 'different families', *id est*, 'families' with two dads or two mums; however, as a devout Catholic, I did not teach that trash. Next month, they want me to scandalise my class with graphic filth to rob them of their innocence, but I have already promised God that that is not going to happen. For some strange reason, when something happens in the U.S., the U.K. is not that far behind. After the whole B.L.M. thing last year, loads of people got woke, so they said that our school has to become 'anti-racist'. I never liked B.L.M., but I thought: 'okay, I am against racism, so I can get behind that', and I even put my name forward to represent our school in developing the curriculum to make it more representative of our cohort (I am seriously hoping that I will not be chosen because they will inevitably want to damn U.K. history of which I am very proud and also in light of what I am about to say next). I, in my chronic naïveté, did not realise that this would be used as a Trojan horse to promote teaching children about *diversity on all levels*, which obviously means LGBT and, especially, trans issues. I also did not fully appreciate that anti-racism is actually a movement which finds its origin in Marxism. So, the big question is, what should I do?",Catholicism

Growing up, I was the strongest with my Catholic faith, I always attended youth retreats and never missed Mass. Unfortunately, I too eventually fell away close to 10 years ago (college and military). COVID has been one of the biggest blessings for my family and I (wife and 2 kids). Fortunately, COVID allowed me to take a look at my life choices and realize l needed to return to church. So, last July I realized I needed to go to confession, started going to mass (almost daily) and my entire circle of friends changed. My parents had thought I lost my mind, at first. This morning, my mom asked me about going to confession! She hasn’t gone yet, it’s tomorrow. I know she told me it’s been something like 15 years since she’s received the Eucharist. So, I’m asking for prayers for my family as they continue to journey back closer to our Lord. Thanks everyone! God Bless",Catholicism

Authenticity of Divine Command Theory,Chanduell2019,1621617414,"Hello all! My name is Chandler and I've been researching DCT and Euthyphro's Dilemma for a little bit. This being said, I have a question for all of you regarding DCT and it's authenticity.

Do note, I am new to all of this, so if you do respond (which is appreciated) try and avoid bringing up other topics, and if you must, try explaining them.

So, in Euthyphro's Dilemma, the 2nd Horn seems most appealing to those who follow Judeo-Christian religions, since it shows that God dictates what is Good and what is Bad. Otherwise, morality presupposes God himself, and that ultimately sort of defeats the purpose of God being God (if I'm not mistaken). Therefore, the issue arises that, God commanding things in the Bible is the only way to know what is Good and what is Bad. Many critiques of DCT state that, oh well God commands murder as bad, therefore that makes it morally wrong. Yet, God later smites/kills individuals in the Bible, therefore he is a hypocrite. People also say, DCT clears up the problem of *evil*, meaning anything God wanted was Good, and anything he didn't, was Bad.

My statements and questions on this matter are as follows;

Doesn't God presuppose morals, meaning he can dictate what is good and what is bad, but when he acts, his actions are always good, or neither good or bad? This makes sense since it avoids people saying, well God is a hypocrite and does wrong things like killing people. Yes, but it wasn't wrong because it's God... Second, what's the issue with saying that anything God wanted was Good, and anything he didn't was Bad? This leads to scriptural morality, but I don't see the problem with this. In my opinion, I see nothing wrong with the 2nd Horn of the dilemma, but that's why I am asking all of you. Are there any issues with the 2nd Horn/Response to the dilemma?

Thanks!",Catholicism

I am curious about your thoughts. Do you feel that formal menswear is on the decline? Do less professions require it now than say 10 years ago? Did COVID strike a critical blow to formal wear? 

If you agree with him, do you feel it is a good/bad/neutral thing that formal wear is on the decline?

Some questions about heaven,Buddha4primeminister,1621585064," Hello everyone. I last studied the word of God as a teenager before I went into the Buddhist tradition. However I realize that my study was that of a child and think it is worthwhile to try and grasp it as an adult with more experience with spirituality. I have some questions that I hope some of you would be kind enough to answer. I know this is difficult topic, any attempt to answer would be greatly appreciated.

The new heaven and new earth that you/we will experience in the afterlife is eternal, what does that mean? Will all things become permanent or is it just our souls that will live forever in a still transient world? If so, how is this different form the current earth?

Will there be any room for spiritual growth in the new heaven and new earth, or has spirituality been totally mastered to completion? If this is the case then one has become perfected. How then is one different from God? Or is spiritual growth going to last infinitely in a linear time perspective as God is infinite?

The new heaven and new earth will provide an experience of God that is ever fulfilling and joyous and blissful. This experience is not accessible to us now because of our sinful nature, is this right? I wonder what is the difference between salvation as it pertains to our lives today and the afterlife? If we are not able to rid ourselves from sin here (through Jesus Christ), how can we do it in heaven?

How Do I Have Compassion for Criminals?,DeadpanSpider23,1621561551,"I saw a TikTok today of a criminal defense lawyer celebrating the fact that he and his client won their case despite the fact that the client admitted to him that he was guilty, and it made me so angry. It ruined my day thinking about how some people can escape justice like that and celebrate it.

When I calmed down, I decided to read what criminal defense lawyers have to say about how they can defend criminals, and all they could say was that they want to ensure fair trials and that they have compassion for criminals.

Compassion for criminals? Why should you have compassion for criminals? They’re responsible for their own actions no matter HOW they were brought up. There plenty of people who were brought up wrong but still know right from wrong,” I thought.

Naturally, I grabbed my catechism book, my mind plagued with confirmation bias, and opened up the subject index to crime, punishment, justice, etc. It said that we should be kind to criminals and that we should treat them the same way the criminal defense lawyers do, and I got even angrier.

Why should I? I know since technically I’m a Christian I should believe this but I don’t want to; it has nothing to do with the fact that I can’t, since I know anything is possible through prayer. I simply don’t want to, but I know I have to. I guess I’ll have to pray on it (sort of answered my own question there) but I’m gonna be really hesitant (if I do at all).",Catholicism

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) lost about 30% of its congregation and closed 12.5% of its churches: the United Methodist church lost 16.7% of its congregation and 10.2% of its churches. The Presbyterian Church has had the sharpest decline in church membership: between 2000 and 2015 they lost over 40% of their congregation and 15.4% of their churches.

A question on praying to Saints and intercession,Nyt_Ryda,1621544356,"Hi everyone. So just some background before my question - I was raised as a Baptist, found myself becoming non-denominational. Now after a time of deep prayer and looking at the traditions of the early church, I am now leaning towards Roman Catholicism.

&amp;#x200B;

I will hopefully be attending my first Mass very soon as an inquirer and observer, admiring everything that takes place and speaking with a deacon or possibly the Father of the parish afterwards or when it is appropriate.

But perhaps those here can offer some guidance or ideas for me to consider. There are a few topics that I am struggling with (I will post each in a different post to streamline things to deal with one idea at a time).

&amp;#x200B;

So onto my question for this post, I am having some difficulty understanding the intricacies of praying to Saints. I believe that the Saints are alive in the body of believers (Mark 12:27 and Luke 20:28) and that they offer up their own prayers and the prayers of others (“and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God.” Rev 8:4) and that it is good to make intercessions for all (1 Timothy 2:1).

I also greatly appreciate the prayers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of God, such as the Ave Maria.

&amp;#x200B;

However, some prayers just seem to cross the line from “asking for prayer and intercession from God” which is good, over to asking the saint directly “save us/deliver us/help me” which seems to be things we should be asking for intercession for, so that these things are obtained from God and not directly from the saint.  

Like the extracts from certain prayers below for example. A lot of the prayer is good with intercession requests, etc., but some lines just seem “wrong”? I hope I articulate this correctly, but they seem to seek things from the saints directly, instead of seeking intercession from them who in turn pray to God for these requests

Like here, where some lines do not refer to intercession: 

“From the snares of the devil, St. Anthony deliver us.  
From thunder, lightning and storms, St. Anthony deliver us.  
From all evil of body and soul, St. Anthony deliver us.  
Throughout the course of life, St. Anthony protect us.” 

Or here with the same occurrence: ""To thee do I hasten, O blessed Saint Anthony! Help me in my present affliction. I recommend what I have lost to thy care, in the secure hope that thou wilt restore it to me if it be to the greater glory of God and to the spiritual benefit of my soul.”

And here again, with some lines being something quite huge – directly asking St. Joseph to always be your father and protector:

“O dearest St. Joseph, I consecrate myself to thy honor and give myself to thee, that thou mayest always be my father, my protector and my guide in the way of salvation.”

So my question would be, is this be considered acceptable prayer - with some lines istead of being the usual ""asking for the saints prayer and intercession from God"", and instead forgoing the mentioning of intercession and seeking something like “save us/deliver us/help me” directly?  


And another question, would it be possible for a Catholic with doubts about certain lines in these prayers to rather choose different versions of their prayers, but still be able to consider themselves a Catholic?

&amp;#x200B;

A question on confessing sins and obtaining forgiveness,Nyt_Ryda,1621543937,"Hi everyone. So just some background before my question - I was raised as a Baptist, found myself becoming non-denominational. Now after a time of deep prayer and looking at the traditions of the early church, I am now leaning towards Roman Catholicism.

&amp;#x200B;

I will hopefully be attending my first Mass very soon as an inquirer and observer, admiring everything that takes place and speaking with a deacon or possibly the Father of the parish afterwards or when it is appropriate.

But perhaps those here can offer some guidance or ideas for me to consider. There are a few topics that I am struggling with (I will post each in a different post to streamline things to deal with one idea at a time).

&amp;#x200B;

So onto my question for this post, my understanding is that the Roman Catholic Catechism teaches that a person can have their sins forgiven through prayer (such as an Act of Contrition), but only if they desire to go to Confession at the earliest possible time.

If my understanding is correct, if someone views confession as good and something through which the Lord forgives sins (James 5:15-16 and Matthew 16:19), but not as something absolutely necessary for obtaining forgiveness i.e. That one can confess their sins directly to God and receive forgiveness ( “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness” 1 John 1:9) then that person is actually not forgiven at all ? And following on from this, does this mean that a person such as a Protestant who confesses their sins to God in prayer, will not receive any forgiveness for their sins?

Thank you for any advice or guidance.

"A question on good works, faith and being saved",Nyt_Ryda,1621543777,"Hi everyone. So just some background before my question - I was raised as a Baptist, found myself becoming non-denominational.

&amp;#x200B;

So onto my question for this post, according to my understanding, the below canon from the Council of Trent stands till this day, “If any one saith, that the justice received is not preserved and also increased before God through good works; but that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of Justification obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof; let him be anathema.”

If my understanding is correct, anyone who believes that his good works that others see are BOTH a fruit of his acceptance of Jesus as Lord and savior (“So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit.” Matthew 7:17) as well as something that completes his faith (“You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by works” James 2:22) is actually anathema and because there is no salvation outside of the Roman Catholic church except in cases of ignorance, this person is now condemned by God? 

&amp;#x200B;

Given the Council of Trent stance that good works causes an increase of the justice received, at what point does one receive enough justice from good works to be considered saved? 

We know that it is possible for one to know that they will be awarded by the Lord on that Day after keeping the faith (“I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.” 2 Timothy 4:7-8) so how do we tell when someone has finished their race?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any advice or guidance, because as a person who has heard many times about Catholics teaching a “works based” salvation, I am struggling to understand the finer aspects of this topic.

So onto my question for this post, according to my understanding, there is no salvation outside the Roman Catholic church except in circumstances of ignorance – when a person is not aware of the Roman Catholic church, or the person is unaware that it is the church founded by Christ in Matthew 16:18, etc.

If my above understanding is correct, my question is this - How does one come to terms with this, which seems like a very harsh teaching? Let’s relate this to a certain Protestant for example. This person knows of the Roman Catholic church which has apostolic succession from Peter till today, but views the church rather as the body of all believers of the triune God as described in the creeds and decisions of the first seven ecumenical councils, across all the various denominations. 

The fact that this Protestant who believes in the triune God, acknowledges they are a sinner who needs saving, declares with their mouth that Jesus is Lord and believes in their heart that God raised him from the dead, conforms to the Apostles Creed, Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed, who accepts Jesus as their savior and who was baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, will still be condemned by God because of their broader more ecumenical view of what the universal/catholic church is ?

Also; the aliens as people claim to have encountered them don’t really make sense.

They’ve been light years ahead of us technologically since about 1950. In all that time they never once tried to invade/ conquer/ wipe us out and instead beamed people into their space ships or ruined farmers Cornfields in Wyoming/ Montana.

Conditions for life existing anywhere but in our solar system seem extremely remote.

Lastly, the UFO community seems so uninspiring. Rarely do the people involved in it exude hope, joy or peace. Whenever I’ve looked into the matter I’ve been depressed and worried about what could be. My thoughts aren’t really centers in God or anything close.

Ambigious feelings towards being happy I'm Catholic,MrBoemmel,1621532530,"Hey Brothers and Sisters,blessings and love to you all! 
Apologies for the long read but here we go:

Lately the following has been nagging my mind as a recent comeback to The Faith:  We are all hopefully trying our best to live as much as good followers of Christ as we are capable of. This implies to be ethically/ morally able to distinguish between good and evil in our lives,based on what our Lord has revealed to us and through the truthfull Shepherds of His Message.
Now, it would come to me,and I presume all of us at some point,when we encounter grave sin or even true evil, that we are glad not to be part of it or at least trying not to be part of it. 

Yet at the same time I worry that those feelings and thoughts are seeping over into pride and vanity which obviously would make me immediatly sinning again. So I need to be carefull not to take pride in these things too much but at the same time also to be able to be happy about the Lord guiding me on the right way.

It feels like balancing on a very small rope and I wanted just to enquire if this is something some of you have encountered and how've you've handled it? I suppose there are probably some works by saints or church doctors that handled this topic,which I would appreciate if someone would point me to.

If you are attempting to assassinate a person about to do major harm but they always have innocent people right next to them is there any situation where you can intentionally kill the innocent.  Does this change if the target is a military position/warehouse but it is placed so it can not be attacked with civilian casualties.

Hi All, I work with a non-religious lapsed Catholic and I was speaking with him the other day who said that if abortion became illegal the Church needed to be more welcoming to contraception.

How can/should I correct without further driving a wedge between individuals and the Church in the future?

Does this article about God's love have any merit? Is it full of pain?,Original_Hat730,1621525371,"In the article a writers discussing how God hurts his followers (not the wicked however) in order to get us to realize we are his children.

He Scourges Those He Loves

God’s love does not orbit around our felt needs. He has our best, not our easiest, in mind. His love — dangerous, jealous, possessive — is the love that will consistently wound us to save us.

Have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? “My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.”

Hebrews 12:5–6

“Chastises” here can be translated “scourges” or “whips.” It is something to endure. Something unpleasant and rather painful. Something we wouldn’t sign up for. Something we’re tempted to despise. Something that doesn’t feel tender, gentle, or loving in the moment. But his whippings are just that. Look at the text.

He strikes those he loves and harms every son whom he receives. He doesn’t discipline Satan’s children, only his own (

Hebrews 12:8

These undesirable corrections, these marks of adoption, bring us to “share his holiness” and enjoy that “peaceful fruit of righteousness” leading to eternal life

Hebrews 12:10–11

His love has sharp edges — not to destroy us, but to sever us from all that threatens to. Instead of what we often perceive to be the stormings of our angry God, proof of his disgust with us, these corrections are, in fact, the unlikely evidences of his love. As Calvin put it,

It is an inestimable consolation — that the punishments by which our sins are chastened are evidences, not of God’s anger for our destruction, but rather of his paternal love, and are at the same time of assistance towards our salvation, for God is angry with us as his sons, whom he will not leave to perish.

He will not leave us to perish. When we wander toward cliffs, he corrals us with his rod back toward heaven. What feels to be the glory of the “god of love” — being left to our own way — is, in reality, his wrath, which bears the refrain: “God gave them up . . . gave them up . . . gave them up” (

Romans 1:24

Even Death Can Be Love.

That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. . . . But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. (

1 Corinthians 11:30

God’s love does not sit by quietly, contentedly, while we wander off into destruction. It does not stand by and watch his bride play the whore. It finds us. Redeems us. Washes us. Transforms us. Disciplines us. And sometimes it kills us.

TLDR; this is an article saying basically God hurts you out of his love

A confused Catholic teenager who needs guidance,MysteriousRow1365,1621523381,"Good day, I'm an incoming college freshman and I really really need guidance or an advice probably from a priest or any religious person. If you happen to see this please pray for me as well.

**(kinda long story ahead but if you have the time, pls read.)** 

I've been praying for months now about my college applications and I've been asking signs from God. I applied to 5 universities, now going 6. I passed 3 of them and failed 1. How do you actually know if God tells you that something is meant for you and it is according to his will?

For my first choice of school, the results came last April. I felt really confident that I'll pass and I feel like I'm really meant for that university since they have a high passing rate and I felt like my credentials were fine for them. I felt like that's where God leads me since I was in middle school, but sadly, I failed. I was really devastated and I'm still sad about it until now. I instantly appealed for reconsideration after getting rejected and still continue to hope for a chance but the competition for my desired course is so tough and there is no assurance that there will be slots left for those who didn't meet the cut-off scores. They don't have a certain date to tell us either if we get reconsidered or not. I'm wondering if it isn't really God's will for me to study there no matter how much I want to attend the university or is it just a test for my faith and determination?  


This May, my second dream university just released the results and I wasn't really expecting anything. First, because it's a very prestigious and selective school and only the brightest students get in. I feel like I'm just an average student and will never get accepted. Second, their tuition fees are really expensive and we can't afford to study there unless there will be a scholarship. Despite of these hindrances that I thought of, I still prayed to God and even asked for a sign that if I pass (esp. in the course I want) and get a scholarship, this is now where He leads me. May 17, around 8 AM, I opened my email and to my surprise, I passed just like what I asked for. However I wasn't granted a scholarship and it's not the course I want since it's not medical/science related. It made me more confused than ever for my college studies after that happened. I passed but it's possible that I cannot enroll due to the univ's very expensive tuition fees and a small chance of getting reconsidered for financial assistance since I got rejected for that part. In addition to that, it definitely matches my original prayer before the universities started releasing results, which is for God to lead me to whatever school that will be good for my overall health (this particular Catholic univ in our country is known to be very kind, compassionate, and caring for their students esp. this pandemic), and to a school where I know that I can grow and develop my other skills to be a better person and a leader for the community. (This univ is also known for having holistic education due to their core curriculum).

 Is it still the school for me since the results was something unexpected and He answered my prayers this time? (although it is not exactly what I asked since again, I do not have the scholarship) And is God just testing my faith again, telling me to work for that scholarship appeal first and not lose my faith because that certain univ may be really for me? Or I'm not for this school either and I'm just desperately looking for signs.  


Another scenario, I passed two of my ""back-up"" univs. However, I didn't immediately enroll because I didn't really prefer those schools that much and my parents don't want to risk paying an expensive reservation fee if I'm still unsure and is still waiting for my reconsideration appeals. Now one of them is slowly running out of slots and idk what to do. I want to risk paying fees already since I don't want to lose my chance if in case that those two aforementioned schools will reject my appeals. However, there's still something that I cannot shake off of me. Telling me that I should still wait a little longer(?)

Now the results of other two universities I applied for will both be released on July. Making me more confused if those two will exactly be the answer to my prayers. I don't even know if asking for signs from God is right anymore.

Thank you so much for reading and I hope that you could help me from my worries and help me to have a clearer mind to be able to decide. I also apologize if it's kind of confusing for some but I hope you understood what I'm trying to tell. :)) Stay safe and healthy everyone and God bless all of you!",Catholicism

My conversion to catholicism,theotokosprayforus,1621519572,"I was a lapsed protestants for years -- when I first started dating my now husband, to when we got married. I didn't take religion seriously, and I even called myself a radical marxist feminist. 

One night I had a vision of Christ that just completely changed my world. I was 100% sober by the way, but I was very depressed, anxious, and suicidal and suffered from PTSD. Just like that, I was a new creation in Christ, and I completely surrendered my life to Him. The Lord rescued me from hell. 

I felt compelled to research the catholic church, which I know came from the Holy Spirit because I had 0 exposure to catholicism (never went to mass, went to public school my whole life, no catholic friends,   no catholic had ever explained their faith to me, etc.). 

My husband was very confused and even upset with my conversion experience. It caused a lot of fights and disagreements in our marriage over the next few months, but I didn't stop investigating the catholic church. I quickly fell in love with the faith, with the church, with catholic philosophy, with Our Blessed Mother (how can protestants have just completely discarded the Mother of God????), and with the beautiful saints of the church. 

I cried so much to the Lord over those past months, asking Him to heal my marriage and open my husband's eyes to stop being so hostile to my new faith, and to stop being so hostile to Him. Well the Lord told me to just love my husband, be patient, be humble, and meet my husband where he is at. You bet I also cried to St Monica! 

Well I am so happy to say that my husband and I are getting our marriage convalidated in the catholic church! He is a baptized catholic, but not practicing. Yet he told me that he sees how much joy and healing my new faith has given me, he sees how I am no longer suicidal and depressed, how I have less anxiety and panic attacks. He said that he sees how I don't hate myself and the world, like I used to. He apologized with how hostile he was in the beginning, and now he said that he supports me and my faith journey completely.

Should we make ourselves suffer?,Consistent_Payment_1,1621518981,"I read of many Saints who purposefully inflicted pain on themselves.

"Is there a priest who I can talk to? I'm in a dark place right now. I got dumped last week, now my cat has less than 50% chance to live. I need spiritual guidance.

I know it seems so shallow, a lot of people are also suffering, dying, and experiencing worse problems right now.

But I know I should reach out to people. Since I can't handle this alone.

Last week this girl I was seeing for 3 months dumped me. I didn't know what I did wrong. I was in a deep depression, now exactly 8 days after being dumped, I receive a message from my mother that my cat, that I love and had for almost 4 years, was not eating. I immediately went home to my parents and saw that my cat was so thin. It looked liked it hadn't been fed for a week, but my mother said they were always feeding her, and that just Tuesday she started not eating. I rushed her to the vet, and the vet told me she may have had a virus after a blood count. She was so weak, I broke down and cried at home. The vet said she has less than 50 percent chance to survive.

I love that cat, I treat her like family, and what's worse is it happened during COVID, just after getting dumped, and just a few days after I resigned from my job.

It feels like a lot of bad things are happening to me lately. I  feel so stressed out, anxious, and depressed. I don't want to lose my faith, but why did this happen?

My last confession was 2 or 3 years ago. But I recently confessed my sins to God spiritually. I was avoiding physical mass since my mother, brother, and I are asthmatic, so I'm trying to avoid physical gathering out of fear of COVID. But we do regularly attend online mass.

Please pray for my cat, her name is Arya.",Catholicism

Non-Catholic Attending Mass,princessp15,1621513101,"I am in the early stages of looking into joining my local Catholic Church. I have attended mass before, but not with the intentions of eventually joining. I now have a new perspective. Would someone be able to tell me the proper way to attend a mass as a non-Catholic? I know I am not supposed to take communion, so I am basically looking for things like that with this post. A couple other things I can think of with my limited experience:

1. Everyone kneels before sitting in the pew. I assume they use this time for prayer, but I haven't been in a while, so I really don't remember. Do I kneel when they do, or do I sit down? I don't want to be awkward or seem out of place either way. 
2. Everyone recites certain prayers. I know Our Father, but other than that, I don't know the others. What others do they chant? I have read over and prayed these several times in the last few weeks, but I don't have them memorized yet. Should I memorize them prior to attending mass.

What else should I know or expect before I go? Also, I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I teach a Sunday school class at my church on Sundays, so I will be attending an early mass at my local Catholic Church and then head to my own church due to my obligations there.

Glad to say I am back on the path of being a devout Catholic once again. Anyway I tell her that the Catholic church is the one true church started by Christ. She'll go on to say no it was Peter but I remember the verse from Matthew 16:18. Next she dislike how we worship Mary which is something we don't do. Like most protestants they believe Mary was never holy, not a virgin and had other kids and died. Yes it is blasphemous, many times I had told her. She will go on and say the protestant religion was started because the Catholic church had to be reformed but still ignoring the fact that you can't just go ahead and start your own church. I pray he rosary everyday and she believes it is wrong. I told her that the rosary was given to St. Dominic from an apparition of Mary but once again she'll say no Mary died therefore it did  not happen. When I brought up Saints she was saying you can't do that and that's the problem with Catholics, only the bible matters. I explain that the saints do matter because of their teachings and actions etc. Praying the Hail Mary is wrong and so on.

If i were an atheist, this would be my biggest problem with christianity for sure. I think a lot of christians don' t understand what this view of salvation implies. More than 5 bilion people who are alive atm will suffer for etetnity, most of them didnt choose their religion bit they were born on different culture or country. What about those who have never heard the gospel, what about other religions, what about people before Jesus,what about atheists who didnt have enough informationma, many pf them didnt reject christian faith but some fundamentalist interpretation of it? Will they all go to hell for eternity? ETERNITY, forever, suffering for eternity, becauss they didnt have enough information. Ask yourself for a moment, if this is true, is God  really just and equivalent for love? In my mind exclusivism seems really really implausible. What about inclusivism or even universalism? Romans 2 teaches(if i understand correctly) that people who didnt have enough information wont be judged by the law but by the information they had. That seems plausible to me, and more in align with God's nature. Also Jesus himself in Matthew 25 31-46 talks about how salvation can be achieved even if you ""didnt know Jesus"" during your earthly life"". Maybe nonchristians can be in a relationship with God when they act like Jesus. That's why Jesus said if you helped my brothers, you helped me, if you fed them, you fed me. Maybe you can be in a relationship with Jesus even if you are not aware of that, like a relationship and conection beetween mother and a baby in mother's womb. Also what about atheists, can they achieve salvation by God's grace.

So far he's discussed the superfluous smells and bells, how the church forgot how the mass went in the early church because they added so much stuff after constantine, how the church only taught Jesus as a demanding judge so everyone was afraid to receive communion, how nobody could participate because the priest faced away and whispered, and how the communion rail made receiving the precious blood difficult, so the church invented the doctrine that supported receiving under one substance.

The moment we disable the human pawns enoigh to make them useless to Hell, their own Masters finish the work for us. They break their tools."" (C. S. Lewis, That Hideous Strength) 

In these trying times where being a Christain is viewed as something backwards, silly, even ""hateful"", we must remember who our true Master is and how much they hated Him. We must remember what He calls us to do and live the creed He commands of us, so that we can be brought closer to the Father. We must garner strength from the faith His Mother had before He was conceived and the grit she had when He was executed. She stood beside His youngest follower, the desciple whom He loved, who was the only one man enough to behold his new mother on top of that skull rock.

Those that worship themselves idolize devils. Those that worship demons idolize themselves. They live in circular logic where love is rendered meaningless because they define it within itself. God is love. They sacrafice children and their fellow man on the altar of radicalism and materialistic ethics. Pray for them so that they may never know the prehistoric horrors that exist in the shadowed corners of Lucifer's house. For they do not know that the enemy of their enemy is also their foe.

Being that these babies would understandably be at risk for things related to their prematurity (typical with multiple births) such as developmental delays, various health issues and such, the parents and any extended family who are in the picture have a lot to deal with. And, while the chances of having another set of nonuplets is highly unlikely-- the chances of having another multiple birth are somewhat higher than for a woman who has only a single baby, or even twins considering that these nonuplets happened without the use of IVF. This puts the family in a dilemma.

Obviously, the mother and father allowed the pregnancy to progress without ending any of the babies' lives, and God brought them and the mother all through safely. Normally, when there is such a large pregnancy, the decision is made for the safety of the babies and the mother, to ""thin the herd"" through selective abortion which of course contradicts Catholic teaching and values. But God kept them safe. However... considering the heightened chance that this mother could experience another multiple birth, possibly a higher-order multiple (triplets or above), and considering the extreme physical stress to her body already created by the nonuplet pregnancy, another pregnancy could really be hard on her and the next baby/babies. Never mind the huge financial strain already brought on with an ""instant baseball team""; more children and especially more children who would need extra TLC which sadly, isn't free, there poses a challenge that is virtually unfathomable.

Under these circumstances, there really may be a case for the couple to not risk another pregnancy, at least n the short and mid-term until it's known whether these nonuplets will need additional life-long care, or what the situation will be. Other than using NFP (Natural Family Planning, which is permitted by the Catholic Church), would there be any kind of dispensation available to this couple to use another form of birth control to be very sure that another multiple pregnancy or dangerous situation doesn't occur for this couple? Obviously, they could choose adoption for a single or set of twins, but if she ends up again with high-order multiples... even adoption could be less likely.

Of course, abortion is a HARD NO. NFP is an option, but not foolproof. My beloved son is proof of that! But what about the ""least damaging"" form of birth control, such as condoms, or condom + diaphragm, or condom + diaphragm + spermicides? We aren't even bringing the Pill, or IUD's, or implanted birth control such as Norplant or similar things.

Would this couple be allowed a ***TEMPORARY dispensation*** to use any kind of ""barrier"" and reversible birth control short of abstinence from intercourse (not abstinence from all marital intimacy), or NFP? 

This is a moral dilemma, and deals with an extreme but very real case. What's the scoop?",Catholicism

Two interesting and controversial photographs taken inside Malta's main cathedral.,zogins,1621463671,"The first photo shows a solid silver gate that protects the blessed sacrament in one of the side chapels. When Napoleon raided Malta in 1798 he started stealing from churches to finance his war efforts. Some Maltese individuals quickly painted this silver gate with black paint so that it would look like iron. It was saved and we still have it.

The second picture shows the golden bust of a Knight of Malta but beneath him, kneeling, is an Ottoman Muslim and a black man. Definitely not PC by today's standard but it must be remembered that this cathedral was built after the great siege of 1565 that saw Muslims trying to capture Catholic Malta; and failing.

How Do I Have Fruitful Friendships/Family Relationships with Protestants by Responding to These Situations Correctly?,HairyWhiteKid,1621454021,"Okay I'm going to try to explain and ask this as best as possible.

I am a convert from protestantism, so many of my close friends and family members are protestant, though now I have a lot of solid Catholics I'm close to.

Though I will always affirm and defend the fact that the Catholic Church is the One True Church, and the fact that that knowingly and willingly rejecting any part of the Catholic faith is a mortal sin, thus one who does so cannot be saved, I understand this doesn't have to be said in every conversation with non-Catholics, as prudence would dictate.

However, I often run into the following scenarios very often, and I am at a loss for how to handle them with proper charity and truth and without cowardice or indifferentism:

1. Friend, family member, or acquaintance will say something to the effect of, ""Well, although we may disagree on a lot of things, all that really matters is that we believe in Jesus as the Savior.""
2. Friend, family member, or acquaintance will say something to the effect of, ""Yeah I'm getting more involved in my \[protestant\] church"" or ""I've really been growing a lot from this \[interdenominational\] Bible study I've been going to!""
3. Friends of mine have recently gotten hired for jobs in protestant ministry (Young Life, Campus Crusade for Christ, etc. are various protestant ministries), and I don't know if I should congratulate them at all, or if I do congratulate them, how I would even do so.

What do I do/say in these situations? No part of me wants to be uncharitable or drive people away, but at the same time, there comes a point where the faith needs to be defended, lest someone thinks I am promoting Religious/Christian Indifferentism, which is a grave sin of scandal.

Usually when I have asked people about this, I've heard things to the effect of, ""It really just depends on the situation and relationship you have with them. Just trust in the Holy Spirit."" Obviously, I agree with this and have trust in the Lord. But at the same time, there has to be at least a few general proper responses to these situations, and it is better to be prepared than not prepared.

On the one hand, I can see how responding ""That's great man, I'm proud of you!"", to either #2 or #3 could be interpreted by a protestant as me wholesale endorsing their beliefs, which is to be avoided. But on the other hand, maybe I am not actually causing as much scandal as I'd think, or any scandal at all when I say something like that.

I guess an overarching question could be, where's the line between building a bridge in hopes of future conversion and implicitly denying or failing to uphold what the Church teaches to be objectively true due to cowardice?

The power of the St Michael prayer,El-YeeYee,1621453374,"Hey everyone. I wanted to share with yall a story of how powerful the St Michael prayer really is, to help remember that it is a great tool against demons, and to remind everyone that demons are real, but can't do anything against the power of Jesus. 
When I was in college, I took a trip with FOCUS (Fellowship of Catholic University Students) to the mountains for a retreat. One of the events was all night adoration, with us students taking shifts to make sure Jesus was never alone. My shift was from 2am to 3am. I had a really great prayer session, in fact my faith was at one of its strongest points of my life during this time. Afterward I went back to the sleeping area, and layed face down in the bunk. I was just feeling great, basking in the knowledge of how much God loves me. Then, I hear a voice growl in my ear ""you know God isn't even real, right?"". For some reason I responded and whispered ""of course He is real, I was just in His presence in adoration."" Suddenly my body goes paralyzed, I can't move, like a sleep paralysis situation, and worse, I feel a pair of massive hands pressing down hard on my back. I try to scream, but I don't know if it's working or not because of the paralyzed feeling. After some seconds, it stops. The next morning, one of the guys that was in the room complained that he didn't get much sleep because I decided to scream in the middle of the night for no reason. However, my roommate at the time pulled me aside, and he let me know that as soon as he heard me screaming, he started praying the St Michael prayer in his head. He said shortly after that, my screaming stopped. I truly think that he saved me that day with his quick response of the prayer. Please always remember that prayer is powerful, and a powerful tool against the demons in this world. Does anyone else have any experiences like this?",Catholicism

Honestly Trying to Figure Out the Truth on Vatican II and Extraordinary Form of the Mass,HairyWhiteKid,1621452198," 

Hey there y'all,

Though I definitely consider myself a traditionalist, I do not want to be wed to an ideology over the objective truth. But when trying to figure out the validity of the claims made about Vatican II by my Archbishop L\*f\*bvr\* praising, ultra-trad close friend, I am at a loss on what to make of things (for reference, he is not schismatic, and he recognizes the current Pope as the true successor of Peter).

There are many claims that he has made to me, and every time I probe him on these claims, he seems to give answers that make perfect sense to me (with a great amount of charity rather than arrogance), but I just want to make sure I'm not getting sucked down a rabbit hole.

The main things I've heard him claim are:

1. Though still 100% a valid council, there are 3 main errors in Vatican II: collegiality, religious liberty, and ecumenism.
2. V2 was overall a pastoral council and not a dogmatic one. The parts that are infallible are where it reaffirms past dogmas of councils. It didn't claim any new dogmas, therefore (if I'm understanding correctly), not every single word or paragraph of the council is infallible.
3. Because the council was not considered infallible wholesale (every word or every paragraph), it is possible that there are errors, and where these errors lie, we can reject them because they go against past councils, teachings for Church Doctors/Saints, etc. Otherwise, we must submit with full intellect and will to dogmatic statements/reaffirmations.

I've also heard from others that the Extraordinary Form of the mass is more efficacious than the Ordinary Form because it is in Latin, the sacred language of the Universal Church, and because the prayers themselves are more reverent and sacrificially worded (as opposed to a ""Lord's Supper"" interpretation that Protestants often have around their ""communion"", which is more present in the OF rubrics than the EF). So in short, the better things you pray about and for, and the more sacred the language, the greater the potential graces insofar as each individual is disposed to receive them.

What are y'alls thoughts about these ideas?

I really want to know the truth, so any sources you can point me to would be excellent!",Catholicism

Catholic Work Ethic? How Much Should We Work?,pursuingholiness,1621446564,"Last night, I finished work for the day, but felt guilty about not getting that much done. I came across a YouTube video that was a sermon by St. Alphonsus on the value of time. He was saying how people waste their time playing and being social, instead of gaining heavenly rewards; and that we will be judged for our idleness just as we will be judged for all our idle words.

I started feeling nervous about all of this and wondered if I was wasting my time by not spending the rest of my night working. I told myself I would make up the time in the morning after prayer, but I haven't been able to decide how long I should work.

I watched some YouTube videos to get an idea of what's an appropriate amount of work, but I couldn't decide. Some people complained that 40 hour work weeks are bad for productivity, there were mixed reviews on Tim Ferriss's 4-hour work week (some praising it, but others harshly criticizing it). Jordan Peterson said he works 100-hours a week (morning til night) and has done so everyday since 1985, other people talked about working 10 hours a day, 14 hours a day, or 16 hours a day.

I'm also having some trouble discerning good uses of time vs bad uses. I scrolled through this subreddit last night and watched YouTube videos related to the faith, but I worried that this was all a waste of time. I also thought it was wasting time when I started reading chapters of Sirach. I felt that it would have been a better use of my time to keep working, but I felt like I mentally couldn't go on with it (my work revolves around studying the word of God, btw. Also I'm self-employed).

I was wondering if there's some kind of guide on how much we should work as Catholics. I know laziness and sleep are heavily condemned in Scriptures (especially Proverbs) and work is spoken highly of. I want to make sure I'm glorifying God with my time and not squandering it.

**TL;DR: How long should we work if we are self-employed, and what is considered wasting time?**

Why is it (almost) exclusively Christian countries that have given into modern “progressivism”,Caramal76,1621441272,"Just as an example of what I mean:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage

29 countries in the world have legalized gay marriage. 28 of those countries are Christian countries (both historically and with the largest current religion being Christianity. Most are majority Christian by a large margin). The only other is Taiwan. There is not a single Muslim country on there, nor Hindu, nor even any nations like China, North Korea, Cuba, etc. with state atheism. It’s literally all Christian countries.

I bring this up because I was in a discussion with a friend recently about how the world is going crazy with LGBT ideology, BLM/ Critical Race Theory type racialist ideas, and just general gender/sexual insanity everywhere. I had brought up that this gives a very pragmatic reason to be Catholic as the Church is steady and unchanging and will oppose these ideologies forever. He said that I’m not totally wrong, but I got the religion wrong. Christianity failed in protecting traditional values. He says Islam is the religion that protects true conservatism and traditional roles relating to gender, sex, family, etc.

He categorically said ""to me it doesn't matter (what they do/say/believe) as long as they believe in Christ"" and he put a nice lid on the conversation, no more input there.

This happened a little before this all mess in Germany, but because it still bothers me and to join in the fun I'd like to know what you think. 

I'm mad because i don't think this should be a proper answer for a bishop of all people to give. You're in charge of the people in the diocese, you're meant to shepherd, to lead, to teach. It should matter to you that the catholics under you under the faith and live it properly.

How can you teach Catholicism if the Nicene Creed DOESN'T MATTER?

Is faith is Christ alone enough for you, whose job it is to care apostolically? What if they want fo convert? Is RCIA a necessary evil or an actual tool of learning?

In praise of the Swiss Guard,TJB74,1621414122,"In 1503, the need to protect the Pope was pressing in a time of shifting alliances and local wars. Italy  was a collection of often feuding states, including the papal states. There was no clear distinction between spiritual power and temporal power. 

In September 1505, the first contingent of 150 soldiers started their march towards Rome. Famous for their colourful uniforms of blue, red, orange and yellow with a distinctly Renaissance appearance. It is a widely held myth that they were designed by Michelangelo, they were in fact introduced by commandant Jules Repond in 1914. 

Since the failed assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981, enhanced training in unarmed combat and small arms is now prioritised. Recruits must have completed basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces. They work closely with the Vatican’s police or security force, Gendarmerie Corps of Vatican City State.

I still don't see the church as a bad thing, but really positively.

I see so many issues in my life as just ""oh yeah, that's God's work it'll be fine"" but no, I refuse to believe that God is inspiring my mother to say things like, ""I own you, if I wanted to beat you It would be fine and you would still have to respect me"" after I told her to not touch me after she pushed me in my chair when she found u was still awake late at night. I'm definitely not a good child, but everytime she notices something bad that she does, she doesn't apologize, she tells me ""God has given me the awful task of being your mother for a reason"" which I just don't see the issue in recognizing something bad that you did. I have never been physically abused, in my eyes, the occasional spanking, or backhand is necessary and I'm very grateful that I haven't been abused like that, but emotionally it's almost on a constant basis, I'm not a complete emotional unstable mess, but I'm nothing close to sturdy, (I've cut myself I'm the past, which she doesn't know) and countless times when she gets upset she'll say something like ""Bruce, you're literally going to make me kill myself"" while I'm hard tears and clearly very upset. She doesn't seem to give me any agency whatsoever and I currently do not have a door, because ""I can't be trusted with one"" I know this seems like more of a complaint of my mother, but I see this in my friends parents too, who also have mental issues, she thinks that God is telling her to kill herself, and had to be taken to a psych ward for almost a week away from her family.

I feel lost and worthless.,BeardLikeKolbe,1621409584,"I feel like God doesn't care about me.

Let me clarify: I think God cares a whole lot about whether or not I end up spending eternity with Him, but I have great difficulty believing that God has any interest in what happens to me in the intervening time.

I feel like God loves humanity in the same way that a person loves their body: as a whole. Do you weep for every dead skin cell that sloughs off? Do you trouble yourself over every hair that falls out, or every fingernail clipping? No, you don't.

I have great difficulty believing that I, BeardLikeKolbe, and what I do on this Earth make a lick of difference to the Almighty. That I, as a human being, matter.

On the outside, my life seems okay. I have a good relationship with my family. I'm very active in my parish. I have a few good friends. I have a nice house and a steady (if stressful) job that pays relatively well.

All of it seems empty and meaningless.

God doesn't seem absent, but He seems... very far away. All the time. Praying feels more like tossing a message in a bottle into the ocean than a conversation.

I got to talking with him. Asked him if he could make me a weight plate rack because I had recently started building a home gym and needed to organize the plates. 

Turns out the guys a Baptist. Asking me if I've been Baptized. Said yeah, as a kid. Communion too. He didn't like that answer. Said if I joined him at his church, the weight rack was a gift. Took us like 20 minutes to make. It was weird for me to ask that of him. Weird. Never went to that church. 

Got me thinking on the drive home. A lot to lose if I'm wrong as an atheist. Nothing to gain if I'm right. Haven't been to church forever.

Question: Would Those Who Died After The Time of Christ Go to Heaven Even If They Had No Idea That Christ Existed?,Medical_Current3407,1621401738,"
I say this because at the time of Jesus' death, there were approximately 300 million people walking the Earth and Nazareth only had about like 2,000 - 3,000 people inhabiting it at the time of Jesus' life and death (correct me if I'm wrong of course as I found these numbers on Google after a bit of research)

But anyways, my point is, when Jesus was here, his message was not spread quickly enough to all 300 million people walking the Earth simply because back in the day, word of mouth couldn't spread that fast.

And Christianity believes that in order to get to Heaven, one must accept Christ as his or her Lord and Savior. 

But, if these people who died after the time of Christ, and even many years later considering the Gospels weren't written for awhile, didn't even know Jesus existed, then what would be their fate? Hell since they technically didn't accept Christ as their savior? 

I find this idea interesting because if so, would that really be a just God?

I'm terrified,AllanTheCowboy,1621399883,"I'm terrified the Tribunal will come back and tell me I'm validly married.  I'm terrified I'll be trapped in that nowhere the rest of my life.

I have no kids so it's like my divorce isn't real.  People don't see it the same way.  Don't treat it the same way.  One lawyer I talked to, also Catholic, when I said there were no children he said ""that's a blessing.""  He isn't the only one to have expressed that sentiment.

If didn't count.  It wasn't real.  No children so we weren't a family.  And that's what I think even she thinks.  It's like my marriage was just a glorified long-term-relationship, a make believe adult life or something.

Here I am middle aged and... nothing.  I'm not a peer to my cohort.  I don't belong.  I don't have any of the experiences they have.  I am as isolated now as any time in my life.

In a way it's even  worse if it's null because then it's true.  Then none of it was real.  I've spent over ten years of my life on something fake and now they're gone and the man looking back at me in the mirror is getting grey whiskers and I don't always recognise him.  Sometimes I hate him for what he's done to me.  Sometimes I apologise to him for what I've done to him and where I've left him.

The loss is awful but what's worse is the erasure.  My life wasn't a real thing.  My family wasn't a family.  I hate every day and I drag myself through it for others.

My church doesn't want me.  They don't want my gifts or my efforts.  I have to make an appointment for confession and I haven't been to Mass since I had to quit music because down in the nave there's no respect for COVID protocols and I cahoot afford to go down.  Our priests are awful.  There isn't a decent liturgy for a hundred miles or more.  There's no consolation in church and I'm basically unwanted there because I'm good at stuff.

I'm older than many of the parents  that they want on all the councils and committees etc. but I'm considered in the same category as the 20-somethings in terms of capability and wisdom, but I don't bring the perspective of youth so I have no value.  I don't fit in any of the categories so I'm nobody and nothing.  I don't matter.  I'm a strange outlier and whatever I do must be self serving because if I'm not here for my kids or grandkids I'm just here for me.  Who else is there, right? 

I feel like it's weird if I want to have a relationship or any kind with children in the parish.  If I thought I had something to give or share by being a friend or offering a word of advice or encouragement or whatever.

I don't belong.  And I never will.  I wish I didn't know the truth because then I could just leave.

There's no place for me.  Even in the places for the unwanted and rejected and marginalised I don't belong because I show up on Sunday in a suit with a fresh haircut.

A story about praying the Rosary in Spanish (with prayers and mysteries at the end for those who would like to pray it in this beautiful language also),LanguageGeek95,1621399327,"When I was sixteen, I went to college (what we call the last two grades of American high school in England) to study English Language, English Literature and Religion. There was an old Anglican church on the high street (what we call main street in England) which had recently been refurbished and, to be quite honest, looked rather beautiful. However, given the dire state of the Anglican Communion these days, most of its adherents have either converted to Catholicism, some other Protestant church or fallen into atheism; therefore, the relatively vast space of this church was often empty. I took advantage of this to try and 'Catholicise' it by frequently praying the Rosary there and I often did so in my family's ancestral language: Spanish. 400 years ago, onlookers would have seen this as a criminal act and possibly evidence of spying for Spain. One day, when I was doing this, there was an Irish family, possibly from the North, who came into the church, and a kind old woman from that family saw me praying the Rosary, came up to me, stroked my face and, as I looked up, she smiled at me and blessed me. This was one of the most touching experiences in my life.

But with the people who willingly debase themselves or try to spread this stuff to others (especially children) I'm... disgusted. Beyond disgusted idk.

What prompted me to inquire is that I have a coworker who is a ""man"" that flayed her skin from her arm and reattached it to her genitals, started taking testosterone, and sliced her breasts off. She tries to talk in a deeper voice which is impossible so it winds up being a guttural gargle. She has no sense of boundaries and I reflexively recoil when she brushes into me. I have a hard time speaking to her because if I say ""she"" I will get harshly reprimanded but I'm not willing to lie and say ""he"". When I see their flayed arm I gag.

"Abortion, communion, politicians, and church teaching.",DependentShirt8089,1621387032,"This is not a political post.  Just a multitude of question that involve some aspect of people in politics.

Firstly how likely is the USCCB in banning pro-choice politicians from receiving Jesus?  If so when?

What do you think the secular national reaction would be?  I personally believe that groups like Antifa and or others that “espouse” freedom from “any patriarchy” and/or “feminist” would cause a stir.  I can only imagine a Catholic Bishop (a man) denying some pro-choice politician (a woman) the Eucharist.  They would go after them and call them sexist and all kinds of other stuff.

Lastly would it be right to do this?  I understand the thought that this would cause division, but I also get that (and more importantly) this is Jesus and those who commit mortal sin are not allowed to receive until after reconciliation.  I also tend to agree with the Winston Churchill quote

"Growing up Catholic in America in the 2000’s, a retrospective",starwars92,1621381668,"A bit about myself, I grew up catholic in America in the 2000’s, and when I consider everything I learned *as* a catholic, from attending church, youth ministry, speaking with priests, and there’s some major things that were taught to me that bother me in retrospect and really make me question whether I should go back.

1) Over emphasis on opposition to abortion and to same sex marriage. It’s like the whole litmus test on what was considered politically good or bad was whether or not one/the politician was against those things. Were we told to question the brutal foreign policy of our leaders, the prison industrial complex, or the gross injustice of for profit healthcare? Nope. If George W Bush or John McCain support “traditional families”, forget whether or not they want to carpet bomb the Middle East. 
2) Over emphasis on sexual sin. Are you a teenager that finds yourself masturbating occasionally? Congratulations, you’re committing a grave sin. That on top of teaching people abstinence only sex education is literally setting young people up to have mental health issues from guilt/believing their bodies are evil.

And then extend that to the political spectrum, in countries where AIDS was rampant, Catholics pushed abstinence only education. How many people did and orphans did that leave behind? The church has to play some kind of role. 
3) Carving out a “my way or the highway” marital life path for parishioners that are incompatible with modern life. Basically, you’re supposed to find someone, fall in love, and then get married. Can’t afford two rents or have to live so far apart from your small town families to earn a living wage? Too bad. Have excessive debt or loans and unable to afford a kid? Too bad, still have to do “natural family planning.” Is your ex spouse abusive to you? Let’s make a million hoops for you to jump through to ever get married to a life partner again. I guess the Catholic Church really expects young people  to somehow get some kind of post secondary education to earn a living wage, remain chaste through all of it, somehow afford a wedding in the tens of thousands of dollars immediately after that, and then start popping out kids.

In short, I feel like Catholicism failed a lot of my generation, at least in America. I can’t speak for anyone else.  But it seemed like the American conservative value of “personal responsibility” is always applied to everything, “got an objection?” Your own fault. “The church is perfect.” How is anyone going to be happy when they’re made to follow a religion the is almost impossible to actually live up to when you consider the conditions most Americans live in?",Catholicism

Question about adoption? Any Catholic adopting parents opinion would be appreciated 😊,SacredHeartsPromise,1621366807,"Hello! I posted these questions on adoption forums and subreddits but was largely attacked for being religious instead. I dont know what I expected... I thought people might be willing to overlook anti-religion for the sake of offering advice to someone wanting to adopt kids, but it appears not.

So instead I will ask here. My husband and I are looking to adopt a child. I had planned to before but then had a biological child and decided not to. But then I decided that God clearly intended me to do that because it would be a good deed and so I have once again been looking into adoption.

So the questions I have are:

a) Is transracial adoption a bad idea? I'm Asian and my spouse is white. Most catholic charities I contacted are primarily looking for parents for children from Haiti, West indies, africa and latin america (I believe they dont operate in the state itself (in US) because of some LGBT related issues.) I dont mind adopting a child from a different background and culture, in fact I think that is how most good can be done so if anything I am leaning towards that. But what challenges do you think one will face?

b) My h decided to check himself and found a Polish based Catholic adoption program. This seems really good because its tied directly with the Polish Catholic Church. This would not be transracial, is it a better option?

c) Some children are older than others. I have no experience with older children (my own is 2.5) but older children are generally more in need of a home than younger. Its morally better to adopt an older one, but I'm not sure if the challenge will be too great since I have no experience and I'm only 25 myself...

A real witch placed a curse on me and something terrible happened,NotJoking777,1621364043,"  About  10 years ago a witch placed a curse on me over the telephone. She said  in a wrathful voice, after speaking in a different language, that she has put a curse on me and if I ever talk bad about \_\_\_\_\_ (group of  people) that something very bad will happen.

Well,  I didn't believe in curses then and didn't for 9 years after that. It  was something I kinda just forgot about that happened. Well anyways, I  learned about this group of people that was doing bad things from the  internet. I talked bad about this group of people online and a little in  real life. I then remembered that I spoke to that witch before.

Well  somebody messaged me on the internet saying really bad stuff. I just  shrugged it off. I got scared though and stopped talking about this  group of people and changed my internet habits.

I  prayed to Jesus for that person who messaged me to not do what he was  saying. Then like 6 months later, I heard on the news that he did  something terrible.

So because I was cursed, did what the witch told me not to do, something terrible happened. Not to me but to other people.

Am  I still cursed or is that curse like broken now? I went to confession  after all this happened, but was to scared to tell the priest the whole  story. And I don't think he'd have the time to hear it all anyways since  I felt kind of rushed. But he gave me the absolution so I think I'm  good?

In light of the happenings in Germany I thought of an interesting scenario.  Though he hasn’t been as vocal as some would like to see, Pope Francis and the magisterium have been clear on the Churches teachings in regards to homosexuals not being able to be married. Praise be God!

If in the event the legitimate authority reversed course, as some believe possible, what is a faithful Catholic to do?  It would seem as though a reverse schism would happen in that scenario.  We couldn’t go to our local parish because they would be an extension of the Roman Authority and we’d have no legitimate leadership.

He followed with the question: what about people who never then become exposed to the truth of God and die without knowing him, inevitably going to Hell? How do they have a choice/ how is that fair? 

I heard somewhere that we have reason to believe that God, in His omniscience, provides each individual with the exact amount of info they need to be able to freely choose between the 2 paths...but he was very doubtful of this (perhaps from personal experience).

Translation help from French?,tails9117,1621359924,"Most of my religious education was done in French, and because of this I'm confused as to how similarly sounding yet seemingly differently defined words translate. More specifically, I'm talking about the term ""rosary"".

We Catholics have an object that I've seen being referred to as a rosary. It's a cross pendant with beads all around it, with each bead having prayer(s) related to them. Logically then, praying the rosary would mean doing all the prayers associated. However in French, the term for the pendant is ""chaplet"".

This is where it gets confusing. There is a French word, ""rosaire"", and it's the literal translation of rosary. However it's meaning is different. You see, where as in English the pendant is called rosary, and praying the rosary means doing it once (I'm assuming), the French word rosaire means going through the process three times, which is to say (for clarification) going all around the pendant three times.

There could be many possibilities here. It could be that the term rosary refers to the same thing, as in going through all the prayers three times. It could be that I've just been hearing things wrong this whole time. It could also be that there is no English word for ""praying the rosary"" three times.

When the Turks attacked Malta with an armada of nearly 200 ships and 40,000 soldiers in May of 1565, about 1,000 knights of St. John (later the Knights of Malta) from all over Christendom had already assembled to repel them. These men arrived at Malta with the full knowledge that many of them would never leave the island alive....[Read more...](https://gloriaromanorum.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-great-siege-of-malta-begins-may-18.html)",Catholicism

Do you believe that some people are born without a conscience?

Serial killers are one group of criminals that I find it hard to wrap my mind around, are such people born without a conscience? If so, are they still responsible for their crimes if they inherently do not know right from wrong? How would God judge a person? Is it merely a brain defect that can explain away the evil that we see in our world? 

What are your thoughts on this from a christian biblical perspective?

Blowing away the stench of the devil,Falandorn,1621332737,"Your mind is like a house in the country, inside it are many rooms and all around are picture frames on the walls. When you are young the house is new and fresh, the garden outside is tended by others and the windows are clean and open letting the cool fresh breeze blow gently through giving the air a clean composition. Some of you will have beautiful pictures hung on the walls by parents, friends and relatives, some of you may not.


As you get older if you are not mindful the house gets cluttered and dirty, the pictures fall and discolour, the windows get dusty and are harder to open. The air becomes stagnant and no longer fresh. The garden you are now old enough to tend becomes overgrown with weeds and thorns. 


Some of you will be attentive to cleaning your house, it is swept daily and dusted. The pictures are carefully looked after and new ones are added, the walls are decorated and the windows are thrown open each new day and the cool, fresh morning air blows through giving a sweet smell of the flowers carefully tended outside in a well kept garden. 


There is a basement in all these houses and a trapdoor leading to it. Unfortunately in *all* these houses the foundations are rotting and when the trapdoor creaks open the foul stench leaks through and permeates the interior. In the well kept houses the open windows soon clear this stench but in the other neglected ones the stench remains.


Try and reflect on how often you clean your house, what pictures hang on your walls, is your garden well kept? This week think about how a beloved friend would feel being invited to stay in your house for a few hours a week, would they enjoy their stay and relish the prospect or would they dread the thought?

What are some catholic charities and programs that help people with housing or a job?,galaxy8ty8,1621329542,"I'm an ex Muslim that has been wanting to become catholic for sometime. I'm currently overseas in a Muslim country (we'll call it country X) so that hasn't been possible. 

Aside from that, I've been able to not wear hijab and practice catholicism in private because i have my own apartment. 

Unfortunately I've lost my job and have to leave the country. 

I'm now moving back to the US. Unfortunately I'll have to live with my Muslim family until I find a job.

Ironically I've had more freedom living in X, because my parents aren't not living with me to police my clothing or religion. 

My family is very strict. I'll be forced to wear hijab again. Excepted to pray 5 times a day, and questioned if i dont. They also have some strong views about apostates. They believe that under an Islamic government, it's perfectly fine to kill an apostate. 


My plan was to work and then move out on my own. But now my parents are talking about how its dangerous for a woman to be out on her own in America. They said they only allowed me to stay in country X alone because its a Muslim country. They think i should stay with them.

My father in particular has a bad anger and i don't want a confrontation.

I've even considered living on the street than moving in with them. 

An online catholic friend I have suggested I reach out to some catholic organizations for help. I'm apprehensive about it because I feel like its begging.

Did an Irish Monk 'discover' America 1000 years before Columbus?,TJB74,1621328720,"The story of Brendan the Navigator is rich and can't so easily be dismissed as myth even though it has some pretty fantastical evidence 

* Celebrated as a Saint by Catholics, Anglican and Orthodox (that's around 80% of the global church)
* His book known as *Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis* (Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot) written in the 9th Century was hugely popular in Medieval Europe
* .It is though that Columbus learned from the Navigatio that the currents and winds would favor westbound travel by a southerly route from the Canary Islands, and eastbound on the return trip by a more northerly route, and hence followed this itinerary on all of his voyages.
* Being a *peregrinatio pro Christo (""*exile for Christ"") and putting yourself in God's hands in these tiny boats led Celtic Monks to found churches in Europe (Germany) and Brendan was looking for the Garden of Eden as he travelled across the Atlantic
* In 1976, adventurer,  Tim Severin  to built a traditional ship (cuurach) and demonstrated that such a journey was possible. 
* Its a great story and can be adapted to catechist classes, with sea monsters (whales) and Demons throwing fire and brimstone (Icelandic Volcanoes) and Great Crystal Pillars (Icebergs) 
*  J. R. R. Tolkien wrote a poem called ""The Voyage of Saint Brendan"", included in his time-travel story ""The Notion Club Papers"", published posthumously (1992) in Sauron Defeated.
*  He is the Patron Saint of Scuba Divers and researching this I have put a sticker in my car and say a prayer to him every time I set out

Why do people think if they lose their faith they'd become a horrible sinner?,hasbeenstillcatholic,1621310642,"First of all, I am an orthodox catholic who loves my faith. I struggle with sin just like anyone else, but in general most people would think I'm a moral guy. I don't cheat on my wife, I don't get drunk, I've overcome addictions. Granted I still have a lot of work to do. Still, even if I lost my faith in God, I wouldn't just go get drunk and cheat on my wife or just go around being a jerk. I'd still be me.

This makes me wonder, why do so many people seem to think that without God they'd just become libertines? I understand that without God there isn't a reason for morals on some level, but I'd argue that morals help a society function even without God. I'd still love my wife and my daughter. I'd still know that drinking too much would ruin my wife. I still would know that porn is not good to look at, even if I only did it to have a better life and not for God. So am I just prideful or what? I feel like its silly to just turn into a libertine sinner just because one doesn't believe in God anymore and I've never understood that. I guess that means then maybe I should thank God for giving me that moral compass and framework.

i know He has a plan for each and every one of us, im assuming mine was to dedicate time to care for other children of His, like friends and family

i guess my main questions are, is it sinful to be in a relationship outside of marriage knowing i can't have children anyway, or should wait til marriage even though i couldn't have a family? is it wrong to be married to a man knowing i couldnt give him children? would it be wrong of me to be with a man who could very well go be with another woman to be a proper father?

Except even the Nazis didn’t kill their own babies and not even the godless Communists didn’t allow gay “ marriage “.

(Politics Monday) Would it be wrong to kill a pro abortion politician if they were replaced by a pro life one?,hasbeenstillcatholic,1621304288,"First of all, I don't support any violence or even suggestion of violence against anyone, even for people as horrific as those who support abortion. That being said, would it be morally okay to kill a pro choice politician if a pro life one were to be appointed in their stead? Like say if you had a pro life president but a mostly pro choice supreme court and a case determining abortion ""rights"" coming up. Would such an act be moral? 

Also, another question, would it be wrong to be happy if a pro choice politician died naturally or was murdered? And would it be wrong to benefit from a thing like murder? I feel like it not only would be anti life, but it would also be kind of ghoulish and sad to be happy if someone died. Even benefitting from someone's death seems a bit ghoulish though maybe not necessarily wrong though personally to me it would be like winning a football game by knocking out the star QB of the other team and beating a bunch of scrubs.

Sorry for the dark question. I'm only asking because a small number of people have basically said they are okay with pro choice people and abortion doctors being killed though they ""don't support violence."" That to me feels sad. You shouldn't be happy for someone's death.

Am I thinking this right?,LoveByCandlelight,1621302092,"I fight OCD and scrupulosity. I haven’t been to confession since the third because I’ve tried to listen to the priest when he said to not go to confession except for at least every three weeks. I had been doing that, but then I started thinking about something someone had done to me that I felt was wrong. And I was feeling hateful to them. And having hateful thoughts. Each time I got them, I stopped myself. What I mean is there wasn’t a point where I was like “I don’t care if it’s wrong. I’m angry.” 

I kept having them even after I realized it was wrong but I kept ending (or trying to end them)

The thoughts and feelings came multiple times in succession and I just put them away. Does it become a mortal sin essentially when you say “I know it’s wrong but I don’t care, I’ll think it anyways.” 

One more thing. I assumed it was a mortal sin, maybe due to my worries, so I told God I’d go to confession tomorrow. But I told Him that I’d only go every 3 weeks, I made this promise, being in line with trying to fight my OCD. I don’t want to break it by not going, but I also feel like I don’t know if I need to! If I don’t need to go, is it ok to not go until it’s been three weeks? Or would I be sinning because I said I’d go tomorrow.

Question about Civil Law and Sin,Kaenoch,1621297048,"For the sake of argument, let's say that I live in a state, where, one day, the government came out and said that because YouTube banned their official state-run account, they are making it illegal to watch YouTube. Now, I know that you aren't bound to laws that violate the Catholic Church (such as, say going against a law that bans Catholicism outright or by implication), and that if the civil law and the church agrees on a law (murder for example), you are bound to follow that law. My question is, what about a law like the one above, where the church would allow it, but the state says you can't. I know the church generally supports the right of states to make laws, but, I'm unaware of anywhere where the church (the Holy See or other legitimate church authority, not some blog post on some obscure social media site) have said that disobeying this law is itself a sin. For example, the Cathecism states that it is morally obligatory to pay taxes for example, but also mentions that public authorities should allow man to exercise his freedom (which watching YouTube would do ), so, which takes precedent?

TL:DR: Would it be a sin to watch YouTube in a country where YouTube is banned, ""Bless me father for I have sinned, I was watching cat videos on YouTube.""

I don’t understand why I was banned from r/CatholicDating for “promoting sinful behavior”,Weather-Matt,1621288582,"Earlier today, a user posted in r/CatholicDating stating that he was gay and was seeking a partner. I commented, “I have a very good friend of mine who is a very conservative Catholic and bisexual. However, he’s in a relationship and I don’t think he’s very feminine per say. I will say it will probably be difficult for you to find someone on this sub. Is there any resources available to you in your area for meeting people? Best of luck.” 

Within the hour the post was deleted and I was temporarily banned for 50 days for “promoting sinful behavior”. I genuinely don’t understand how what I said was doing so. I was just trying to comfort the original poster. I do not support homosexuality.

I don’t understand how I was banned. I also don’t understand why there is such tension regarding homosexuality. I don’t understand why of all the possible issues in the world that there seems to be so much tension, and why trying to comfort someone of very different viewpoints from my own or Catholic doctrine appears to be so severely frowned upon.

Anyway should I have been banned? Has anyone else noticed such a trend in “Catholic” subreddits? Your commentary would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Dealing with attacks on my personal Catholic faith,amongstall,1621286971,"Every other day, especially with the situation in Israel, I come across people blaming religion for problems of this world. They say it promotes hate, it promotes violence. This leaves a hole in my heart and I cannot help but try to help them see the way of Christ. 

Unfortunately, no matter the kindness I show to them, I am called names and called “self-righteous” after I clarify that I don’t wish to cause them any harm or fight. Most all of this happens online but has not been limited to. 

I understand that this likely means they have hardened their heart to reject the word of God, which makes me want to try harder to help them. I’m told “it’s not my place,” but I know that he calls upon me to guide other towards him. 

I’ve come to realize that some will never come to change from me alone and i’ve accepted that. My issues arise when I receive amounts of hate that are personally harmful to me. 

I’m not a very sensitive person. I can deal with arguments just fine without getting emotional, and losing my composure. I’ve just found myself after the fact with a huge hole in my heart. It brings me a great sadness to know that someone could say things so hateful towards me about my faith. I am left feeling like a failure, and like nothing has been gained from the interaction, and I find myself not wanting to guide others in fear of being hurt.

The judgment seems to be a measure of one's heart, whether Christ was truly loved measured by one's treatment of the other.

In Catholic teaching, I sometimes hear a simplification that goes something like, ""To be saved you must be baptized and not commit a mortal sin.""

What’re your thoughts?,Jumpie,1621265237,"What're your thoughts on this?

tl;dr - masks required or not at Mass with restrictions being lifted.


This is in the US, but I can apply to any country. In my diocese starting next weekend, apparently the bishop is allowing pastors to make the decision whether or not masks are required or not. Needlessly to say, he wasn't happy the bishop put the ball in his court. He brought up a couple of scenarios:

1. Masks required for everyone
2. If vaccinated, no need to wear a mask
3. If not vaccinated, need to wear a mask
4. And, of course, based on one's preference

He's opting for not having to wear a mask if you have a strong conviction or preference not to based on your conscience. It seems like the easy way out, but it's not really. He sees it more of ""us against them"" scenario and not in the sense of the parish but in the country as a whole. It's in relation to Pres. Biden's statement Thursday where he said vaccinated folks don't need to wear masks. It's going to divide the country to even in that those who are vaccinated are going to shame those who aren't. This is the ""us against them."" You've all probably seen videos of someone shaming someone else for not wearing a mask doing their social justice warrior thing. 

He also likened it to the abortion stance ""my body, my choice"" theme. I can see this playing out like this: so you're ok with infecting hundreds of others? You should be more considerate and wear a mask (but with much more social anger). But it's not the same, though, because abortion kills 99.999% of the babies. So you see where this will go. 

I talked to my brother yesterday, and he said in the Pittsburgh diocese, it's sections for vaccinated and unvaccinated. This cause an uproar on the diocese's site and comments had to be removed because people were likening it to Nazi Germany. Again, with the ""us against them"" attitude. 

There could also be mandated vaccines employment. I know at my job (major US airline) it'll be for office workers masks optional if vaccinated; masks mandatory for those not. New hires will be required to be vaccinated. 

You know you'll see it coming: **Vaccine Passport Required for Entry** into a store. So there's that, too. 

Basically it all goes back to the devil causing discord and division among us ever since the beginning of this whole thing.

There were so many chains that the strictness of religious living that felt like they bound me. But ironically, now that I've been to the ""other side"", and lived the life of someone who was liberal, I testify that... there's something I cannot explain. A sense of peace? A sense of longing for something? Purpose? 

I found no better peace in my entire life compared to the peace that prayer brings. I used to pray the rosary every day and the Liturgy of the Hours. I hated that practice before, since my parents forced them on me.

What should I do if I feel that I'm losing my ability to reason?,Jazzlike-Business2,1621263341,"Sorry for venting. When I don't know what to do, I come here and I try to write what's on my heart.

I feel as if I am losing my ability to reason and I don't know what to do anymore. When I say that I'm losing my ability to reason, I mean I have problems with basic cognitive functions, like short-term memory, working memory, etc. I no longer understand things like causality, abstract thinking, logical thinking etc., as well as the things of life, despite my mind being very clear and, dare I even say, razor-sharp, just a few months back. In biblical terms (as per the Book of Proverbs), one could say that I am a fool (or something like that).

This is all aggravated by the fact that the mental health services claim that I had a psychosis a few months back. I, at the time, experienced no psychotic symptoms, which I also told them. But after being inside the asylum for 2+ months, where I was brought against my will due to the alleged psychosis, I started doubting the validity of my own experience. Doctor after doctor declared me to be severely mentally ill. Even though I did not believe it at first, I started questioning myself and my past experiences. This drove me to a form of insanity, a sense of not knowing who I am, and depression.

Because of my experiences, I feel I cannot trust myself or my own experiences. I feel as if I barely know who I am anymore. As a result, I have lost all zest for life that I had.

I have also written on this sub about my hardships in trying to find God. I want to hear his voice in my mind and heart, telling me what to do, showing the right path to take, but when I search my mind and heart, all I discover is a sort of emptiness. No coherent thoughts, no love for anyone (including myself), no dreams... just emptiness. It's a pretty painful feeling of cosmic disorientation.

I am also very tired of being called and branded ""mentally ill"" by the mental health establishment and my family. It has impacted my self-confidence and self-image very negatively.

I am wondering what to do next with my life, but I can't figure out what that next step should look like.  I don't understand what is wrong with me, or with my relationship with God. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice? I'm sort of despairing of my life and my situation.",Catholicism

Question about Holy Water and Sign of the Cross,T-BoneTurner,1621261157,"Good Morning Everyone,

Let’s say you were given “spiritual glasses” that allowed you to see not only things in the material world but also see things in the spiritual world.  You are sitting on a bench outside of a church during confession.  Three people walk out of the church each having given a good confession and in a state of grace.  
Person 1 walks out of the church and goes about their day.
Person 2 walks out of the church and does the sign of the cross on themselves before leaving.
Person 3 dips their hand in holy water and does the sign of the cross.

Using your “spiritual glasses” would you see any difference between the three?  If so what?  If not, then wouldn’t both the “Sign of the Cross” and Holy Water just be symbols and not practical items?

How should we behave towards Muslims?,zogins,1621251734,"I live in a country that is Catholic. Catholicism is listed as the state religion in our constitution. But our constitution also guarantees freedom of religion so there cannot be any discrimination against people of other faiths, or of no faith.

The problem is that the number of Muslims is increasing dramatically. They are increasing because they escape from their African countries and travel to Europe for a better life. Very often our army saves them from drowning in the Mediterranean sea as the try to cross from Africa to Europe in flimsy and over filled dinghies.

They arrive in Europe illegally but we cannot send them back to their country if there is any suspicion that they will persecuted.

Their number in our country is now a good percentage of our population. What was an almost exclusively Catholic country now contains a good proportion of Muslims. For the most part they are well behaved people. Sub Saharan Africans (not Arabs) are especially kind and thankful for what our country is providing them. But Arabs behave differently. They insist on trying to create trouble. They know that they are in a Catholic country, they also know that their freedom is guaranteed and they will never be persecuted but they do things to provoke us Catholics. For example they keep asking for permission to build more Mosques. The government allows this as long as the Mosque follows planning regulations. For example it cannot be higher than 3 storeys because buildings in my country try to maintain the character of the built environment. When permission to build higher (they want minarets) is forbidden they start protesting. Their protests sometimes involve disrupting normal life in my country.

They also hold Friday prayers on public thoroughfares, without police permission, and blocking the movement of people and traffic.

Our government, a few decades ago had given them a large tract of public land so that they could build a Mosque - they were even allowed a minaret but on condition that their 'priest' would not scream prayers from a loudspeaker at all times of night and day. They accepted this but recently, Muslims in private houses are piping out recordings of a Mullah (a Muslim man who shouts out prayers at set times like 5 am etc). Recently I slammed my windows loudly when I was woken up by the recording of a Mullah at 5 am. An Arab started shouting at me and calling me all sort of names. I was afraid for myself and my family. If I report them to the police they will know it is me.

What I am trying to say is that Islam is not a civilised religion and once we let them in they will try to take over.",Catholicism

True faith in Jesus Christ and love for others goes hand in hand.,zogins,1621250170,"One cannot exist without the other.

When I see some of the posts in this sub I realise how ignorant I am when it comes to our faith. I do not know how to argue using theological arguments, neither do I understand the deep teachings of the Church fathers. But I understand that I cannot love our Lord without loving my neighbours and all my human brothers and sisters.

In another post I wrote how a Dominican monk, after confession, gave me as a penance the duty to make a charitable contribution to a family in need.

I asked him - how much should I give? He answered - enough so that it hurts. He does not know my financial situation but he made it clear that real penance and repentance should be something that causes suffering.

For me that meant that the sum that I gave would be high enough to forbid me from indulging in something that I enjoyed like a nice dinner with wine. I had to go without such a 'luxury' to be able to carry out my penance.

I am writing this here as I wish that any priests reading this follow the example of this monk and use the sacrament of confession to teach us true repentance but above all use the penance to help others in need.",Catholicism

Numbering the Psalms,coinageFission,1621226680,"In the grand scheme of things, this is a very trivial matter to be quibbling over. But I like continuity enough to be bothered by the fact that we changed the way we divvied up the Psalter in recent memory, going by the Masoretic numbering rather than our traditional Septuagint count. (Summarized version: Psalms 9-10 are Psalm IX, 114-115 are Psalm CXIII, 116 is the combined Psalms CXIV and CXV, 147 is the combined Psalms CXLVI and CXLVII.) Why did we not retain the numbering arrangement we have always reckoned them by? Was it really necessary to conform to the Hebrew so scrupulously?

I suppose this is just me giving vent to my rambling thoughts on the matter. It seems to me that the more we make overtures to our Reformed brethren, the more we estrange ourselves from our Apostolic brethren — for the Masoretic numbering is the one the Protestants use, and the Septuagint numbering is the one the Orthodox use.",Catholicism

Dr.Brad Pitre and the Jewish Hallel,womanatcana,1621219581,"I love Dr.Brad's work and in his work on the Jewish roots of holy week, he refers to Jesus and the apostles singing a hymn during the last supper.  Matthew 26:26-30 

&gt; Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples  and  said,  “Take,  eat; this  is  my  body.”  And  he  took  a  cup,  and  when  he  had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you;for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I shall not drink  again  of  this  fruit  of  the  vine  until  that  day  when  I  drink  it  new  with  you  in  my Father’s  kingdom.”  **And when  they  had  sung  a  hymn**,  they  went  out  to  the  Mount  of Olives. 

He later cites Psalm 116:12-17 as the Psalm that Jesus sang. The verse mentioning the song of thy handmaid is most interesting to me.

&gt; What shall I render to the Lord for all his bounty to me? I will lift up the cup of salvationand call on the name of the Lord, I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. O Lord, I am thy servant; I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid. Thou hast loosed my bonds.

Would this be a grave matter?,CalculatorOctavius,1621218766,"
I am prescribed suboxone, which is a controlled medication used for opioid cessation. So I used to do drugs and have now been clean, with suboxone, for many years now. Suboxone can be abused, especially by non-addict/opioid user since it can provide a mild opioid-like effect. That’s why it is controlled. 

I do not abuse it. The last few days I have been suffering from a blindingly painful ear infection. It is easily the worst pain I have ever experienced, at least in recent memory. A true 10 out of 10 on the scale. Nothing but blinding existential despair. I’ve been praying and offering up this suffering for whatever soul in purgatory needs it most. 

I have gone to a doctor, and started antibiotics yesterday. In the meantime I’ve been taking ibuprofen and aleve for the pain, but in the last 24 hours I have taken already way way way more, like 10x more, than the maximum limit for 24 hour period as listed on the bottle. I have undoubtedly caused potentially irreversible liver or kidney damage at this point, but the ear pain I cannot handle. 

So my question comes in here. This medication I am prescribed, while I am not prescribed it for pain, it can sometimes (though less common than standard opioids) be prescribed for pai, due to its activity on the opioid receptors. So I have decided that in order to help somewhat with the pain, while protecting my body from further damage due to excessive NSAID’s, the best thing for me to do would be to take extra of my suboxone, taking a higher dose than I am prescribed, since I have already taken my full dosage for the day, and I will still have to be awake for another 5 or 6 hours tonight.  

The reason I am asking is because as this is a controlled medication, it is technically against the law of the land for me to do this, and also, abuse of medication for the pursuit of pleasure is identified as grave matter in the jp2 version of the catechism (I am not sure about in the Roman Catechism).

Some important details are: I am doing this for the relief of pain, and not the pursuit of pleasure. Though I am not a doctor, I am educated on the effects of drugs, especially this medication, and how it works in the body, as well as know my own body, and I know for a fact that doing this will not cause harm to my body. So to me it seems the only issue here would be the legal status, even though I won’t get in legal trouble obviously, I am wondering about the gravity according to the Church in this situation.",Catholicism

Finally I don’t understand whether or not it is a sin to say use a condom for the sake of not contracting an STD (in this hypothetical let’s say it’s in a marriage so there’s no other factors that play into it).

I want to know why he chose the word ""Verbo"" to translate ""Logos"", how does it relate to the philosophical concept of Logos and the literal sense of the word. In English we translate Logos as Word but Greek has like 4 words for ""Word"". In Spanish there is a divide between translations that prefer ""Verbo"" (Verb) while modern ones go for ""Palabra"" (Word).   


John 1:1 does not refer to the gramatical category ""Verb"" nor to ""Written word"" but to **The Eternal Word of God.** I still want to learn more about this, I am not an expert so I would appreciate if someone  could clarify the biblical and secular meaning of Logos, Rhema, Graphia, etc. But of course I think Jerome could help us a lot.

My sister takes my infant nephew to Mass even though she isn't married *in*  the Church.

Is it everyone appeasing me in order to keep me on the straight and narrow?

Mixed Emotions on the Ascension,496us1,1621207360,"  

Deacon Tom Caso

The beginning of John’s Gospel announces with great joy that “the Word became flesh and dwelt amongst us.” This captures how radically different the Judeo-Christian religion was from every other belief system in the Roman world. For most people, the idea that their gods would live among them would have been too intimidating. They were only too happy to escape the notice of their gods and often their sacrifices were meant to keep those gods away.

For us it is quite different. The Jewish people carried the Ark of the Covenant and the tent of meeting with them during their desert wanderings. God was present to them every step of their journey. For Christians, God takes on human flesh to physically live with His creation and to experience everything that they experience. The joy of having an all-loving God physically dwell amongst us is indescribable.

But now Jesus is ascending to heaven. That tangible, physical presence is seemingly going away. And on top of that, Jesus tells us in today’s Gospel that those who do not believe are condemned. Shouldn’t He have stayed and done more to convince them?

That sounds like a reasonable argument.  But if we stop and think about it, we know that no matter what He did there would still be some who did not believe. There were those Pharisees who saw Jesus perform miracles, but then complained He did so on the wrong day. There were those that witnessed Jesus feed thousands from just a few loaves – but then walked away when they thought His teachings were too difficult to follow. Personal witness alone is plainly not sufficient.

Contrast that with the way the faith spread like wildfire through the teachings of Paul and the original apostles. People who never knew Christ when He was alive were suddenly following His teachings. For the first time, they were introduced to real hope.

God knows us all too well. Yes, He is pursuing us. But He knows that if we do not reciprocate – if do not pursue Him – we will never become fully His. We will never develop the relationship that He offers us. 

He does not leave us alone by ascending to heaven. We know that He will send the Holy Spirit. But more importantly, He is always available to us. We just need to turn to Him. We need to pursue Him by shedding the things of this world that distract us from being with Him.

We pursue Him through prayer. We pursue Him through spreading the Gospel. We pursue Him through loving our neighbors.

Jesus has ascended to heaven. Now it is time for us to work on our relationship so that He is always present in our lives.",Catholicism

Evening prayer💛,rapunzel2003,1621203363,"Dear Father,
As I end my day, I want to thank you for the gift of being alive, for every beautiful encounter and every blessing that you give to me and my loved ones

As I lay my head on my pillow tonight, allow me to offer you my thoughts, my worries, my health, my anxiety, my sins, my desires, my happiness, my memories, my future and everything that matters to me. 
As I do so with an open heart, I rest reassured tonight, because I know that all that is given to you with love, you give it back to me with your great blessing and abundant love.

I ask you tonight to calm the raging sea of thoughts that occupy me, and replace them with faith and hope in you my Lord.

“You of little faith.” 

That’s what I remember you’d tell me if you could see how stressful I feel about every detail in my life.

Jesus, my savior, allow me rest knowing that you, and only you are the sailor of my life. 

Allow me to see my life and the world with new eyes, ones that trust you blindly and know that they are always guided by your light.

I pray tonight for those with heavy hearts, with worries overwhelming them and with raging minds filled with anxiety.

May every soul reading this know that you will bring the calm after the storm.

May every sick person be healed with your miracles.

May every broken heart be mended with the love you give to us every day.

May every homeless person find a shoulder to cry on, a brother to help them and a warm shelter.

May every sinful person turn away right now and walk towards you, may they realize that your forgiveness has no limits, if their regret and love to you come from the bottom of their hearts.

May every confused person be guided by the Holy Spirit’s wisdom, and trust the process of your work on their lives.

May every person on this earth have something to eat, something to wear and somewhere safe to stay.

God, remind us today and every day that we are your sons and daughters, that we are never alone, that we are made from love and light, and remind us to be grateful for your daily miracles.

I love you God, with my whole heart and soul. I love you forever.

Who goes to Heaven?,ntcmp_,1621192554,"I was having this conservation with my family today (we are all Catholics). 

I'm a Catholic in the traditional sense and believe that only Christians with good works and who believe in the Christian God will enter Heaven. 

My family however believes that any person of any faith (or lack thereof) can enter heaven if they live a moral life (so good works) and that literal faith In the Holy trinity as the true God is not necessary for salvation. For example, a devout Muslim may enter Heaven without belief in the Holy trinity. However, I believe this contradicts Jesus' words that only through Him may we enter Heaven.

 I replied that there is no plausibility with the claim that non-Christians do not have access to the claims and teachings of the Church in todays world (particularly in the West). They then explained that knowledge of the existence and claims of Jesus and the Church are not enough to be considered ""informed"" of God, since an upbringing ina different faith would make it difficult to come to know Christ personally (which I agree with, but still think that knowledge of the teachings is enough).

The Resilience of the Church Part one - Japans Hidden Christians,TJB74,1621186351,"The Shimabara Rebellion, an uprising of mostly Catholic peasants, was the largest civil conflict in Japan during the Edo period. An estimated 37,000 rebels and sympathizers were executed by beheading, and the Portuguese traders suspected of helping them were expelled from Japan.  Japan entered a period of national seclusion and persecution of Christianity until the 1850s, which included todays executions of 26 Christians who were executed by crucifixion at Nagasaki. Franciscan missionaries and converts linked to them, and also three Jesuit priests killed. 

When Christian missionaries returned to Japan 250 years later, they found a community of ""hidden Catholics"" that had survived underground, the famous ‘Kakure Kirishitan’. The ""hidden"" Christians continued to practice Christianity in secret. The saints and the Virgin Mary were transformed into figurines that looked like the traditional statues of the Buddha and prayers were adapted to sound like Buddhist chant. The Bible and other parts of the liturgy were passed down orally. The majority of them rejoined the Catholic Church after renouncing unorthodox, syncretic practices. However, a group on *Ikitsuki* Island which had been overlooked by the Japanese government, made their beliefs public in the 1980s and now perform their rituals for audiences. 

The anthropologist Christal Whelan uncovered some *Kakure Kirishitans* on the Gotō Islands. There were only two surviving priests on the islands, both of whom were over 90, and they would not talk to each other!!

 Shūsaku Endō published an influential novel called ‘Silence’. It is haunting in its depiction of a God who has chosen not to eliminate suffering, but to suffer with humanity. A sensation, it received Japans most prestigious literarty award, the Tanizaki Prize and was soon translated all over the world. 

Martin Scorsese turned it into an Oscar nominated film in 2018. Scorsese who had trained to be a priest before a career shift had read the novel as a young man, it had made a deep impression on him, and he had even written an introduction to recent editions of the novel.

What the Church really teaches about sin,CookieAdventure,1621184441,"There has been so much confusion about what the Catholic Church teaches about sin in the media, it is time to add some clarity. First of all, God is love. God loves all people - ALL people - and wants us to be with him. Serious sin is the conscious decision to move away from God.

Serious sins are anything that is forbidden by the 10 Commandments:

\- Love God, not other stuff like money, sports, fame, power, and more. You can enjoy this other stuff, just put God first. Pride is a big one here. Loving our own opinion more than God's is a serious sin.

\- Don't swear using God's name. Yes, this is a serious sin.

\- Don't blow off going to church. There are valid reasons for not going to church (I can't get to one, I have to work or I'm sick) but consciously deciding to not go to church on Sunday (or Saturday night services) is a serious sin.

\- Be respectful to your father and mother. This includes all people older than you and your other family members; yes, including siblings. You might have had lousy parents and getting away from them for self-preservation is okay but don't treat them badly in return.

\- Don't take stuff that isn't yours. This includes sharing your Netflix password with friends or downloading music for free that should have been paid for. This includes cheating on a test or taking home that pen from the office or a towel from the hotel.

\- Don't commit adultery. This one is pretty clear. Divorce is okay in the Catholic Church IF the spouse has to get away from an abusive or dangerous situation (of course, talk to your priest first). Adultery comes up when the divorced person tries to remarry. This issue also includes sex outside of marriage. Look below about coveting for more details.

\- Don't kill ... specifically don't MURDER. Of course, physically murdering someone is a big no-no. Self-defense or defense of another innocent person is not murder, though. But have you also emotionally or spiritually murdered someone? Have you bullied, participated in hazing, or been just plain mean? And this also means don't have an abortion. Don't encourage someone to have an abortion. Don't pay for an abortion. Don't vote for politicians hoping they'll use taxpayer money to fund abortions. Don't drive them to the abortion clinic. Again, this is a big topic and there are further resources on the internet.

\- Don't lie. Don't gossip. Even ""little white lies"" are a big sin. Don't lie by omission. You don't have to be mean when telling the truth (""Does this dress make me look fat?"") and you don't have to tell people private stuff (""When did you lose your virginity?"") just because they asked. Answers like ""I think your other outfit is more flattering"" or ""that's private so I'm not going to answer"" are okay.

\- Don't covet your neighbor's spouse (or anyone else). Isn't this like adultery? Yeah, sort of. It is about thinking of doing it and includes anything where we aren't respecting other people. The sin is in objectifying people; treating them like something to possess or use instead of human beings with whom we want a relationship. This includes asking someone to text nude pictures of themselves or looking at pornography. This issue is all related to the Church's teaching on ""theology of the body"" and is a pretty big topic.

\- Don't covet your neighbor's stuff. In short, don't try to keep up with the Joneses. Being jealous or envious because other people have or do something you don't is not a good look. But then again. flaunting your new stuff or success is pretty sinful, too.

So, those are the biggies. Yes, swearing God's name and blowing off church is just as big a sin as having an abortion or having sex outside of marriage. Who knew, right? And here everyone is making a big deal about homosexuality and stuff when there are people sitting in a church right now who took home printer paper from the office! All these sins are SERIOUS - equally serious. All have to be confessed and all have to not be committed again (which is hard to do ... we know that.)

Does this mean if you commit any of these sins you are excommunicated? No. But you should go to confession.

Does this mean if you commit any of these sins, God and the church people hate me? No! God loves you and wants you. The church people might have their own sins to contend with but if they are trying to be good Catholics, they'll hate the sin, not the sinner.

Does this mean if you commit any of these sins you can't go to church? No. As a matter of fact, if you're consciously committing these sins, you should probably make a point to go to church.

Does this mean if you commit any of these sins you can't receive communion during church? Yes. You have to go to confession first. If you're truly sorry, all is forgiven. If you aren't truly sorry, go to confession anyway so you can talk about it. You have to knowingly be doing something wrong to make it a big sin. In other words, you have to KNOW it is wrong and decide to do it anyway.",Catholicism

What're your thoughts on this?,Jumpie,1621180556,"tl;dr - masks required or not at Mass with restrictions being lifted.

&amp;#x200B;

This is in the US, but I can apply to any country. In my diocese starting next weekend, apparently the bishop is allowing pastors to make the decision whether or not masks are required or not. Needlessly to say, he wasn't happy the bishop put the ball in his court. He brought up a couple of scenarios:

1. Masks required for everyone
2. If vaccinated, no need to wear a mask
3. If not vaccinated, need to wear a mask
4. And, of course, based on one's preference

He's opting for not having to wear a mask if you have a strong conviction or preference not to based on your conscience. It seems like the easy way out, but it's not really. He sees it more of ""us against them"" scenario and not in the sense of the parish but in the country as a whole. It's in relation to Pres. Biden's statement Thursday where he said vaccinated folks don't need to wear masks. It's going to divide the country to even in that those who are vaccinated are going to shame those who aren't. This is the ""us against them."" You've all probably seen videos of someone shaming someone else for not wearing a mask doing their social justice warrior thing. 

He also likened it to the abortion stance ""my body, my choice"" theme. I can see this playing out like this: so you're ok with infecting hundreds of others? You should be more considerate and wear a mask (but with much more social anger). But it's not the same, though, because abortion kills 99.999% of the babies. So you see where this will go. 

I talked to my brother yesterday, and he said in the Pittsburgh diocese, it's sections for vaccinated and unvaccinated. This cause an uproar on the diocese's site and comments had to be removed because people were likening it to Nazi Germany. Again, with the ""us against them"" attitude. 

There could also be mandated vaccines employment. I know at my job (major US airline) it'll be for office workers masks optional if vaccinated; masks mandatory for those not. New hires will be required to be vaccinated. 

You know you'll see it coming: **Vaccine Passport Required for Entry** into a store. So there's that, too. 

Basically it all goes back to the devil causing discord and division among us ever since the beginning of this whole thing.

Hay gente que dice “ojalá viera un milagro para creer en la existencia de Dios”. Y la verdad es que estamos rodeados de milagros y no nos damos cuenta. La palabra milagro deriva del latín ""mirabilis"" del cual deriva también maravilla. De modo que milagro y maravilla comparten la misma raíz etimológica. Por lo que podemos decir Milagro = Maravilla. San Agustín decía, ""llamamos milagros a las maravillas súbitas y leyes naturales a las maravillas lentas"". Pero todo es milagro, en el sentido de que su explicación última permanece en el misterio. Estamos rodeados de “mirabilis” y no nos percatamos de ello. Precisamente porque los vemos todos los días y porque hay demasiados mirabilis para nuestras mentes pequeñas, lo cual impide la captación del fenómeno. Lo que sucede es que mucha gente tiene una visión reduccionista del milagro y piensa que un milagro sólo sería algo así como un muerto que resucita. Pero un niño que nace no nos parece un milagro. Y no nos parece milagro –reitero– porque lo vemos todos los días. Si viéramos todos los días muertos resucitar, tampoco nos llamaría la atención. Pero, ¿qué es mayor milagro? ¿Un muerto que resucita o un niño que nace? Ya Pascal, el gran científico y filósofo francés, se planteó este problema y concluyó, sin sombra de duda, que es mayor milagro un niño que nace que un muerto que resucita. El muerto que resucita recupera algo que ya tenía y que de suyo le pertenece. El niño que nace en cambio es el advenimiento de un nuevo ser al cosmos, único e irrepetible. Estremece pensarlo...                                                                                                                                                                     Digamos de paso que si no caemos de rodillas frente a cada nacimiento es porque somos mentecatos, esto es “mentis captus” o mentes cautivas, con la cabeza llena de insensateces materialistas.

For non-belivers that think they can live morally without Christ,TyroneLannister97,1621170881,"Yes you can find morality and not be religious, but I ask you, can you find true peace? Can you live with forgiveness of your enemies? Is there a person in your life that would die for you? Or love you unconditionally? Man and woman, both love for worldly gains, safety, security, healthy offspring. Though all this is for gain , it is not unconditional love, take away the gains and conditional love has been uncloaked. Jesus does not want your physical belongings, he will love you even if you are a broken and sinful person, he wants to help you to become better, a more righteous person. It is like parental love but the parent knows everything that is good for you, and forgives you despite your short falls. Jesus Christ is truly real, and if you just pray to him, ask him to show you the path to him, and he will show you, and at the end of that path you will find peace within him. If choose to walk it, it will not be an easy one, he will support you and walk with you down the path.",Catholicism

Vatican II Must be Interpreted as an Enrichment of the Faith,pinkfluffychipmunk,1621169282,"Good morning and happy Ascension Sunday! 

Over the course of the last year I have been researching Vatican II and have been slowly posting it as I complete projects to here. My current work has been in hermeneutics and today I present to you Part III. The basic thesis is that Vatican II must be interpreted as an enrichment of the faith. Since Part III is about 130 pages, I broke it up into nine webpages. 

[Part III.1](https://www.lenouvelesprit.com/vatican-ii-hermeneutics/hermeneutic-of-faith) develops the hermeneutic of faith by examining what the Council taught about faith, then arguing that the Council understood itself as an exercise of the Church's very own faith. Hence, Vatican II must be interpreted and implemented as an exercise of faith. 

Part III.2 is broken up into several smaller sections. The overall theme is how to apply the hermeneutic of faith to various controversial subjects concerning the Council. [Part III.2.1](https://www.lenouvelesprit.com/vatican-ii-hermeneutics/address-to-man) explores the meaning of the Council's address to modernity and the world. [Part III.2.2](https://www.lenouvelesprit.com/vatican-ii-hermeneutics/hermeneutic-of-dialogue) develops the meaning of dialogue. [Part III.2.3](https://www.lenouvelesprit.com/vatican-ii-hermeneutics/the-pastoral-council) develops the true meaning of Vatican II's pastoral nature and its concept of renewal. [Part III.2.4](https://www.lenouvelesprit.com/vatican-ii-hermeneutics/hermeneutic-of-aggiornamento) addresses the meaning of aggiornamento. [Part III.2.5](https://www.lenouvelesprit.com/vatican-ii-hermeneutics/ad-intra-ad-extra) investigates the meanings of ad intra and ad extra. [Part III.2.6](https://www.lenouvelesprit.com/vatican-ii-hermeneutics/spirit-of-vatican-ii) examines the Spirit of Vatican II, arguing that this Spirit is none other than the Holy Spirit. [Part III.2.7](https://www.lenouvelesprit.com/vatican-ii-hermeneutics/ambiguity-and-vatican-ii) explores various claims about Vatican II's ambiguity, arguing that this is a false hermeneutic and that those who argue such are utilizing the hermeneutic of suspicion. 

[Part III.3](https://www.lenouvelesprit.com/vatican-ii-hermeneutics/hermeneutic-of-suspicion) develops a twofold meaning of the hermeneutics of faith and suspicion and their application to Vatican II.

Can a person build and strengthen values from relationship? Can it really work out and last?,polly-1,1621167578,"My boyfriend \[26 M\] and I \[22 F\] have similar backgrounds and have been brought up in a similar manner to each other. We haven't been together long but we've started discussing real important life issues, beliefs and values which I really appreciate and enjoy. I love to learn more about him and what he thinks and believes and learn from each other. However, it seems that due to our current society and its ever-changing beliefs (with regards to Catholic teachings, but also general thinking and values that one should hold and practice) or lack-thereof it seems like we vary a little on the subject of values and such. Thing is, I hold very strongly to what I believe in and I always try to search and learn more about Church teachings but also, the reasons behind the teachings and beliefs. I want to know WHY I should do such and such and not do something else. I believe if there is no reason behind a teaching, or, maybe better put, no understanding of the reasons behind the teachings of the Church, one can easily drift from what is thought and do as the rest of society does and not hold strong to one's beliefs. And this is what concerns me. My boyfriend understands the teachings of the Church, what is taught and what is right and wrong (I believe), but since everyone else around him doesn't really practice what they preach, I feel like he is easily swayed to do as they do because it's as if he's the odd one out, as if he's this strange guy with stupid unreasonable beliefs. So he does what others do because maybe it's the right thing to do; because that's the normal thing to do nowadays.

I'm 'scared' / worried that due to this he can easily be swayed to do whatever someone else says. I think it's fundamental that a person has strong beliefs and principles and will recognise and do anything to do the right thing when confronted with what's right and wrong. I'm scared that if he doesn't have these strong beliefs and principles he won't be there and truly love me for who I am and help me grow and become the best I could be. I'm scared that if he's easily influenced by what others think he won't trust ME completely and truly discuss everything with ME and make our discussions and reasonings a priority before anyone else's.

I'm sure I mustn't be the only person who thinks and worries such things because I would like for this relationship to work out and last a lifetime. Do you maybe have any thoughts or words of wisdom regarding such issues? I would love to hear others' thoughts and perceptions so that maybe I can learn from others' experiences so that I can personally grow more.

Thanks in advance.",Catholicism

A Catholic Manifesto for the 21st Century (a reaffirmation of sound Catholic teaching to end division in the Church),LanguageGeek95,1621160003,"Anyone who moves in Catholic circles knows that there is intense division at the moment on so many lines. I wrote a series of sixteen points in response to a video post on this matter in an attempt to bring an end to this incessant fighting and get back to the fundamentals of our beautiful faith. I have decided to leave the edits to show the development of this series.

&amp;#x200B;

1. We believe in one God Who is a Trinity of Three Divine Persons.
2. God created man. Man, tempted by Satan, turned against God and brought disorder and death into the world.
3. God became a man to suffer, die and rise again to restore order and destroy death so that all who believe in Him might be saved.
4. This man was Jesus Christ Who founded one Church and one Church only.
5. Save for invincible ignorance and the absence of mortal sin, anyone who does not believe in Jesus Christ, is not baptised and does not submit to the authority of His Church shall not see eternal life.
6. Anyone, inside or outside the Church who dies in a state of mortal sin shall not see eternal life.
7. In light of points 6 and 7, we dare not hope that all men are saved *\[edit: we may hope that all men now living be saved, but we know from Jesus' own prophetic warnings, his statement that it would have been better for Judas if he had never been born, and multiple approved apparitions of hell, that there are souls who have been condemned there eternally\]*.
8. *\[Edit: Those who die in a state of mortal sin are condemned to hell, a place of eternal punishment.*
9. *Those who do not die in a state of mortal sin but are still attached to sin shall go through a process of purification in Purgatory, after which, they shall enter into heaven.*
10. *Those who do not die in a state of mortal sin and are completely detached from sin, shall enter into heaven immediately.\]*
11. *\[Edit: Man is saved by grace alone (Ephesians 2:8) through faith and works (St. James 2:24). Man receives grace through baptism. He who is baptised can rightfully call himself a child of God. Man increases in grace by participating in the sacraments, most notably, the Holy Eucharist Which we believe is the true body and blood of Jesus Christ under the appearance of bread and wine and not a symbol. Because the Holy Eucharist is the true body and blood of Jesus Christ, man must not receive Him in a state of mortal sin (1 Corinthians 11:27). To return from a state of mortal sin to a state of grace, a man must confess his sins to a priest to receive absolution. There is no sin too grave that a priest cannot forgive.\]*
12. We love everyone because God is love, but we cannot and will not affirm relationships which defy that which God has ordained, *id est*, an unbreakable union between one man and one woman who freely give themselves entirely to each other in love which is open to the creation of new life bound by the sacrament of holy matrimony.
13. The Church only teaches the truth, not what people want to be true (the Church is not a democracy).
14. People are people from the very point of conception and possess the same human rights as any other man, for all rights come from God and not from any temporal authority. To kill a person in the womb is of equal moral gravity, if not more, as to kill a full grown man.
15. The seat of St. Peter is not vacant but is currently occupied by Pope Francis I. The Pope is the head of the universal Church, and all the faithful must assent to his teachings on faith and morals which he pronounces as the successor of St. Peter; however, no man has to assent to his opinions and must not when they contradict Church teaching. All Catholics have a duty to pray for the Pope and all the clergy **and owe all of them a duty of reverence and filial piety, even when they are wrong.**
16. (I say this as a Trad) The Novus Ordo Mass is legitimate, and no Catholic should disdain a brother for preferring this form of liturgy provided it is free of liturgical abuse.

If I have missed anything or have erred, of your charity, please correct me, and I shall humbly accept it.

Today's reading,BeautifulGenius10,1621148657,"I've been wondering about the daily readings from the past month:

""**Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you in my name.**"" ( John 16:23) (May 15, 2021)

""**I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.**"" ( John 15:16) (May 14, 2021)

""**If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.** **8By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples.**"" (John 15:7-8) (May 5, 2021)

""**Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son;** **14if you ask anything in my name, I will do it.**"" (John 14:13-14) (May 3, 2021)

I've been asking but haven't received many things I asked for, so I was wondering if I was doing something wrong.

Then today's reading was:

MARK 16:15-20

**15And he said to them, ""Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.** **16He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.** **17And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;** **18they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.""**

But I have yet to personally meet anyone who casts out demons in Jesus's name, speaks in new tongues, picks up serpents, is not hurt after drinking any deadly thing, and heals the sick by laying their hands on the sick.

Does that mean no one I personally know believes although they've been baptized?

Please don't say stuff like ""it's not literal"", ""it's not the right time"" (I often prayed including specific time frames), ""God's ways are different"" (I already prayed to God to align my will to God's and only want what God wants and only pray for things that God wants and I see no reason why God would not want to grant me that prayer), ""because you're sinful"", ""because what you ask for is not in your best interest"" (I already prayed to God to make me only want and pray for things that are in my best interest and I don't know why God would not want to grant me that prayer except maybe to give me patience but I'm sick of it, I want what I want now), ""because you're not open to God's graces"", ""it's your fault (without specific examples)"", ""we cannot understand God's ways"", ""God is not a vending machine"", ""different interpretations"", etc. If God said something is true, it should be true. If someone says A but A is not true then the person is a liar, we can't keep making excuses saying ""different interpretations"" blah blah blah. If a person says a certain ice cream is strawberry flavored then it turns out to be chocolate flavored then the person is a liar. Besides, God must know our intellectual capacities so why would God intentionally say things that are misleading even when using human language to communicate to humans?

Maybe do I just have to be persistent because Jesus did talk about the parable of the persistent widow. How persistent do I need to be?",Catholicism
"A parishioner drops their communion &amp;, not knowing what to do, tries to leave the church without consuming it",ferio252,1621148222,"We had an unfortunate incident during mass today, a young woman dropped her communion, picked it up, and returned to her seat. 

Thankfully, my brother observed this, confronted her, and filled with adrenaline, almost shouted at her to consume it immediately despite her Mother's confusion, ""What the big deal was, she'll consume it when we get to our car.""

Another elder parishioner stepped in, confiscated the host and returned it to our priest for proper disposal as per our Church's guidelines. 

According to my brother, this young woman said, ""I'm freaking out"" was clearly disturbed by my brother's forceful way of dealing with her, and left in tears.

Yes, my brother could've dealt with this more tactfully, but then again, he is who he is and it's literally our Lord.

I'm re-telling this because it's a good idea, imo, to remind EM's (and maybe our fellow parishioners) how to properly deal with someone leaving without immediately consuming our Lord or if it's dropped.

It's especially noteworthy considering many of us are returning to mass for the first time in over a year. If there's a mask mandate still in effect, receiving our lord and dealing with a mask increases the chances of being dropped.",Catholicism
Would like some advice on friendship(s),82738273,1621148050,"So I like to play D&amp;D with a group that I found online. We later asked another person to be our dungeon master.

As a foreword, I am bisexual. That doesn't mean I plan on acting on that at all. That's just describes what I find beautiful sometimes as I understand the Theology and philosophy and do my best to follow Christ as everyone else. This will become relevant later.

We got along great until I was stupid enough to get baited into a dialogue about the issue of transgenderism. Stupid, I know. 

Long story short, he ended up calling me a transphobe (which I am not) and a bigot (which again, I am not). If I was, I wouldn't deny it. 

I haven't told him, because I don't think it's relevant (maybe it would be, I do not know) and I don't think he will believe me anyway (and quite frankly, I'm embarrassed about it) I also experience a degree of gender/sex dysphoria sometimes. And before some people freak out, I am a biological male and I intend to keep it that way.

Anyway, since then he has been very much hostile toward me in ways that he is not to other members of the group. He will get triggered and go off on me by jokes that he or other members of the group make consistently. Other people in the group also think that he has an issue with me.
He has used rhetoric like ""you Christians"" in a accusatory way. 
I feel like he doesn't see me as a person anymore. It reminds me of the idea of Ideological possession. He has put me in the ""bad people"" group the same way a radical Soviet would put a landlord in the ""bad people"" group, regardless of their character. I'm scared, although am willing to try, to have a private dialogue with him and focus on relationship restoration.

So the question is, is it unchristian to cut people off? I love him and respect him, but it is clear that he does not respect me. 
I am hesitant to quit the group because that would not be showing friendship and love, even if we disagree on some things. I try to make a point of everyone being a friend to everyone, even if they do not make themselves MY friend. 

I don't think I'm particularly wise in this area.

What do you I am doing and/or have done wrong? Please know have nothing but good intentions and want to genuinely learn and try to make this better if I can.

"Grief, trouble, sorrow, and strange stuff",chateaumojo,1621147937,"I come from a large, conservative Catholic family.   Catholic schools all the way, lots of kids, observant, respectable, upper middle class.

BUT 

My mom was a borderline personality narcissist and an alcoholic and a smoker.  She was crazy mean to me almost my whole life.  My dad is emotionally not there and is just a big nerd, but also mean to me and others.  I tried to observe the 4th commandment anyway, but it was not easy.  They are both past 90.

Last year Mom fell and broke her hip.   She recovered fine and was walking again with a walker .  She did have post surgical or hypoxia dementia, at that point.  The last three days when I came to visit her after her accident, she was so nice to me. It was great, but also so painful to realize what I'd never had before.  It was weird and heart breaking, somehow.

When she fell, she said he pushed her and took hours to call an ambulance.  He said she was drunk and passed out.  To me, either one is plausible.

Then She got stomach pains, was taken to hospital (during Covid) , and was constipated so that she got peritonitis and died. 

He had been caring for her a lot and greatly resented it.  He called himself ""Doris"" and said he was like a maid.  Turns out all he had been feeding her was grilled cheese sandwiches.  He said she wouldn't eat anything else, but that seems unlikely.  She had been saying he was wearing her clothes sometimes, as in WTF??     No one could visit due to COVID.

I wonder if he killed her on purpose.  He sure seems chipper now she's gone.  He threw most of her things away already.

Could a Conversion Be Identified As Both Predestination and Free Will?,ChrisByrd1,1621133339,"Perhaps, maybe, God uses the Mormon Church, and other false churches, to lead us to Him. He knows all the sins we are going to commit and makes a way for us to know Him before we convert and are baptized in the Catholic Church, keeping the sins prebaptismal and thus forgiven.

Confirmation with a q-tip: is it valid?,bookquestionaccount,1621129982,"In my diocese I am going to be confirmed in a few weeks, and we have been told that we're going to have confirmation in which the oil is done not with hands but with a q-tip.  Is this a valid confirmation?  CCC 1300 says:  
   
 \&gt;The essential rite of the sacrament follows. In the Latin rite, ""the sacrament of Confirmation is conferred through the anointing with chrism on the forehead, which is done by the laying on of the hand, and through the words: 'Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti' \[Be sealed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.\].""In the Eastern Churches, after a prayer of epiclesis the more significant parts of the body are anointed with myron: forehead, eyes, nose, ears, lips, breast, back, hands, and feet. Each anointing is accompanied by the formula: ""The seal of the gift that is the Holy Spirit.""

If you got to run faith formation in your parish....,spiralboundmastrmind,1621128758,"My husband and I have been asked to join the parish commission on faith formation. We sat down and chatted with our pastor about it a bit, and he indicated that he asked us because we're young, involved, and likely to have fresh ideas. Like many parishes in the US, ours is mostly full of old ladies. Current FF is spotty at best (children &amp; men's ministries), non-existent in places (family, young adult, singles, non-old lady adult groups) and sometimes heretical at worst (high school). 

Hubby and I have helped start new ministries for over a decade now and have many, many ideas. It's a favorite topic of ours to discuss. We're aware of what kind of social/political undercurrents we're walking into. We know how much work reshaping efforts can be. But we've never had to help advise/shape the *entire philosophy* of a parish's faith formation program. So here are my questions. Feel free to answer any or all.

1. What do you see as the primary goal of faith formation? Increase in parishioners? Increased personal holiness? Improved retention of young people? Something else?
2. Best experience you've had in a faith formation &amp; why.
3. What logistical underpinnings help make faith formation run better? Small groups, offer baby sitting, home vs parish hall settings, etc etc etc (gah there's so much to think about.)
4. What can we learn from other faith's formation programs? (Like Protestants, Mormons, Jews, etc) I'd be especially interested in hearing any convert's perspectives.

Never heard so much clapping during Mass in my life! Am I no fun?,squiglesthesquirrel,1621119680,"My local church, although a 10 minute walk, has been troublesome for years now (drums/ukelele during Mass, 'clarifying' Church teaching on homosexuality and calling the Vatican 'too harsh', always talking about political issues in the homily instead of anything relating to the reading, clapping during church music) but I still go because it's where my grandparents went (and now I'm the only one who still attends church on both sides of the family). 

There were a lot more people in church than usual today, particularly young folk, so I was happy to see the increase in attendance, especially since I'm usually the youngest (21).

Well it turns out this Mass is supposed to be a celebration for the graduating Catholic high schoolers. So after the priest ended his homily (which was about Galileo and how no on believed the earth revolved around the sun before him [wrong]) they had a 15 minute celebration where each student would be called to the front of the congregation and everyone would clap for those getting scholarships/awards.

I, however, did not clap. I remember reading from Cardinal Ratzinger that church isn't meant to celebrate human achievement and [how clapping is bad in church](https://www.apostoliviae.org/resources/9654/is-it-okay-to-applaud-at-mass-heres-what-popes-have-said-about-it), and I found it disrespectful we were spending more time congratulating students than celebrating God. 

Then after the Eucharist, before Mass was ended, they called up all graduating high schoolers, gave them blankets, and we were to clap again. Then they started playing music and the high schoolers tried to be funny and start a 'clap to the music' thing.

Am I no fun? I found it lame and disrespectful. The students themselves viewed it ironically! I would be more OK with it if it was it's own separate graduation celebration (after Mass)...but they put it straight in the middle of Mass.",Catholicism

He is a theologian, with an extremely deep understanding of our faith. Apart from that he is active in our community and he has done incredible things to help those who are suffering.

Confession with him was not the usual kneeling down in a confessional. We sat down in a room and talked for over an hour. He wanted to understand whether I felt true repentance. 

At the end he forgave my sins but the penance that he gave me was this: I want you to do something that hurts you but helps other people. I asked for clarification. We settled on my donating money to a family that was suffering because of poverty. I asked him how I could do such a thing. He asked me whether I knew of families that were suffering and when I told him that I was not sure he gave me a list of possibilities.

Los tres monjes y el diablo.,cabrerafabi,1621108856,"Los tres monjes y el diablo

En una ocasión, el demonio se apareció a tres monjes y les dijo: “si os diera potestad para cambiar algo del pasado, ¿qué cambiaríais?”

El primero de ellos tenía un gran fervor apostólico y le respondió:
“Impediría que hicieses caer a Adán y Eva en el pecado para que la humanidad no pudiera apartarse de Dios”.  

El segundo de ellos era un hombre lleno de misericordia y le dijo: “Impediría que tú mismo te apartases de Dios y te condenaras eternamente”.
El tercero de ellos era el más simple y, en vez de responder al tentador, se puso de rodillas, hizo la señal de la cruz y oró diciendo: “Señor, libérame del demonio de lo que pudo ser y no fue“.

El diablo, dando un grito estentóreo y estremeciéndose de dolor se esfumó.
Los otros dos, sorprendidos, le dijeron: “Hermano, ¿por qué has reaccionado así?”.

Él les respondió: 
“En primer lugar, porque nunca hemos de entrar en diálogo con el enemigo. 
En segundo lugar, porque no hay poder en este mundo capaz de cambiar el pasado.
De todos los demonios, el que más atrapa a los hombres y les impide ser felices es el de lo que pudo ser y no fue. 
En tercer lugar, porque el interés de Satanás no era que probásemos nuestra virtud, sino que, atrapados en el pasado, descuidáramos el presente, porque es el único tiempo en el que Dios nos da su gracia y podemos cooperar con ella para amar su voluntad.

El pasado queda a la Misericordia de Dios; y el futuro a su Providencia. Solo el presente está en nuestras manos“.",Catholicism

I am not complaining that the priest did something wrong, of course he has to tell me when i commit a grave sin.

So far so bad, but my father is her legally apointed proxy ( its not that difficult here in Germany) who can decide if she is kept on life support or ""allowed to die"" ( e.g being killed by stopping of ventilation and feeding). The laws here are so crappy that he might even decide like that if there is no imminent possibility of death. Since he is suffering so much he sounds like he would rather put an end to his horror than to have horror without end.

I don't know how to handle this situation and my priest is currently ( thanks corona) not easily reached.

On one hand I don't want to be disrespectful to my father ,endanger the fragile relationship to my ( possibly) only remaining parent, while having no chance of swaying his mind or having a legal option to overrule his decisions.

On the other hand , what he might be about to do feels like murder to me and it hurts so much not being able to stop my father murdering my mother.

Has weed opened my mind to God?,commonogre,1621090795,"To clarify this is the title I would have had if it wasnt too long:  
Has God opened my mind and hearth to him thru weed?  
Hi, I am a catholic, not yet bapthised. I have read a lot on catholicism and I am entirely conviced by faith and reason that God exists, when I get bapthised I will choose Thomas Aquinas for sure.  
I was born and raised in a protestant sect where they believed literally a man was Jesus and stuff like that, my hearth was really far from God after i separated at 12/13, became an agnosthic and then an atheist, first with hatred towards what God represented, and then with just the unability to understand how can people have faith in God and a struggle to get faith.  
I truly had no possible way to have faith, during my early 20 I tried really hard to believe in anything beyond the physical with no success, it was only me lying to myself. Later on I started reading Thomas Aquinas logical explaination for God, and then Father Mike Schmitz, and then some other youtube content and articles. I was convinced there was logic for a God to exist, but it was only a mere posibility. I smoke weed once every one or two months because it truly helps me think, I started doing it for just the laughs but in the last year it made me think so much and so deep in ways I can not do normally. I saw a ghost after my granma died last year (and I didnt smoke at that time and no where near that time), but I also tought it might have been an illusion, it did open my mind to new posibilities. I tried praying for God to build my faith too, even thought I felt like I was doing a senseless thing.  
But to get to the point, one day I was smoking, thinking at my kitchen and it suddenly made a lot of sense, God was real, God loved me and this was what I firmly believed, it was a snap out to reality, it was truly magical. It made a lot sense in a logical manner, in a way of thinking that I can only formulate when I am high.  
I feel my faith is much greater after every time I smoke (as I said, I dont do it often) , I dont need weed anymore to have faith and it increases everyday, but I assure  you everytime I smoke I am more a believer.  


This is no drug apology I hope, its just an honest question, maybe the weed was not related, but the way I think when im high is much more abstract, I think without thinking on think, its hard to explain, so I applied that with the logic facts that were display by Thomas Aquinas and others and for more or less a year I've been catholic, and I love God, the virgin Mary and the catholic church.",Catholicism

Exclusivity in the church,Informal-Amphibian-4,1621088399,"Whenever exclusivity or playing favorites comes up people like to point out that Jesus had favorites too. I've tried to be open minded and understand this from their point of view, but after pondering this for many years I still believe this fact is taken out of context and is used as a rationalization for natural human inclinations.

Humans aren't perfect. I know. But should that be an excuse to continue a detrimental behavior or to not strive to be better?

Jesus had friends who were closer than others but he was always looking to bring more people into the fold. One reason some people were closer to him was because they were willing to receive and respond to his love. He offers love to all but chooses those who also choose him. Not because he only accepted his few closer friends into the flock and shunned others he didn't ""like"" as much. (Because what do we really know about how God ""likes""? We don't perceive as he does.)

I understand everyone is accepted into the flock in terms of being a part of Mother Church. I've also heard the reasoning that even church groups/communities can be exclusive because ""we can only have community with so many people."" Correct me if I'm wrong, but I find this to be directly contrary to the gospel. We are supposed to and in heaven will be in communion with God as well as all of God's children. We might not be there yet but we should be striving for his kingdom here and now. Jesus had closer friends and we are advised even by saints to have smaller families or communities and closer friends we can turn to for spiritual support. It's impossible for humans to be just as deep or close with everyone but shouldn't we seek to expand our hearts and give away that love freely? God is always looking to expand his love and reach new people. In cases where he does turn someone away, it is for a greater reason.

I'm not saying people shouldn't have closer friends but should we be keeping gatekeeping our ministry groups by only allowing the ""right"" people to become fully involved?",Catholicism

Isaiah 9:2-7 as evidence for Christianity,EthanCBohr,1621070554,"""In the messianic expectation within the Old Testament, there is a sort of mysterious tension. Israel is to have no king but God (Judg 8:22–23; 1 Sam 8:6–7; Isa 33:22; Zech 14:9). This is why, when Israel first enters the promised land, they are ruled not by a king but by judges (Judg 1–21; Ruth 1:1; 2 Sam 7:11), and why the people’s request for a king in the days of Samuel is portrayed in the Bible as sinful and misguided (1 Sam 8–12). And yet, through the subsequent Davidic covenant and its promise of an everlasting Davidic throne (2 Sam 7; Pss 2; 72; 78; 89; 132; Ezek 37:24–25), the coming reign of this human messianic king is given a central role in the divine plan"" (James P. Ware, *Paul Theology in Context*, Eerdmans, 2019, pp. 70). This point of tension is never explicitly resolved in the Old Testament. However, meet Isaiah, an 8th century BCE Jewish prophet who foreshowed the solution to this tension in an oracle he wrote, which is now in Isaiah 9:2-7.

# Isaiah 9:2-7

Isaiah 9:2-7 was an oracle written by Isaiah son of Amoz around 720 BCE, 700 + years before Jesus lived. It reads:

&gt;The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. You have multiplied the nation; you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as they are glad when they divide the spoil. For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian. For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire. *For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor,* *Mighty God* ***(el gibbor)****, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore*. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. (Isaiah 9:2-7: ESV)

This prophecy is a distinct oracle from Isaiah 7, despite the supposed intertextual links (cf. John J. Collins, ""Isaiah 8:23-9:6 And It's Greek Translation,"" in *Scripture in transition: essays on Septuagint, Hebrew Bible, and Dead Sea scrolls in honour of Raija Sollamo*, Brill, 2008, pp. 206). The son in Isaiah 7, Immanuel, does not have the same names that are given to the son in Isaiah 9. See Roberts, J. J. M, and Peter Machinist's *First Isaiah: A Commentary* (Fortress Press, 2015), pp. 150 for further arguments against identifying the son of Isaiah 9 with the son in Isaiah 7. The initial announcement that a child “is born” (*yullad* prophetic perfect verb to bring the reader to look back in time *from Isaiah's future*) is further explained in the parallel phrase, God “will give a son to us,” that is, to the people of Judah. The past tense words are a case of Isaiah writing about the future (the birth of the messiah) as something that has already occurred (cf. J. Alec Motyer, *The Prophecy of Isaiah*, pp. 97).

So this text is indicating that this son will be called God (YHWH) sometime in the future. The prophetic nature of this text is proven by the future tense at the end of Isaiah 9:7, including the reference to the son's birth (""The zeal of the Lord of hosts *will* do this""). Certain scholars, however, posit that the four titles, including ""Mighty God,"" is referring to Hezekiah instead (such as Roberts, J. J. M cited above)!! These scholars point to how names often point to realities beyond the person bearing them. Andrew T. Abernethy and Gregory Goswell write: ""Among these kinds of names are theophoric names (in that they have a divine name in them, usually “el” or “yah”). Eliezer (“God of help”), Elkanah (“God of-grace”), Hezekiah (“YHWH is strong”), Isaiah (“YHWH saves”), Immanuel (“God with us”), and Ishmael (“God is hearing”) are examples of names with a divine element in the names. These names do not claim that the human bearing them is divine; instead, they say something about God. Similarly, it is probable that the names in Isa. 9:6 point to God, not to the essence of the human ruler"" (cf. Andrew T. Abernethy, Gregory Goswell, *God's Messiah in the Old Testament: Expectations of a Coming King,* Baker Academic, 2020). However, what is far more likely is that ""*el gibbor*"" refers to deity, that is, it is saying that the the son that sits on David's throne will be called ""God"" (YHWH). Here are some reasons for this:

1. The description of the child cannot be applied to a merely human king (such as Hezekiah) - a 'God like warrior,"" instead of a deity. The term gibbor (“mighty”) is often used of God (Dt 10:17; Ps 24:8; Jer 20:11; Zph 3:17). Although it can also refer to “warriors” or “heroes” (Ezk 32:21), linking *gibbor* with *el* clearly indicates that Isaiah intended to describe this wondrous child as deity. In fact, wherever the term ‘Mighty God’ (*el gibbor*) is used, *it is used exclusively for YHWH in the Hebrew Bible*. This is clear elsewhere, where no doubt the term refers to YHWH (cf. Deut. 10:17; Jer. 32:18). In fact, Isaiah uses the same exact words for the YHWH Himself in 10:20-21 in the very next chapter! Isaiah 10:21 says: ""a remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the *mighty God""* ***(el gibbor).*** This is pretty good evidence that ""*el gibbor*"" is not a theophoric name, but is calling the person in question YHWH Himself. John Goldingay observes that the recurrence of the phrase rendered ‘Mighty God’ (’el gibbor) in 10:21 with definite reference to Yahweh makes it harder to accept that here the phrase just denotes a theophoric name (cf. John Goldingay, *Isaiah*, New International Biblical Commentary \[Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2001\], pp. 73). Thus, this oracle is saying that the son will be called YHWH.
2. The nature of the unlimited rule promised in verse 7 (""forevermore"") transcends a normal earthly rule (John Oswalt 1986, pp. 246).
3. The chronology is off for the son in Isaiah 9:6 to be Hezekiah. As John J. Collins writes: ""there are notorious chronological problems with this identification. According to 2 Kgs 18:10, the fall of Samaria (722/1 b.c.e.) was in the sixth year of Hezekiah, but according to verse 13 in the same chapter, the campaign of Sennacherib in 701 b.c.e. was in his 14th year.24 Accordingly, his date of accession is variously given as 728/7 or 715 b.c.e. In 2 Kgs 18:1 we are told that he was 25 years old when he came to the throne, and if this is correct he would have been born too early on either date of accession.  But the chronology is confused. According to 2 Kgs 16:1–2, Ahaz was only 20 when he began to reign and he only reigned for 16 years. If Hezekiah were 25 when he succeeded to the throne, he would have been born when his father was 11"" (John J. Collins, ""Isaiah 8:23-9:6 And It's Greek Translation,"" in *Scripture in transition: essays on Septuagint, Hebrew Bible, and Dead Sea scrolls in honour of Raija Sollamo*, Brill, 2008, pp. 208).

Unless Isaiah thought that Hezekiah or some other human figure around his time was his God (YHWH), there is little reason to think that Isaiah was speaking of Hezekiah or any other contemporary king or son of a king here. There is no evidence that Isaiah or his disciples that added material to 'First Isaiah' worshipped any deity but YHWH in his later oracles. Rather, Isaiah was speaking of an ideal future messiah being called YHWH.

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #1: But the NT writers read this prophecy, and shaped Jesus out to look like the son in Isaiah 9**

However, the NT authors never cite Isaiah 9:6-7 as a proof text for the deity of Christ, or, indeed, at all. None of the NT authors, aside from perhaps an unlikely allusion in gJohn, even so much as even allude to it. In addition, despite Isaiah's text, no Jew expected the messiah to be God. However, this all misses the point. The prophecy doesn't explicitly say that the Jewish messiah will *be* God, but rather that he will be *named* or *called* God. And that is true with regards to Jesus for the main thrust of Christianity, from the time the apostles began to preach until today. The mention of the son's ""increase of his government and of peace"" crosses out many examples aside from Jesus, since no other claimed Jewish messiah has had a following that is has steadily increased since it's conception to (now) be a worldwide religion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #2: But Jesus did not have ""the government on his shoulders.""**

The reference to the government being set upon his shoulder just indicates the inauguration of the son's authority in general (cf. Marvin A. Sweeney, *Isaiah 1-39 With An Introduction To Prophetic Literature*, Eerdmans, 1996, pp. 182). This is why some translations render the verse as ""authority on his shoulders"" (e.g., NRSV). I don't see how this contradicts anything. If Jesus is God, he has ""authority on his shoulders."" Joseph Blenkinsopp translates ""הַמִּשְׂרָ֖ה"" as “emblems of sovereignty,”  and suggests that  ""emblems of sovereignty"" ""may point to investiture with a robe or other symbol of authority"" (Joseph Blenkinsopp, *Isaiah 1-39*, pp. 250).

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #3: But Jesus did not supply peace for the throne of David.**

This promise in Isaiah of the son supplying peace *for the throne of David* just implies that no one will be able to successfully oppose the son's authority or undermine the positive effects of his kingdom. The pledge also certifies that the text refers to the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant through a “messianic” figure that will be a peaceful figure, and so supply peace *for the throne*. The somewhat ambiguous phrase in 9:7 should not distract us from the powerful assertions of this future messiah essentially being called YHWH.

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #4: But the earliest Christians never called Jesus God or YHWH, so it is a prophecy unfulfilled**

Paul would beg the differ. Before going into the evidence for this, one must grasp the OT background by which Paul operated in I think. In the OT, there were two expectations. The first one was the expectation of a coming messiah. But the more important expectation was the coming of the reign of YHWH. In this expectation, YHWH would finally dwell among his people in the fullness of his presence and restore all things (Isa 35; 40:1-11; Ps 96; Ezek 37:21-28; 43:1-9; 48:35; Zech 14:1-19; Mal 3:1-5). But what evidence is there to show that Paul thought that Jesus fulfilled the expectation of the coming of YHWH? Here are some reasons:

1. **1 Corinthians 8:4-6:** Paul’s language here the Shema, found in Deuteronomy 6:4: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord!” This confession employs both the divine title “God” and the divine name “the Lord” to affirm that YHWH, the Lord, is the one and only God. As Ware writes: ""within this ancient Jewish context, Paul’s use of this confession is explosive. In echoing Deuteronomy 6:4, Paul ascribes the divine title to “the Father” (“one God, the Father”) and the sacred divine name to “Jesus Christ” (“one Lord, Jesus Christ”). *Not only in Deuteronomy 6:4 but also in every Jewish text known to us from antiquity, the phrase “one Lord” refers without exception to the one God of Israel.* *But Paul here identifies the “one Lord” as Jesus Christ* \[cf. Erik Waaler 2008\]. Paul’s confession identifies the unique and incomparable “one God, one Lord” of Israel’s central affirmation as the Father, and his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. And the words Paul adds to this confession of Jesus as the one Lord—“through whom are all things”—are in the Bible and elsewhere in ancient Jewish literature used always and only of God as creator (cf. Rom 11:36, “from him and through him and to him are all things”). Paul in 1 Corinthians 8:6 affirms these words of the one Lord, Jesus Christ (“one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things”)"" (Ware 2019: 73-4).
2. **Romans 9:4-5:** First of all, the most natural reading is to take the participial clause as dependent on what precedes and as adjectivally modifying *ho Christos*. Second, moreover, Paul's benediction clauses of this sort are always synthetic and grammatically dependent on the preceding clause. Romans 1:25 is an example. As Carraway shows in his book *Christ is God Over All: Romans 9:5 in the context of Romans 9-11* (Bloomsbury, 2013), if Romans 9:5 were in fact grammatically independent of what precedes, this would be the only example in Paul and out of step with his usage elsewhere. This point alone establishes the likelihood of the divine identification. Third, as Ware points out in *Paul's Theology in Context*, Paul's use of the delimiting *to kata sarka* in the preceding clause moves this argument from likelihood to certainty. On *to kata sarka*, see the standard grammars, Robertson, Blass, and Kuehner/Gerth on the syntactic function of the article in such phrases. So Paul calls Jesus ""God"" (Θεὸς) here it seems like.
3. **The Day of Christ:** In 1 Thessalonians 3:13, Paul’s note of “the coming of the Lord Jesus with all his holy ones” is drawing from Zechariah 14:5: “Then the Lord my God will come, and all his holy ones with him!” Ware writes: ""in Zechariah 14:5, the Lord who comes is YHWH, my God; in 1 Thessalonians 3:13, the Lord who comes is the Lord Jesus. Paul identifies Jesus as YHWH in the flesh, and Jesus’s coming again in glory as the final fulfillment of the hope of YHWH’s coming. And here we find once again Jesus’s fusion of the two great streams of expectation in his own person, for in Paul’s theology the Old Testament expectation of “*the day of the Lord*” (Isa 2:10–21; Amos 5:18–20; Zeph 1:14–18) has become the hope of “*the day of Christ*” (Phil 1:6, 10; 2:16) and “*the day of the* *Lord Jesus*” (1 Cor 1:8; 2 Cor 1:14)"" (Ware 2019: 82).

There are far more passages in Paul's letters that indicate this. So in the earliest Christina literature, Jesus is considered YHWH in the flesh. In addition, the Gospel of Mark has supernatural beings that worship Jesus, which is inconceivable if Jesus is not considered God in Mark/ Besides, as Bauckham points out:

&gt;If Mark deliberately avoided reproducing Isaiah’s “our God” in Mark 1:3, it was not because he attributed less-than-full divinity to Jesus, but because he followed a common early Christian terminological practice, in which the word God was only rarely applied to Jesus. By calling Jesus κύριος in contexts where the word was recognized as a substitute for the divine name, early Christians indicated clearly that Jesus shared the divine identity of God his Father. But they did not want to say that Jesus was simply identical with God his Father. The word God could all-too-easily imply either that or that Jesus was a subordinate god. By substituting “his” for “our God” in his citation of Isa 40:3, Mark was actually ruling out a possible reading of that verse that would distinguish “the Lord” and “our God” as two divinities.

(Bauckham, “Markan Christology according to Richard Hays: Some Addenda”, *JTI* \[2017\], pp. 24-25)

**Conclusion:**

As we saw at the beginning, in the Old Testament, there is a mysterious tension between God as the only king of Israel and the central place of the human messianic king in the divine plan. Israel was to have no king but God. This mystery was resolved, in a wonderful and unexpected way, by Jesus’s uniting of both streams of expectation in his own person, the expectation of the coming of the messiah, and the expectation of the coming of YHWH (Isa 35; 40:1-11; Ps 96; Ezek 37:21-28; 43:1-9; 48:35; Zech 14:1-19; Mal 3:1-5). The messianic king is YHWH Himself, the king of Israel, and Isaiah seems to foreshadow this by him  prophesying that this son will be called YHWH.

In addition, Isaiah prophecies that the kingdom of this son will grow ""continually,"" meaning that it will grow from the time of it's conception, ""forevermore."" This means that the few examples of persons who have been called God by certain Jewish people (e.g., Rebbe, otherwise known as ""Menachem Mendel Schneerson"") don't seem to apply, especially in light of the worldwide spread of the messiah's kingdom in Isaiah's oracles.",Catholicism

Jesus is God! Isaiah 9:2-7 as Evidence for Christianity,EthanCBohr,1621068764,"""In the messianic expectation within the Old Testament, there is a sort of mysterious tension. Israel is to have no king but God (Judg 8:22–23; 1 Sam 8:6–7; Isa 33:22; Zech 14:9). This is why, when Israel first enters the promised land, they are ruled not by a king but by judges (Judg 1–21; Ruth 1:1; 2 Sam 7:11), and why the people’s request for a king in the days of Samuel is portrayed in the Bible as sinful and misguided (1 Sam 8–12). And yet, through the subsequent Davidic covenant and its promise of an everlasting Davidic throne (2 Sam 7; Pss 2; 72; 78; 89; 132; Ezek 37:24–25), the coming reign of this human messianic king is given a central role in the divine plan"" (James P. Ware, *Paul Theology in Context*, Eerdmans, 2019, pp. 70). This point of tension is never explicitly resolved in the Old Testament. However, meet Isaiah, an 8th century BCE Jewish prophet who foreshowed the solution to this tension in an oracle he wrote, which is now in Isaiah 9:2-7.

# Isaiah 9:2-7

Isaiah 9:2-7 was an oracle written by Isaiah son of Amoz around 720 BCE, 700 + years before Jesus lived. It reads:

&gt;The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. You have multiplied the nation; you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as they are glad when they divide the spoil. For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian. For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire. *For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor,* *Mighty God* ***(el gibbor)****, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore*. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. (Isaiah 9:2-7: ESV)

This prophecy is a distinct oracle from Isaiah 7, despite the supposed intertextual links (cf. John J. Collins, ""Isaiah 8:23-9:6 And It's Greek Translation,"" in *Scripture in transition: essays on Septuagint, Hebrew Bible, and Dead Sea scrolls in honour of Raija Sollamo*, Brill, 2008, pp. 206). The son in Isaiah 7, Immanuel, does not have the same names that are given to the son in Isaiah 9. See Roberts, J. J. M, and Peter Machinist's *First Isaiah: A Commentary* (Fortress Press, 2015), pp. 150 for further arguments against identifying the son of Isaiah 9 with the son in Isaiah 7. The initial announcement that a child “is born” (*yullad* prophetic perfect verb to bring the reader to look back in time *from Isaiah's future*) is further explained in the parallel phrase, God “will give a son to us,” that is, to the people of Judah. The past tense words are a case of Isaiah writing about the future (the birth of the messiah) as something that has already occurred (cf. J. Alec Motyer, *The Prophecy of Isaiah*, pp. 97).

So this text is indicating that this son will be called God (YHWH) sometime in the future. The prophetic nature of this text is proven by the future tense at the end of Isaiah 9:7, including the reference to the son's birth (""The zeal of the Lord of hosts *will* do this""). Certain scholars, however, posit that the four titles, including ""Mighty God,"" is referring to Hezekiah instead (such as Roberts, J. J. M cited above)!! These scholars point to how names often point to realities beyond the person bearing them. Andrew T. Abernethy and Gregory Goswell write: ""Among these kinds of names are theophoric names (in that they have a divine name in them, usually “el” or “yah”). Eliezer (“God of help”), Elkanah (“God of-grace”), Hezekiah (“YHWH is strong”), Isaiah (“YHWH saves”), Immanuel (“God with us”), and Ishmael (“God is hearing”) are examples of names with a divine element in the names. These names do not claim that the human bearing them is divine; instead, they say something about God. Similarly, it is probable that the names in Isa. 9:6 point to God, not to the essence of the human ruler"" (cf. Andrew T. Abernethy, Gregory Goswell, *God's Messiah in the Old Testament: Expectations of a Coming King,* Baker Academic, 2020). However, what is far more likely is that ""*el gibbor*"" refers to deity, that is, it is saying that the the son that sits on David's throne will be called ""God"" (YHWH). Here are some reasons for this:

1. The description of the child cannot be applied to a merely human king (such as Hezekiah) - a 'God like warrior,"" instead of a deity. The term gibbor (“mighty”) is often used of God (Dt 10:17; Ps 24:8; Jer 20:11; Zph 3:17). Although it can also refer to “warriors” or “heroes” (Ezk 32:21), linking *gibbor* with *el* clearly indicates that Isaiah intended to describe this wondrous child as deity. In fact, wherever the term ‘Mighty God’ (*el gibbor*) is used, *it is used exclusively for YHWH in the Hebrew Bible*. This is clear elsewhere, where no doubt the term refers to YHWH (cf. Deut. 10:17; Jer. 32:18). In fact, Isaiah uses the same exact words for the YHWH Himself in 10:20-21 in the very next chapter! Isaiah 10:21 says: ""a remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the *mighty God""* ***(el gibbor).*** This is pretty good evidence that ""*el gibbor*"" is not a theophoric name, but is calling the person in question YHWH Himself. John Goldingay observes that the recurrence of the phrase rendered ‘Mighty God’ (’el gibbor) in 10:21 with definite reference to Yahweh makes it harder to accept that here the phrase just denotes a theophoric name (cf. John Goldingay, *Isaiah*, New International Biblical Commentary \[Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2001\], pp. 73). Thus, this oracle is saying that the son will be called YHWH.
2. The nature of the unlimited rule promised in verse 7 (""forevermore"") transcends a normal earthly rule (John Oswalt 1986, pp. 246).
3. The chronology is off for the son in Isaiah 9:6 to be Hezekiah. As John J. Collins writes: ""there are notorious chronological problems with this identification. According to 2 Kgs 18:10, the fall of Samaria (722/1 b.c.e.) was in the sixth year of Hezekiah, but according to verse 13 in the same chapter, the campaign of Sennacherib in 701 b.c.e. was in his 14th year.24 Accordingly, his date of accession is variously given as 728/7 or 715 b.c.e. In 2 Kgs 18:1 we are told that he was 25 years old when he came to the throne, and if this is correct he would have been born too early on either date of accession.  But the chronology is confused. According to 2 Kgs 16:1–2, Ahaz was only 20 when he began to reign and he only reigned for 16 years. If Hezekiah were 25 when he succeeded to the throne, he would have been born when his father was 11"" (John J. Collins,  Isaiah 8:23-9:6 And It's Greek Translation,"" in *Scripture in transition: essays on Septuagint, Hebrew Bible, and Dead Sea scrolls in honour of Raija Sollamo*, Brill, 2008, pp. 208).

Unless Isaiah thought that Hezekiah or some other human figure around his time was his God (YHWH), there is little reason to think that Isaiah was speaking of Hezekiah or any other contemporary king or son of a king here. There is no evidence that Isaiah or his disciples that added material to 'First Isaiah' worshipped any deity but YHWH in his later oracles. Rather, Isaiah was speaking of an ideal future messiah being called YHWH.

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #1: But the NT writers read this prophecy, and shaped Jesus out to look like the son in Isaiah 9**

However, the NT authors never cite Isaiah 9:6-7 as a proof text for the deity of Christ, or, indeed, at all. None of the NT authors, aside from perhaps an unlikely allusion in gJohn, even so much as even allude to it. In addition, despite Isaiah's text, no Jew expected the messiah to be God. However, this all misses the point. The prophecy doesn't explicitly say that the Jewish messiah will *be* God, but rather that he will be *named* or *called* God. And that is true with regards to Jesus for the main thrust of Christianity, from the time the apostles began to preach until today. The mention of the son's ""increase of his government and of peace"" crosses out many examples aside from Jesus, since no other claimed Jewish messiah has had a following that is has steadily increased since it's conception to (now) be a worldwide religion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #2: But Jesus did not have ""the government on his shoulders.""**

The reference to the government being set upon his shoulder just indicates the inauguration of the son's authority in general (cf. Marvin A. Sweeney, *Isaiah 1-39 With An Introduction To Prophetic Literature*, Eerdmans, 1996, pp. 182). This is why some translations render the verse as ""authority on his shoulders"" (e.g., NRSV). I don't see how this contradicts anything. If Jesus is God, he has ""authority on his shoulders."" Joseph Blenkinsopp translates ""הַמִּשְׂרָ֖ה"" as “emblems of sovereignty,”  and suggests that  ""emblems of sovereignty"" ""may point to investiture with a robe or other symbol of authority"" (Joseph Blenkinsopp, *Isaiah 1-39*, pp. 250).

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #3: But Jesus did not supply peace for the throne of David.**

This promise in Isaiah of the son supplying peace *for the throne of David* just implies that no one will be able to successfully oppose the son's authority or undermine the positive effects of his kingdom. The pledge also certifies that the text refers to the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant through a “messianic” figure that will be a peaceful figure, and so supply peace *for the throne*. The somewhat ambiguous phrase in 9:7 should not distract us from the powerful assertions of this future messiah essentially being called YHWH.

&amp;#x200B;

**Objection #4: But the earliest Christians never called Jesus God or YHWH, so it is a prophecy unfulfilled**

Paul would beg the differ. Before going into the evidence for this, one must grasp the OT background by which Paul operated in I think. In the OT, there were two expectations. The first one was the expectation of a coming messiah. But the more important expectation was the coming of the reign of YHWH. In this expectation, YHWH would finally dwell among his people in the fullness of his presence and restore all things (Isa 35; 40:1-11; Ps 96; Ezek 37:21-28; 43:1-9; 48:35; Zech 14:1-19; Mal 3:1-5). But what evidence is there to show that Paul thought that Jesus fulfilled the expectation of the coming of YHWH? Here are some reasons:

1. **1 Corinthians 8:4-6:** Paul’s language here the Shema, found in Deuteronomy 6:4: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord!” This confession employs both the divine title “God” and the divine name “the Lord” to affirm that YHWH, the Lord, is the one and only God. As Ware writes: ""within this ancient Jewish context, Paul’s use of this confession is explosive. In echoing Deuteronomy 6:4, Paul ascribes the divine title to “the Father” (“one God, the Father”) and the sacred divine name to “Jesus Christ” (“one Lord, Jesus Christ”). *Not only in Deuteronomy 6:4 but also in every Jewish text known to us from antiquity, the phrase “one Lord” refers without exception to the one God of Israel.* *But Paul here identifies the “one Lord” as Jesus Christ* \[cf. Erik Waaler 2008\]. Paul’s confession identifies the unique and incomparable “one God, one Lord” of Israel’s central affirmation as the Father, and his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. And the words Paul adds to this confession of Jesus as the one Lord—“through whom are all things”—are in the Bible and elsewhere in ancient Jewish literature used always and only of God as creator (cf. Rom 11:36, “from him and through him and to him are all things”). Paul in 1 Corinthians 8:6 affirms these words of the one Lord, Jesus Christ (“one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things”)"" (Ware 2019: 73-4).
2. **Romans 9:4-5:** First of all, the most natural reading is to take the participial clause as dependent on what precedes and as adjectivally modifying *ho Christos*. Second, moreover, Paul's benediction clauses of this sort are always synthetic and grammatically dependent on the preceding clause. Romans 1:25 is an example. As Carraway shows in his book *Christ is God Over All: Romans 9:5 in the context of Romans 9-11* (Bloomsbury, 2013), if Romans 9:5 were in fact grammatically independent of what precedes, this would be the only example in Paul and out of step with his usage elsewhere. This point alone establishes the likelihood of the divine identification. Third, as Ware points out in *Paul's Theology in Context*, Paul's use of the delimiting *to kata sarka* in the preceding clause moves this argument from likelihood to certainty. On *to kata sarka*, see the standard grammars, Robertson, Blass, and Kuehner/Gerth on the syntactic function of the article in such phrases. So Paul calls Jesus ""God"" (Θεὸς) here it seems like.
3. **The Day of Christ:** In 1 Thessalonians 3:13, Paul’s note of “the coming of the Lord Jesus with all his holy ones” is drawing from Zechariah 14:5: “Then the Lord my God will come, and all his holy ones with him!” Ware writes: ""in Zechariah 14:5, the Lord who comes is YHWH, my God; in 1 Thessalonians 3:13, the Lord who comes is the Lord Jesus. Paul identifies Jesus as YHWH in the flesh, and Jesus’s coming again in glory as the final fulfillment of the hope of YHWH’s coming. And here we find once again Jesus’s fusion of the two great streams of expectation in his own person, for in Paul’s theology the Old Testament expectation of “*the day of the Lord*” (Isa 2:10–21; Amos 5:18–20; Zeph 1:14–18) has become the hope of “*the day of Christ*” (Phil 1:6, 10; 2:16) and “*the day of the* *Lord Jesus*” (1 Cor 1:8; 2 Cor 1:14)"" (Ware 2019: 82).

There are far more passages in Paul's letters that indicate this. So in the earliest Christina literature, Jesus is considered YHWH in the flesh. In addition, the Gospel of Mark has supernatural beings that worship Jesus, which is inconceivable if Jesus is not considered God in Mark/ Besides, as Bauckham points out:

Evidence that William Shakespeare was a Crypto-Catholic,TJB74,1621066621,"Born in England at a time of great religious turmoil.  The historian Eammon Duffy, in his work *The Stripping of the Altars*, points out that the Roman Catholicism was in lively health prior to the English Reformation. This challenged the prevailing belief that it was a decaying force, theologically spent and unable to provide sufficient spiritual sustenance for the population at large. Duffy argues that this is not so, taking a broad range of evidence (accounts, wills, memoirs, rood screens, stained glass, joke-books, graffiti, etc.) demonstrating that every aspect of religious life prior to the Reformation was undertaken with well-meaning piety.   Recusancy laws outlawed any service not found in the Book of Common Prayer. Things seems so volatile, that in Shakespeare's lifetime there was widespread quiet resistance to the newly imposed reforms. 

Shakespeare’s family lived at this time of an accelerated implementation of Protestantism and quiet resistance. Outwardly, they were conforming members of the Church of England. Mary Arden, Shakespeare’s mother, was from a conspicuous and determinedly Catholic family in Warwickshire. His father John Shakespeare was a glove maker and wool dealer, a successful small businessman and they lived in a large house in Henley St, that was divided in two parts to allow him to carry out his business from the same premises. It was important to him to conform to the prevailing tides, and as an upstanding local craftsman, he was elected to several municipal offices, which required being a church member in good standing. At one point acting as town chamberlain, he was required to remove ""all signs of superstition and idolatry from places of worship"", and covered over the wall-paintings of the Chapel of the Guild of the Holy Cross. However, a tract, apparently signed by John Shakespeare, in which he pledged to remain a Catholic in his heart, was found in the 18th century in the rafters of his home.  This has since been lost, but the reported wording of the tract is linked to a testament written by Charles Borromeo (Catholic Archbishop of Milan) and circulated in England by the Jesuit priest Edmund Campion. 

 Historians talk about the period (1585–1592), when Shakespeare was between 21 and 28 years old as his ""lost years"". However, a will that was unearthed in 1851 shows that a *Will Shakeshafte*, on the recommendation of a John Cottam, was acting as a schoolmaster for a Catholic family in Houghton Tower, Lancashire. Cottam is said to have been Shakespeare’s last schoolmaster in Stratford-upon-Avon. It was also a base for Edmund Campion, a Jesuit priest famous in England at the time who was executed and revered as a martyr by Catholics. It is thought that Campions library of books was recovered from Hoghton Tower after his execution and that Alexander Hoghton left money in his will to a certain ""William Shakeshafte"",  Richard Wilson a professor of Shakespeare Studies at Kingston University, published the theory of the lost Catholic years in Lancashire in the Times Literary Supplement in 1997, shaping a theory that had been first proposed in 1937 by Oliver Baker, and restated in 1944 by E. K. Chambers and later by Ernst Honigmann in a book ‘Lost Years’.

A Lutheran confesses that a sinner is justified by faith receiving Christ's merit/atonement for sin. 'Justification' then, is a forensic (courtroom) declaration of innocence from our actual sins and our original sin (concupisence) because those were laid upon Christ who atoned for them by the shedding of His blood. It's like a courtroom; God is the judge (Ro. 8:33). Satan (rightfully) accuses us of being horrible sinners. Christ is our lawyer/advocate (1 John 2) whereby He holds His merit before God, gives it to us (imputation), and we in turn are pronounced just by God the judge. It's a daily thing (Lutherans don't believe that we are 'justified' once and then that's it, but that we are daily in need of God's declaration of innocence). 'Sanctification' is the progressive, ongoing conformity to Christ's image, which is synergistic (by God's grace AND human cooperation), whereas justification is solely on account of Christ's merits -- our faith is receptive and not active in our salvation.

Account age and karma requirements for participation,you_know_what_you,1621052784,"r/Catholicism has instituted a new requirement for participation. Only user accounts over a certain age and [karma](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511829-What-is-karma-) (Reddit's contribution scoring method) are allowed to contribute.

This goes for posts and comments. 

##### What happens when users post or comment and their accounts don't meet the age and karma thresholds?

If it is a *post,* it is removed and Automoderator makes a comment informing them of the reason, pointing to this post elaborating the rule. If it is a *comment,* the comment is removed, and a similar note is posted as a reply.

##### Why are we making this change?

Recognizing that there are worthwhile uses of new accounts and throwaways to contribute here, we have determined that allowing this time-honored behavior is not worth the corresponding trouble bad-faith actors and trolls wreak in our subreddit with its negligible 'cost of entry'. For now, we have determined that the upsides do not outweigh the downsides.

##### What exactly are the age and karma thresholds for participating?

This is something we will not make public for a few reasons, including our desire to be able to tweak the thresholds and restrictions as we feel the need.

##### I have an urgent problem and/or I need an exception. What do I do?

Again, we appreciate this will impact new-to-Reddit contributors, along with people desiring a bit more anonymity. For the time being, we can only offer the advice to reconsider using a throwaway account to satisfy your need, or continue using Reddit elsewhere with your new account before contributing here.

"Other Catholics are hurting my faith in God and the Church, what do I do?",LoveByCandlelight,1621043635,"

I don’t know who to talk to besides my parish priest, but they don’t do appointments. I’m not writing this with the intention to complain, but to get something very painful off my chest. 

There are certain types of Catholics that are hurting my faith. I think you may be able to relate to me when I say this, these types that are very into philosophy and ignore the person behind the screen. They will quote Biblical texts and ignore the nuances of what you’re going through. This type of person, when you tell them you’re suicidal, will read your post that said you wanted to die and will comment a doctrinal error you committed, completely ignoring that you said you were having thoughts of death. Correcting errors is important but...there’s a time and place. 

I’m not sure what it is, but I’m hurting pretty deep inside. I don’t feel like I am comfortable expressing my inner emotions and feelings to some people Catholics. It hurts me to explain I’m having, for example, a crisis of faith and that I am struggling to love God, and to downvoted because I lack faith...it’s not like I want to lack faith, I’m just struggling right now because I’m currently in a lot of emotional pain.

There are tons and tons of Catholics out there that are nice, wholesome, humanitarian, and welcoming. It’s just this small but vocal niche online that are like this, and it is hard to navigate an emotional health - faith discussion when people like this participate.

I want to forgive the people that did this, and my emotional state is bringing up this again, but it’s really holding me back.",Catholicism

My Religious Conflict,SchazkDragonborn,1621033786,"I've been considering religion. It brings me comfort and the community is generally decent. 

My problem is all my trauma, and it makes me not want to go back. I'm currently an atheist, and I have lots of trauma from my childhood over me being a queer woman.
I was told in was dirty, unclean, sinful, perverted, unnatural and wrong, starting at the age of 7.

The thought of someone watching over me is relieving, until I remember that they never intervened when I was raped, assaulted and verbally harrassed by my peers. 

I know gods not supposed to give anyone more than they can handle, but I have multiple friends who've killed themselves, because there was too much on their plate, and theres been multiple times where I almost joined their ranks.

Honestly I have too much going on. I've reached out over all my years of living, and I've felt nothing. No spirits, no warmth, no love from a higher being. 

If this is his plan for me, I want to end it now.

I cant go into churches without remembering the sneers and frowns, and I cant say a prayer without being filled with rage, because I'm never answered, even when my life depends on it.

I'm tired of living like he might be there. I'm tired of feeding the small flame in my heart that tells me to just wait a little longer, to hold on and he'll come.

"Understanding ""continued"" discernment of marriage vocation after getting engaged",Spinnak3r,1621032693,"I proposed to my girlfriend back in March and she said yes. She also said we should continue discerning marriage for a couple months but that she wants to have ""completed"" that discernment by June.

I guess I'm not fully understanding what discernment looks like in this context. I mean, I understand that religious discern their vocation for several years after entering a monastery or convent before taking their final vows, but given the shorter timetable we are on as an engaged couple I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to be looking for.

Maybe part of this has to do with my being a convert? Even though I've been at this for four years maybe there are some things we do that I don't know or understand yet? I tried explaining this to my protestant parents and they, like me, think that when we got engaged we should've already known the answer to these things.

The thing of it is, I did then and I do now. And I know she does too because she told me before we got engaged that she wanted her yes to mean yes—so she took a lot of time to think carefully about it before letting me know she was ready for that next step.

Can someone help me out here? What does it look like to continue discerning in this phase? Are we basically just waiting to see if God tells us we *shouldn't* get married?

We've already set a date for this fall, and we're signed up for PreCana (and will be signing up for Engaged Encounter here soon), so we're going through with some of those steps, but she didn't want to begin planning the actual wedding until we'd fully discerned this.

It's been almost two months so far and I don't feel like anything's changed for me. I still feel like God brought us together, he kept us together, and he's guiding us towards marriage—all despite some extraordinary circumstances. So in my mind there's nothing left to figure out as far as this goes.

But I don't know, I fully expect that I'm not understanding this and am in need of correction...

Thanks for your help.",Catholicism

It lets us reflect on the absurdity of life. Even the Bible has humorous parts. Like Jonah for example, he basically says he wants to die because a plant that was giving him shade was eaten by a worm. God responds back by asking him if he has any right to feel that way.

The nurse was doing the standard developmental questions and then started slipping in questions about me and my relationship with my spouse and habits. 

For context, my biggest fear is my child being taken from me, I’ve had this since I was pregnant…For false accusations or because of religious beliefs- I know it seems like paranoia but there have been so many instances of authorities overreacting and taking children, or opening CPS files for really nothing, I’ve seen it firsthand professionally and happen to others I know (who are good parents!) personally.

Anyways, my spouse and I are separated (because he was abusive in front of the child) but I never mention any of that because it’s none of their business, but they started asking questions about conflict resolution with them and tension and alcohol/drug habits…As if anyone with things like this going on ever does tell the truth.

So I told them things that aren’t true because I am scared of the consequences. I didn’t feel like I had the option to decline to answer because frankly, they didn’t tell me I had a choice. 

I hate this because it happens every child check-up and I’ve heard all lies are mortal and others say well…there’s some wiggle room.

"I'm not Catholic, but my wife is, and we want our child baptized",BlockbusterChamp,1621018140,"So full disclosure, I'm not religious at all. I was baptized when I was younger (I believe in the Catholic tradition) but I'm confident I didn't go any further in the process. My mom simply stated that caring for my special needs older sister and a set of twin boys (myself and my brother) made going to church too much trouble, but she was very much raised Catholic, going to Catholic school her entire youth. My dad was Protestant but he's hardly religious and I imagine his family went to church a few times a year at best. She made the attempt when I was a teenager to get me to watch ""Charleton Heston teaches the bible"" but good luck getting a rebellious teen to watch anything a parent wants them to.

My wife is Catholic and fully confirmed. She's not an active church attendee but she's very adamant about raising our children Catholic and eventually be confirmed. We recently had a baby boy who's just turned 3 months old. I'm not religious and she's well aware of it, but I'm not opposed to baptism and the process.... but I'm also very much of the mindset to respect my child's wish to actively choose whether or not he wants to pursue being a Catholic or attend church. He's obviously not of that age yet but I'm okay with the baptism being done in the near future as opposed to past the age of seven.

My wife had agreed to get married outside of a Catholic church because I'm just not interested in becoming a Catholic in my 30's. It also made the planning simpler by having the ceremony and reception in one venue.

Not getting married in a church didn't seem to change the issue of me needing to go through the entire process of being confirmed or attending a congregation and declaring myself Catholic. This is what I'm being told by my wife.

So what I'm here to try to learn is, is there anything in Catholic guidelines to let me circumnavigate this long process of classes (up to a year I'm told)? I've never been religious, wasn't raised in the church either and at 35 I doubt I'm suddenly going to change without some major life event causing me to find Jesus. I do not mean to offend anyone at all.... but it's just not in the cards. I question far too many things to have a faith.

It would be very disingenuous of me to try to fake it through the classes, and I don't want to waste the church's time while still trying to meet my wife's wishes. I know this sounds selfish but what do other couples do in this situation? I imagine my situation would be more sympathetic if I was of another religion and being asked to convert or assume another tradition might be in conflict with that, but I'm just being told I'm just lazy or selfish because I don't want to go through this process because I'm not a true believer.",Catholicism

Cole is a really good and subtle representation of a pro-life perspective coming from outside a religious setting.,MisterCCL,1621017248,"This song 'Lost Ones' by rapper J. Cole is about a couple who has gotten pregnant unexpectedly and is considering getting an abortion, and Cole portrays both the man and the woman. The song is emotionally heavy, and in my honest opinion, it is an incredible representation of the dialogue that goes on in the current culture about this topic, and acknowledges the weight of the subject, while also showing the common reasons why someone would consider getting an abortion. In a really subtle way, it seems to promote a pro-life position, and it's among the best representations of this position that I have seen come from a non-religious POV.  I discovered this song before I came to that faith, and it was one of the first things that made me think about abortion pretty hard.

I don't know what y'all's opinions of rap music are here. I personally am a fan, and J. Cole is very lyrical and an incredibly good story teller. I don't know about his personal religiosity (that's between him and God), but I do know that he went to St. John's University in NYC, which is a Catholic school, and that he puts religious themes in his songs from time to time. 

Like I said, the song is very emotional and sad, but it's quite beautiful and I think it's worth checking out.

**CW: The song does contain a lot of profanity. IMO, it adds to the emotional weight of the song, but I know some people don't like that kind of language so be warned.**

Explaining interfaith relationship to children,DN_Heese,1621017164,"Interfaith marriages happen now more than ever before. You might not recommend it, but people love who they want to love.

Difference between Lutheran and Catholic ideas of predestination?,synfvl,1621015132,"Hi there, I hope you are all well. I know this might seem like a bit of a niche/strange question (and I hope its okay to ask this in this sub!) but I am writing an essay on different ideologies surrounding predestination in the early modern period and, for all the research I have done, it appears that one of the things Luther did not disagree with the Catholic church on was predestination? Unlike Calvin, Luther also maintained the idea of single predestination and that you would only be ""damned"" if you wilfully rejected God's grace.

"[free friday] i wrote a short story about my faith, death, and my family. i would like to share it with you",window_recital,1621012627,"**ecclesiastes three**

My cat died from an injection in the veterinarian’s office. He hadn’t eaten for days or made a sound. They put the needle in his leg and he reflexively turned out the watery dregs of his digestive system. He died with his tongue out and they wrapped him in a blanket.

When my grandfather died I was alive, but I wasn’t aware. They tell me that I met him once, but he was already in his nineties and I was a toddler. In the closet I found a picture of myself in his arms before he died. But I was crying and he had red eyes from the camera. I don’t think that made him look worse. I can only imagine that his skin was papery at that point from the alcohol and the years of anger. I don’t see any of him in my father. I haven’t in years. I’d like to imagine that after he died my father stopped acting like him. Now I only ever hear about my grandfather in his stories. I see him in a picture in the hall when he was young and chiseled. He has hair like mine. 

By the time he died, his wife had been gone for years. She took a walk and dropped something. I don’t remember what. I just know that it was the reaching for it that took her. She was young and pious and she died in the street under a car. Before she went out walking she’d left a bible on a table. I can see it on the doily, half in shade, half in the half-light of the westward window. The leather must have still held the scent of her hands: the laundry weathered cloth hands of a Mexican housewife. There was a bookmark in the bible. My father says there was. Ecclesiastes three. 

There is a time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to uproot. A time to kill and a time to heal. 

There is a time for everything 

There is a time where my father is sitting in the cabin of a truck. And in this time he is a boy and his knees are raw from falling on the cobbled streets of his town. And maybe he’s scared. Because his father, my grandfather, is a few meters away in the bar and he’s drinking. He’s drinking and he’s turning himself yellow and vomiting and when he’s hit with the delirium tremens, when his eyes are dead and white like a crow and he’s in a hospital bed he’ll promise to everyone this is the last time. And my father is waiting for his father’s voice to approach him in the night, for him to open the driver’s side door of the truck and for him to be sober enough to drive him home. 

A time to search and a time to give up.

A time to tear and a time to mend.

There is a time when my paternal grandmother, my father’s mother, prays her rosary in the dark. One foot on a moonlit floorboard, and her ankles crossed. Like my father does in the morning. 

A time to be silent and a time to speak.

A time to love and a time to hate.

And a time when my grandfather is a bracero. In Salinas California with a sweat stiffened collar and a quivering lip. When he’s turned out of a bar. No dogs, no Mexicans allowed. He’s tearing his throat with obscenities on the bench outside, drinking alone in the dark. He’ll leave for home within a year. With his boots worn to the soles and his face a notch tougher, and he’ll take with him: baseball and big band music. My father will try peanut butter and not be able to open his mouth, and his father will scoff at him and call him an idiot. It will be a fond memory. 

A time to embrace and a time to refrain.

A time to mourn and a time to dance.

There is a time for everything.",Catholicism

Would this be a mortal sin?,johnnyz98,1621011662,"Two days ago, I dealt out a beating on one of the male slaves that I own. I felt a little bad, but being familiar with the book of Exodus, I knew that such treatment is appropriate for slaves.

Exodus 21:20-21: ""Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.""

While this seems pretty clear, I juuuuust passed the two day mark since the beating. My slave has not been able to work or even get up since then. I am worried that if he dies, will God consider his death a direct result of the beating? Or was the beating okay since it has already been longer than two days?

I'm not interested in articles that just want to rant about ""The Pre-Vatican II Church had their Mitered Heads up their Hierarchical Behinds"" or ""The Post-Vatican II Church is a Modernist Mess Making Milkshakes with Marxists.""

📿🏋️‍♀️ Rosary Workout? Beauty And Fitness As Catholics? I Have Lots of Questions...,pursuingholiness,1621009233,"Does anyone do a rosary workout?

I saw some [videos](https://youtu.be/JaYQHe4yYJA) on it and got inspired, but I don't think I'll be doing the exact workout routines as the woman in the video.

I'm trying to get back into fitness after taking a break. I listened to a podcast with Fr. Mike Schmitz awhile back, and he was saying how God loves our bodies just as they are, and we don't need to work for some ""ideal"" body or standard of beauty because God likes the way He made us.

That was a really eye-opening talk, for me. Before, I was obsessed with getting the perfect body and looking like a fitness model because I wanted to give the Holy Spirit a nice dwelling place. I saw all this as an act of worship, and called it ""temple renovation"". I thought about how beautiful and magnificent the Holy Temple was and all the sacred things inside of it, and I thought He, being God; deserved a worthy dwelling like that in my own body. 

But since hearing that God already likes my body just as it is, I was like, ""Aww, how sweet 😊❤️ I guess I don't have to workout anymore."" 

I let myself get fat, then lost all the weight from fasting during Lent (about 15 lbs), and now I want to start working out again. I'm weak and don't have a lot of energy, and I'm not as strong as I used to be :/ Since I've made a habit of saying the rosary everyday or almost every day, I thought doing rosary workouts could be an easy way to get started working out again. 

But I have some questions: 

How should we view exercise as Catholics? I want to get stronger and healthier, but I still want to give my gift to the Holy Spirit. I acknowledge that God likes my body already, but I still want to make it look nicer for Him. Is that wrong? He would be content to live in a lowly shack, but does that mean I shouldn't make Him a palace? 

Also, how does this apply to caring for one's body in general? Since meditating on the Imago Dei, I've been so excited about the fact that God gave me a body and made me in His image. I thought I should do everything I can to take care of this body and show I appreciate it. Like, if I give someone a gift and I see that they aren't using it or are letting it go to shambles, I feel like they don't think that highly about the gift I gave. (ex: I give someone a car, and they don't drive it, or they let it sit out and rust; or fill it up with trash.). I wanted to show gratitude for this amazing gift by taking care of my hair, skin, and nails. I feel that this can all cross over into vanity though :/ I dress really modest with my face, hair, and body covered at all times. No one sees anything but my eyes and hands. I think I have nice skin, nice hair, and I nice body because I take care of all these things despite the fact that no one but God will ever see them; but I still worry that I could be vain somehow and shouldn't be meticulously applying body/face masks and scrubs.

Sorry if I seem scrupulous about all this. Just looking for answers.

"If Jesus was God and saved us from our sins, what about the people who lived and died before and during the time of Jesus?",Medical_Current3407,1621009131,"Simply a question here: If Jesus was God, then what happened to the people who died before he came to Earth and during the same time?

If Jesus died for our sins, then what about the people who died before his presence on Earth? Would their sins just not be forgiven then? And same with those that died when he was alive? Would they just not be saved then?

Also if Jesus was God, then why did he suffer and say that his Father was also our Father as well?

Moreover, if Jesus died for our sins, why is there still a Day of Judgment in which all will be judged for their actions? Surely we all would be admitted to Heaven regardless of our past actions since Jesus takes all the punishment for them right?

Why did he have to pray and to who? 

Along those same lines, the Bible also mentions that Israel is the firstborn / begotten son of God, yet why don’t Christians believe Israel was God as well?

I mean if our eyes can barely handle the sight of the sun, the source of light for an impure and imperfect world, how could our eyes handle the sight of our Lord right in front of us (or those back in the day)?

I believe that our Lord is infinitely greater than us and He cannot relate to us in any single way...no gender, doesn’t get tired or weak, and doesn’t get tempted by evil as He is the Creator of all...I just don’t see the dots connecting. 

Here are a few more questions I have:

Why don’t Christian women cover their heads while praying as Muslim women do as the Bible instructs them to? (1 Corinthians 11: 4-6)

When Jesus says “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work” (John 4: 34),

How do you come to the conclusion that Jesus is God after reading such a statement that makes a clear case that Jesus was sent by God (separate from Him). 

Also, how would it make sense that Jesus, as Christians say is God (therefore equal to the Creator), was murdered as God the Creator cannot be murdered at all since He is God the Almighty.  

If Jesus was fully God and fully human, then surely his full nature of being God would make it  impossible for him to be tempted by Satan and then murdered by his creation?

"Is it a sin to participate in/profit from a stock market ""short squeeze"" (eg, GameStop, AMC, etc)?",Admirable-Leopard396,1621004520,"It appears several hedge funds (HFs) shorted millions and millions of shares of some companies. Some people think that more than 100% of all GameStop (GME) shares have been shorted. It appears that the HFs were trying to intentionally lower the price of GME to make lots of money from short-selling.

People have theorized that if lots of investors were to buy up as many shares of GME as possible, and just hold on to them, then the price of the stock would go up. The HFs are required to buy back (cover) all of the shares they shorted, but if no one's selling at the current stock price, the price will inevitably go up.

There are several subreddits that discuss this. There appears to be an absolute frenzy of thousands (millions?) of people buying and holding GME and AMC stock in the hopes that there will be a short squeeze (in fact, hoping for the biggest short squeeze in history - the MOASS - Mother of All Short Squeezes). Many people think, if the MOASS happens, the share price could reach tens of thousands of dollars, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars - and the HFs would be required to buy the stock back at those prices.

If such a thing were to happen, those HFs would go totally bankrupt, their insurers could also go bankrupt, other brokers could go bankrupt, etc, and who knows what would happen to the rest of the stock market or the US or even world economy as a whole.

In my view, the HFs are responsible for creating this mess by shorting millions of shares that don't exist, and for trying to intentionally drive a company's stock price down in order to make money.

I wonder, though, is it a sin to buy GME stocks in the hopes of the MOASS?

I would consider market manipulation to be a sin. **Is buying and holding GME considered market manipulation?** I bought some shares of GME and AMC a few weeks ago, and I didn't really think it was a sin because I was simply buying shares, but thinking about it more now, I'm not so sure. I haven't made any agreements with anyone to only sell at a certain price or do anything else - I found out about all this stuff just by browsing reddit - but I admit I am hoping other people will hold on to their shares as long as possible so that the price will go up. And I think everyone else who is buying/holding GME is hoping for that too. Is this wrong?",Catholicism

Vaccines and abortion cell lines,moralxdilemma,1621002494,"The pfizer, moderna, and johnson vaccines all use fetal cell lines from abortions that were performed several decades ago.  Basically, as I understand it, the abortions were performed and cells collected from the fetus, and then those cells are cultured or grown or however it's called, and that's what's being used today.  The pfizer and moderna vaccines are using the cell lines in the testing phase and the johnson vaccine uses them in the production phase, but all three vaccines use the cell lines as part of their process.  

We've been told that the pfizer and moderna vaccines are acceptable, but that the johnson vaccine is only acceptable if there isn't an option to take the pfizer or moderna.  My confusion is why this is the case?  They all three seem indistinguishable to me in terms of deriving from an abortion.  The testing vs production distinction seems very arbitrary to me.  (To be honest, I'm also ambivalent about worrying about the source of the cells in the first place.  If all abortions ended permanently today, we would still have the cell lines available.  They aren't hurting anyone at this point.)  

But, if there are special circumstances that must be met to take the Johnson vaccine licitly, why are the moderna and pfizer vaccines considered ""better"" or exempt from needing special circumstances?  

I haven't gotten my vaccine yet.  I live in an area where all three are being offered, and I'd rather get one shot instead of two.  But I'm also trying really hard to be obedient to the church.  It would help me a lot to be able to properly wrap my head around the reasoning here.",Catholicism

The book of Revelation gives a symbolic description of Heaven, saying it is like a city with 12 foundations, each of which was associated with an Apostle: ""And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."" (Rev 21:14) 

It goes on to say that ""The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel."" (Rev 21: 19a) The twelfth foundation was adorned with amethyst (Rev 21: 20, end).

Now who was the 12th Apostle? It was Judas Iscariot, who after falling away was replaced by Saint Matthias (whose feast day is today). Saint Matthias, therefore, was the very first person to be a successor to an Apostle.

This custom of having successors to the Apostles continues to this day, only now we call them something else: bishops. And since Saint Matthias, the first successor to an Apostle, is associated with the 12th foundation of the city (adorned with amethyst), other bishops often, by custom, also wear a purple stone to show that they too are successors of the Apostles.

And that's why I wear a pectoral cross with a purple stone in it. Saint Matthias, pray for me, and for all my brother bishops, as we try and follow in your footsteps as successors of the Apostles!",Catholicism

I’m fairly new to fully embracing the deep beauty of our faith, and have incorporated daily rosaries into my routine. 

I follow some Catholic commentators, and was recently shocked to see claims from folks like Dr. Taylor Marshall that the Luminous Mysteries are heretical. (I think that his general stance is that Vatican II and everything after it is in error—I highly disagree.)

His points seem to be that (1) if we believe Our Lady directly taught the mysteries to St. Dominic, it’s wrong to put ourselves in her shoes, and (2) there are supposed to be 15 decades total. Fifteen? My rosary only has five! Can anyone help clear this up for me? Does he mean fifteen between the mysteries?",Catholicism

How can I repent and be forgiven ? Abused people years ago,Tough-Explanation-90,1620996589,"Years ago I was extremely mean to a little girl at my grandmothers daycare when I was about 17 or 18. It may not have been as mean as my mind is making it seem NOW but I feel immense guilt. I probably treated her like a sibling which included physical discipline. Now I’m a mother and wonder will my child face the same things from those that watch her. Do I owe the girl and her mother an apology ? This was wellll over 10 years ago. I have no idea if the little girl even remembers. Also, years ago I reacted poorly several times to being hit by elderly patients. One instance I reported myself to my employer but nothing ever came of it. I felt immense guilt and cried out to God that if he would please forgive me and take the guilt I would NEVER act on that manner again and IF I did I would report myself to the authorities. Well I stupidly responded once again. This was about 3 years ago but I have changed significantly. My fear is though that I created a vow and dishonored it. Will I be doomed to hell because I made the vow and didn’t honor it ? I really want to move forward. I feel sooo bad when patients today tell me how wonderful and caring I am when I remember my past behavior. Not an excuse but I DO deal with scrupulosity and trying to earn my salvation thru means of confession and restitution. Also am I in a state of CONSTANT sin being that I’m a mandated reporter ? The law says report abuse. I myself have done wrong and seen and HeARD about others. I had a girl tell me something a year after it happened. If the law doesn’t change am I to tell on her ?

I'm 2 weeks away from...the talk. Advice/Prayers I guess.,Rauswaffen,1620993345,"Hi All,

So my son (oldest child) is turning 11 at the end of the month. I am taking him on a 4 day field trip to some Air Force Museums (we are into that stuff) and have decided that the 8 hour drive(s) and road stops will be prefect for.....***the talk.***

Joking aside, this is the first time I'm explicitly planning to talk to him about sex, sexuality, marriage, the theology of our bodies, etc. Some of these topics have come up in the past, but never in depth. I consider myself pretty well versed in the Catholic teachings on these topics and am not too worried about it, but I do want to make sure that I am setting him up to understand God's purpose for sex and marriage and to prepare him for the vile crap (porn + our culture's approach to sex) he is going to come across in his life (Lord knows I have, and continue, to struggle with that). 

I realized there is never just *one* talk. I am ready to have this be an open topic of conversation going forward.

For some background: I converted 2 years ago to the faith, and my son and daughter were both baptized last month. He first communion was two weeks ago, so it is a great time for the faith in our family.

I'm not even sure what I'm going for here, just getting my worries off of my chest. I'd appreciate any prayers, advice, or stories from your first ""talks"" with your kids if you don't mind. Thank you!

Stuck between catholicism and atheism,RedactedByChina,1620983232,"Hey, what's up? I'd like to ask you people for your opinion, I'm currently in some kind of identification crisis.

I was raised as a Roman-catholic christian by my Polish roman-catholic mother and my German protestant father. I believed in God, nailed religious education and even wrote my final exam on it, and was very proud when I received my first communion and my confirmation (I'm not sure if these are the correct terms in English).

When I was 16, I became an atheist due to the lack of proof and scientific evidence. I've been living with my family's religiosity since then but I never went to church except on holidays when they asked me to. Church and religion didn't feel like something that belonged to me anymore. 

Nowadays I'm 21 years old and Im feeling that a strong attraction towards my former religion is growing inside me. I still don't think I believe in God, in Jesus or in the Bible anymore but on the other side, praying and going to church have started to feel more important and natural to me than ever before.

"Don’t judge, looking for guidance",Zimzarian,1620967876,"So I was raised a catholic, I’m baptized, did my holy communion and confirmation as a child. However, as a child it’s been forced on us by school and my parents weren’t into teaching religion at home, so I learned the basics but never really took the time to actually understand.

When I got to my teenage years, I stopped believing completely, having no reason in my head to believe. Couple that with bad influences, heavy metal, drug use and I was a mess. Good thing that stopped completely when I got older and I’m a somewhat normal and kind human being nowadays!

Now I’m in my 30s and my spirituality is awaking or so it seems. I don’t know what it is, I can’t really explain but I have this thought in my head to reconnect with my faith and just see where it takes me.

I don’t know, I don’t think I can say I’m a catholic anymore, haven’t been to church in forever and don’t even know where to start. All I know is this feeling inside me won’t go away.

I made mistakes in life and lately I feel lost, without a purpose. I try to better myself everyday lately and that’s when these thoughts of reconnecting with my faith came. I dunno I’m just rambling at this point.

Thoughts on Fatima: Some historical background behind the apparitions that I was never aware of,nessiewatcher4lyfe,1620965634,"I confess that in all my research on Fatima, I'm still discovering new stuff, which is both cool and embarassing. I say embarassing because in dealing with such a huge event, not knowing some of these things is, at least to me, a sign of naivete. It'd be like not knowing that there was a grassy knoll or that Stanley Kubrick filmed 2001: Space Odyssey a year before Apollo 11. . .

What I'm saying is, *this stuff gets pretty deep! ! !*

**Some Background**

Now, I was aware that the children were imprisoned at one point--yes, the Fatima children went to jail, in case you were unawares. And the police threatened to torture them if they did not tell the secret Mary had told them. The police also attempted to conjole them into recanting their witness testimony in regards to the apparitions, but no dice. At last, the police took them one by one and threatened to *throw them into a pot of boiling oil,* not revealing to the others that this was a lie. So one by one, starting with Jacinta I believe, they went to their death *firm in their belief in the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary.*

**New Info**

So that was old hat to me. Here is where the naivete comes in: I didn't know that Portugal had seen several years of political unrest, with *communism dominating the scene* at the time. In fact, Lisbon was considered the *most atheistic city in Europe*. Lenin, in fact, saw Portugal as integral to the plan of communist world domination, acclaiming that the communist revolution would begin (in 1910) simultaneously in Russia and Portugal--by the end of things, communism was prophesied to steamroll all of Europe.  
In Portugal, churches were destroyed, blasphemies uttered, priests killed, politicians murdered, etc. The communist take-over was well underway at this time. We all know of the newspaper *O Seculo* which reported on the Fatima Miracle--this was a secular paper. The judge who interrogated the Fatima children at the jail was secular. Secularism was everywhere. The Fatima believers were mocked, laughed to scorn--more than that, they were threatened, with people even blowing up the makeshift shrines at the Cova with bombs. Secular thugs stole the devotional items from the Cova as well, at one point even attempting to cut down the Holm Oak, but they accidentally chopped down the wrong tree.  
The newspapers loudly proclaimed these secularization campaigns as successful in stifling the foolishness of religious fanaticism which was coming out of the kooky Fatima scene. Portuguese atheists predicted religion would be eradicated by the third decade of the 20th century! Nonetheless, many secular folks as well as atheists witnessed the Miracle of the Sun and were converted. Scientists, politicians, rich and poor--they all saw the Miracle and were astounded. Witness testimony shows this to be true. And these were witnesses spread out over a geographical region of something like 20 miles? ? ? 

**In Perspective**

So taking this all into account, it changes the whole jail scene for me. Here I always thought of it as kind of cute, like the adults were just messing with the kids in a cute kind of way. Supposedly the people in the jail cells attempted to comfort the children during their stay--told them they weren't going to be killed for telling a lie or not cooperating. The children still stuck to their guns.

Now, after reading about how entrenched communism was at the time, I realize that the situation was much more grim. It *is* a little pathetic to threaten children like that when you have a position of authority; but people were actually trying to erase what these kids stood for, what they experienced: *their identity as Christians.* Nowadays there is similar stuff going on. There's a big push to eradicate our identity as Catholics, as Christians, and it is being driven by secular forces again. They've been perpetrating it on our children--they perpetrated it on myself as a child and many others like me. My being Catholic at this moment is my solemn testimony--like stern Lucia's, like bold Francisco's, like sweet Jacinta's--it is my way of saying, *the buck stops here.* I am Catholic. I believe in the Miracle. I believe in God.

It goes to show that even when surrounded by enemies of the faith on all sides, God still gives His children the strength to persevere despite their weaknesses. He carries us through the snare of the fowler: through the guns of communism, through the bleak heresies of secularism. And in the end He shows us the most miraculous vision ever seen--even throughout all of salvation history! ! ! Something so great, so marvelous that all who see it proclaim, *the Hand of God! ! !*

In our own individual lives there are miracles like that big Miracle of the Sun. Jesus is present in these miracles, along with His Blessed Mother, even many Angels and Saints. But now I've gone off the rails. Sorry! Check out this book *Meet the Witnesses of the Miracle of the Sun,* by John Haffert. I found it at Half Price Books near me, so that's pretty cool. Or, just find a book on Fatima--they're all always really interesting! This Miracle continues to hold importance to us today. As the author of that book says, it's the only act of God in all of salvation history where a specific date was revealed and enacted. 

Equally interesting, as pointed out by the author--because the children were detained in jail they missed an appointment with the Blessed Virgin. When they next saw Our Lady, she told them that the Miracle would be less than what it would have been because of these men's actions. . . in other words, the Miracle witnessed by thousands over miles, the Miracle of the Sun crashing to the Earth but nobody being killed, the miracle of flashing monochromatic beams of light all over the Earth, turning some people blue, purple, green, red, yellow, the miracle of puddles of rain drying up in an instant, people screaming and crying, the sun consuming the whole field of vision, this miracle would have been even *greater* had not a few men's actions been so uncouth. Amazing! ! !

"Considering converting to Catholicism, but I can’t get past the Marian dogmas",GarthBrooksFan,1620946702,"I’m actually a cradle Catholic, my Mom became Protestant when I was 13 so I converted with her and spent my teenage years as a Methodist.

Recently I’ve been re-examining my beliefs and I’m starting to think that Catholicism is actually correct and am thinking of heading back to it. I’ve been studying the Church fathers, the catechism, etc and am agreeing with almost all Catholic doctrine, but I can’t get past the church’s beliefs on Mary.

To be sure, I do not believe that Catholics worship Mary. I also think there’s sufficient evidence to say that she remained a virgin after Jesus’ birth and for the rest of her life. But I can’t get past the notion that Mary was totally sinless. For one thing, Jesus seems to rebuke Mary in Luke 8:19-21 and especially Matthew 12:46-50. 

Perhaps most importantly, the Church fathers don’t seem to support a sinless Mary. Basil says that at the foot of the cross, Mary suffered from unbelief. Origen says the same thing. https://gavinortlund.com/2020/12/18/church-fathers-who-denied-the-immaculate-conception/ This link shows my sources.

So how does one reconcile this? I’m especially interested in the church fathers statements on this, it seems to me that no one thought Mary was sinless until the fourth century.

One last thing, I’m aware that Ignatius of Antioch as well as Justin Martyr say nice things about Mary. That’s all fine, but nothing in their writings seem to indicate sinlessness.",Catholicism

This is not just accepting your sufferings with devotions, this is self inflicted suffering (in some way like fasting) offered for souls in purgatory, penance, conversion of sinners, etc...

Obstacles as I'm coming back to the faith.,LucasOfNovoRiacho,1620942332,"Hi guys! I am a 21 years old brazilian and I'm humbly coming back to the Catholic Church. Last year I convinced myself that life had no meaning or beauty without the true faith. The problem is that I am very skeptical when it comes to religious people. I was raised in a family where most people didn't care about God, and those who cared were very fundamentalist, rude and superstitious. Today, when I see a believer responding to an atheist claim against Christianity, I struggle to consider it, even when the christian seems more reasonable. I am really afraid of being deceived, specially when I read responses to critiques of the Bible's historicity and history of the Church. Bart Ehrman, for example, is a scholar that has been bothering me recently. His arguments are really good and I haven't seen some good responses to him in public debates (maybe I should read more).

I have a really strong feeling that Catholicism is true and I have faith that some day I will be at peace with it. But now I have too many doubts in my head to live like a true follower of Jesus Christ. Anyway, could anyone provide me some reliable resource that deal with these issues?

Want to become Catholic,SkippyjonJones99,1620932412,"Hello everyone
I have two questions 

I am dating a Catholic. My family is also Catholic and I was baptized. However, when my family moved they could no longer attend the church that they previously attended. They stopped going as they tried multiple new churches in the area and had terrible experiences from racism (which I believe is more due to the area rather than the church themselves). So growing up I was never taken to Church. Since we have been dating for the past 3 years I have gone to Church with him and sometimes his family every Sunday. But I never take communion as I have not had my first communion. I only go up for a blessing. I want to commit to being Catholic and learn more but I don’t know where to start. I have not had my first communion or confession.


My other question is that he is graduating college and I would like to get him a cross necklace. A simple one maybe black or silver.  And was thinking of having it engraved with Psalm 128:2.

Problem was, I didn't realise when they said Christian club they really meant Protestant club.

For example, we have a bible study on Galatians, and they keep pointing out faith without works. But then I go to my catholic church and the priest says faith is not enough, that it just opens the gates to heaven?

It has been very confusing. In the bible it says be wary of false teachers. And that's why I am here. I don't know what to do. I still see them as my friends, but they are very anti catholic. Going as far to say that a catholic that converted to their religion converted to Christianity. Implying that he wasn't a Christian as a catholic.

Happy Glorious Feast of the Ascension!!,desert_rose_376,1620916419,"Glory to Jesus Christ!!

When we pray the the second glorious mystery of the Rosary, we pray for hope. We are hopeful because Christ ascends and takes our human nature with Him. Human nature is restored to the place it was before the fall. Christ brings our fallen human nature from the depths of Hades to the throne on High, to an infinite majesty. Because Christ bears us all, this means part of us is already in Heaven. We are hopeful because of what Christ has done and should always look up to Christ and not down to our own brokenness. 

""Through the mystery of the Ascension we, who seemed unworthy of God's earth, are taken up into Heaven. Our very nature, against which the Cheribum guarded against the gates of Paradise, is enthroned today high above all Cheribum."" - St. John Chrysostom

Even angels were amazed as Jesus ascends with our human nature to the Throne of Heaven. Our nature is restored to where it was intended to be. Our journey of theosis/divinization (becoming like Christ) can now reach where it was meant to be, for all people. The repayment for our insolence is the gift of Heaven and the divinization of our human nature in union with Christ.",Catholicism

Corruption and sin,Pedrop64,1620910129,"I posted it on r/askapriest , but I'm putting here too so I can read your opinions

I started to learn how to drive a car at the end of the last year, but where I live you can only drive (even with a person at your side) after you complete the driving test, which isn't that hard. The examiners, however, are very inclined to corruption, some ask for bribes, and I have reasons to believe they actually disapprove people on purpose so we have to pay again to take the test (it's really expensive), and the agency profits with it. The system is obviously flawed, although I have no guarantees who are the corrupt examiners. There's a big debate on that, and almost every year we heard about corruption scandals among them (Brazilians call it ""The Traffic Safety Agency Mafia"")

I had to take the test for the third time today, and a friend from my family who works in the agency said that she can help me to get approved, because most examiners 'pick' people to fail on the test, so I would have to be lucky enough to be examined by someone who does not want me to fail.

*  When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation. 
* One of the few people allowed in to see the Pope at the Gemelli Clinic was one of his closest friends philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, who arrived three days later to keep him company as he recovered.  
*  Later he is quoted as saying, *Could I forget that the event in St. Peter's Square took place on the day and at the hour when the first appearance of the Mother of Christ to the poor little peasants has been remembered for over sixty years at Fátima, Portugal? For in everything that happened to me on that very day, I felt that extraordinary motherly protection and care, which turned out to be stronger than the deadly bullet*

When I put up Part one yesterday - h/himimit shared this fascinating comment  (reddit at its best!) 

*After the operation Professor Crucitti, the surgeon who conducted it, stated that the nine-millimeter bullet went through the Pope's body in an unbelievable way, avoiding all vital organs ""****as if some invisible hand guided it****"". It passed the main artery only by a few millimeters, the damage of which is instant death. It spared the spinal cord and other vital organs.*

*Also, the route through the congested streets of Rome to the Agostino Gemelli polyclinic usually took up to half an hour, but for the ambulance carrying the saint pope, it took them just eight minutes. They weren't accompanied by any escort.*

Fitting in?,Gordous_the_tortoise,1620884532,"A question (or rant?): Does anyone else have a hard time fitting in with other Catholics? 

I grew up “Catholic” as in I was dragged to mass every weekend but did not associate with it any more than that. Towards the end of college, I had a big conversion experience and turned my life around (*more accurately, started the process of continually turning it around forever). It’s amazing and I absolutely love it. 

Now, a few years down the line, I want more and more to be a member of this community. Make some friends who share this incredible faith and not just hang out with secular people. The only problem is that it’s mostly just geriatrics. And the people who weren’t born in the Mesozoic Era, the few 20-30 somethings in the mix, are just kinda.... weird. 

It’s very clique-y, there just seems to be an unspoken competition to out holy each other, people are always looking for excuses to use some fancy schmancy verbiage to moralize others (i.e. “With all due respect, your interpretation of this dogma is extremely heretical and rife with heathenism and you are committing grave sin and should further discern blahblahblah as it says on page 420698008 of the catechism blahblahlah buzzwordbuzzwordbuzzword” like a bunch of nerds arguing about DnD rules). It’s extremely goodie two shoes. Many people just have this very nervous, overly nice, kinda naive vibe to them. There’s just no edge to anyone.

I get that we’re not supposed to be concerned with worldly things, that we should strive for innocence and sainthood, I’m all for that.  But MAN does anyone ever just cut loose a little bit? Can I say a bad word or tell an edgy joke or just cut up to any degree without completely scandalizing the sometimes slightly sanctimonious catholic community? 

The other side of the coin is the secular Catholics, but that’s not much different than my current situation. 

Sorry for absolutely DUMPING here and going all over the place, but dang son, I just feel like a fish out of water.

Annulment Process/Questions,Reservist6319,1620882896,"Background:

Hello. My fiance and I are currently trying to start marriage prep but an issue came up with her previously being in a civil marriage (they divorced about 9 years ago) We have been together for about two years. When talking to our parish marriage prep counselor she asked about previous marriages so we discussed that my fiance was married through the legal system because her ex husband and her had a child together. The counselor said this would be a big issue with moving forward. I don't know much about the annulment process and could use some guidance in the possibility we need to build a case. One piece of information I know is that her ex-husband was actually married through the church to another woman before my fiance and her ex husband got a civil marriage (He never received an annulment for that original marriage) I have two questions;

Do civil union marriages need a religious annulment? and if so...

Would his first legitimate marriage through the church make their union iligetitmate and be ground for an annulment? 

TLDR; My fiance and I want to get married through Catholic Church. She was in a civil marriage prior (9 years ago) her ex husband was married through the Catholic church to his first wife and never received an annulment. 

Will it be necessary for my fiance to receive an annulment for her previous marriage and if so, is her ex husbands first marriage grounds for an annulment since he never received an annulment?

"An open letter to all of the religious people in this sub, part 3 (from r/atheism, edited slight)",Theo0033,1620873074,"This is part 3. The other 2 parts are on r/atheism, from awhile ago. 

Atheism is right here. It's literally the default position. But you don't have enough faith to be an atheist.

You think that an atheistic worldview is so absurd that theism is the rational position.

This is going to come from one of two camps:

1. The Kalam cosmological argument
2. The fine-tuning argument.

The Kalam cosmological argument is simple:

1. Whatever begins to exist must have a cause.
2. The universe began to exist.
3. Therefore, the universe must have a cause.

It falls short of being an argument for theism, but it can be used to show that there's more than this universe out there.

But, the problem, is, once we discover that thing outside the universe that caused our universe, the Kalam cosmological argument applies to that too.

If you accept that everything began to exist, and that whatever began to exist has a cause...

you need turtles all the way down. If everything must be held up, nothing can hold everything up.

So, there was something that either

(a) began to exist without cause, or

(b) always existed.

According to the Kalam cosmological argument, it has to be (b).

The problem, however, is that anything that can be applied to God can also apply to the universe itself. ""God always existed"" and ""the universe always existed"" can both be true, unless there's some special property about the universe that ensures that it has a definite beginning.

We don't know that the universe has a beginning. We only know that all matter converged to a point at one point in time. We don't know what it was like during the first few microseconds after that. We don't know what happened before that - or if ""before that"" has any meaning.

Additionally, things might be able to begin to exist without cause. It doesn't make sense - but neither did the concept of electricity coming from clouds rubbing together to the ancient Greeks. We only know about behavior within the universe - not behavior outside the universe.

The other argument here is the fine-tuning argument.

The fine tuning argument claims that the Earth (or the universe)

Imagine a nuclear war devastated the world, and only the poles were left without devastation. Polar bears quickly evolved to become sapient enough to contemplate reality, but only know the North Pole. Would it not be ridiculous for them to say that the Earth was designed by God, just to have them in it?

We've adapted to the climate that our planet has, because life is adaptable. We've seen even bacteria adapt and evolve to hostile climates. We can see that with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Would an antibiotic resistant bacterium not be ridiculous saying ""God made sure that I could thrive, fine-tuning this bloodstream to be free of chemicals that can kill me""?

There's also some about the improbability of this planet being the right conditions for any form of life, but we're one planet, in a vast universe. The fine tuning argument about Earth would have made more sense back when Earth was the only planet we knew of.

Additionally, these only really apply for life as we know it. Life as we don't know it could be far more abundant - potentially something similar based on a completely different set of chemicals. We don't know what life could be like.

Hell, there could be different life in different universes. To a being in a different hypothetical universe, ours might die a heat death in a blink of one of their eyes, and be deemed one of the universes that don't bear life.

The fine-tuning argument is based on short-sightedness and lack of perspective. It only makes sense when you think that life has to have a specific type of physics, a specific type of chemistry, and a specific set of conditions, and it has to be a specific way, in order to emerge.

&amp;#x200B;

Natural Family Planning (NFP),StubbornlyBreathing,1620870345,"Hey guys, I'm looking for some good word/perspective here.

My spouse and I have NFP down to the science that it is, we understand the biology and everything. That's not the issue.

After two kids back to back we're just finding that our sex life is total crap. We have a dead bedroom pretty much. Sex has become even more of a chore for my spouse who has a low lindo. I have a high libido and sex is a critical part of the relationship, because if I can't intimately share myself it's like I'm just living with a roommate who helps take care of the kids. That's not marriage, that's basically just a transactional relationship where each person does what they can untill the kids are independent.

Before the kids, NFP was no big deal. It was basically a two week fast, but now it has become a huge strain in our lives. By the time we can actually be intimate each month I'm desperate, dejected, and frustrated, and my spouse feels like it's just to upkeep the relationship because it's not that special to them. They can take it or leave it, they don't need it like I do.

We've tried talking through it to come to a solution but that got us nowhere. Communication only gets two ignorant people so far.

Having a Pope to guide the 1.1 billion Catholics in the world is one of the best things in Catholicism.,zogins,1620857213,"Catholicism was until some years ago the largest religion in the world as regards number of 'members'. We have been surpassed by Moslems a few years ago.

What I see when I look at different religions and different Christian denominations is that they seem to make the rules as they go along and the rules are different for every small congregation depending on who their pastor/ preacher is.

I have had members of other religions tell me terrible things like ""God is vindictive or only God forgives sinners, we humans are obliged to punish sinners"". 

Our Pope is the central beacon of light and wisdom - a direct descendent of St. Peter. His pronouncements especially when he is Ex Cathedra are considered infallible and serve as an unquestionable moral compass for us.",Catholicism

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;VATICAN CITY (CNS) — Calling for formal recognition of “those lay men  and women who feel called by virtue of their baptism to cooperate in  the work of catechesis,” Pope Francis has instituted the “ministry of  catechist.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“The Spirit is calling men and women to set out and encounter all  those who are waiting to discover the beauty, goodness and truth of the  Christian faith,” the pope wrote in “Antiquum Ministerium” (Ancient  Ministry), his document released at the Vatican May 11.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to releasing texts of the document in Italian, French,  English, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Polish, the Vatican distributed  a video of the text translated into Italian sign language.

Our bishops and our priests teach us that tax evasion is a sin. I sometimes find myself in the dilemma where I know that my tax Euros are going to pay for IVF (where some embryos are discarded).

When the Church wants to hold processions or outside gatherings, they go through the right channels and ask for police permits (so that traffic can be diverted etc.)

Recently, groups of Moslems have started to do random acts of civil disobedience. For example they gather in large groups (a couple of hundred) on beach promenades for Friday prayers. They block pavements and roads and create chaos. 

Some Maltese citizens have started to counter this by quickly gathering and excercising their rights to walk their dogs and picnic on ham sandwiches in the same public area where the Moslems are praying. The Moslems are calling this 'persecution'.

4. If the Church in Germany goes into schism corporately, what kind of structure would the Church establish for the remaining faithful there?

Anyway,  there is no communication at all between the lay people and the ""church  parish council"" (Kirchengemeinderat), who are also lay people that  basically make descisions on budget issues and provide the parish with a  general direction. The priest only has 1 vote out of 12 as far as I  know (you see how troubling this can be).

I am quite baffled by this, because it really seems that  90% of Catholics in Germany have no issue with what's going on.

Advice for my cousin on chastity?,Emergency-Historian,1620845852,"So, I am a college female who is worried about her cousin, who is also a college female.  My cousin is active at her school, very social, and currently single. She has always told me that she is waiting til marriage. Plus, she is Baptist, so I have seen her going to church and attending Bible studies. Well, she told me something on Easter that made me feel uneasy and concerned. She told me that a while ago she went to a guy’s house she was interested in and they were alone. Well, they started kissing, and this guy thought it would be ok to cop a feel. My cousin was able to put a stop to it, but because she was alone, I keep thinking what if this guy continued to take advantage of her and she couldn’t   do anything about it? Also, I don’t like how she wasn’t respecting herself or the other person emotionally/spiritually because she thought it was ok to passionately kiss with him. I’m just worried about her doing it again and her finding herself in danger or giving herself away emotionally and then regretting it later. Once she told me this story, all I could think to say was I’m so sorry that happened to you, but I am kicking myself because I should have told her that the Lord doesn’t want us to share intimate moments like that outside of marriage, and at least tried to point her in the right direction.  Since then, I have worried about her and I was wondering if it would be alright if I texted her to let her know I have been thinking about her? I also want to show I care because I really don’t want her to find herself in an awful situation again. Or is this something that is me overstepping my bounds and it’s best I just continue to pray for her?

I know nothing about the Catholic Church...but I want to.,Forsaken-Baker6262,1620839726,"Where do I even begin? 

My parents got divorced when I was 1 year old. My mom, who does not go to church, is the parent with who I primarily lived with so I never got to fully learn about the Church with my dad, who is very active in his faith. I attended church on the weekends I was with but never seriously involved in church. Then, when I was 12, I stopped seeing my dad and this cut off all ties I had with my dad's family who are all devoted Catholics as well.

2 months ago, I found out the tragic news about how my cousin recently committed suicide. His funeral was the first time I had been in church in 10 years. The emotions I had felt were so heavy during that time. I felt guilty for not going to Church and even more guilty that I couldn't easily relate to my dad's side of the family because I didn't know how to pray the rosary or the Apostle's creed. 

Besides that embarrassment, I do truly want to become a true Catholic. I was baptized in the Catholic Church but that is all. I have been reading the Bible lately and I have never felt more comfortable and at peace. I found a church that I really enjoy going to and I feel welcome. The small issue that I have is, I really known nothing about being Catholic and I also feel overwhelmed trying to do so much research. I try and participate as much as I can during mass but I felt so embarrassed last week when people went to receive the Eucharist and I kept standing with them until it was time to walk up and I realized that I couldn't go up because I haven't received my Holy Communion. The past few weeks, I noticed people sitting down and praying but I never knew for what until this past week when I realized I probably should have been sitting down with them. This morning, I just emailed my Deacon for information about RCIA classes, but I am also scared knowing that I have very little knowledge. What exactly will I be learning in RCIA classes when I attend? I am 19 but I need basic lessons that are taught to kindergartners I feel like. I am trying to push aside the embarrassment because become Catholic is my true goal but I feel overwhelmed. I don't really talk to my dad so I can't ask him questions but I really need some guidance. Can anyone just start me off with some basic knowledge of being Catholic? 

I barely learned that first comes baptism, then the Holy Eucharist (which I think is the same as First Holy Communion), and then Confirmation. However, if anyone can provide me just basic information about what I will be learning at RCIA classes and what I should know? 

I have been reading this Reddit group a lot and have seen very great responses so I am hoping someone can help me out!

I’ve recently been intrigued by religion and most importantly the Catholic way of faith. However, I am experiencing a dilemma. At first I didn’t think much about praying the rosary along with other prayers such as the one to St. Michael, the archangel, but now, I am questioning my behavior. I do not want to fall victim to idolatry. I’m not sure if I understand the difference between intercession and worship of the figures. Is the prayer to St. Michael actually okay to do? Also, how do I make sure I am respecting Mary and the saints with out doing so in a negative way? What types of behaviors/thoughts should I be mindful of to avoid idolatry?

Interested in your thoughts regarding Sean Carrol’s critique of cosmological arguments.,Caramal76,1620834518,"I was recently watching a debate between atheist Sean Carrol and William Lane Craig. The debate centered around Craig’s “Kalam Cosmological Argument” and Carrol’s basic denial of premise 1 (Everything that begins to exist must have a cause.) Catholics aren’t usually too crazy about the Kalam argument, and prefer some form of contingency style argument based on downward causation rather than causation backwards in time like we see in the Kalam.

But Carrol said the following that I thought actually seemed like pretty strong points:

""In our everyday lives, it makes sense to ask “why” this or that event occurs, but such questions have answers only because they are embedded in a larger explanatory context. In particular, because the world of our everyday experience is an emergent approximation with an extremely strong arrow of time, such that we can safely associate “causes” with subsequent “effects.” The universe, considered as all of reality (i.e. let’s include the multiverse, if any), isn’t like that. The right question to ask isn’t “Why did this happen?”, but “Could this have happened in accordance with the laws of physics?” As far as the universe and our current knowledge of the laws of physics is concerned, the answer is a resounding “Yes.” The demand for something more — a reason why the universe exists at all — is a relic piece of metaphysical baggage we would be better off to discard.""

""Can I build a model where the universe had a beginning but did not have a cause? The answer is yes. It’s been done. Thirty years ago, very famously, Stephen Hawking and Jim Hartle presented the no-boundary quantum cosmology model. The point about this model is not that it’s the right model, I don’t think that we’re anywhere near the right model yet. The point is that it’s completely self-contained. It is an entire history of the universe that does not rely on anything outside. It just is like that. The demand for more than a complete and consistent model that fits the data is a relic of a pre-scientific view of the world. My claim is that if you had a perfect cosmological model that accounted for the data you would go home and declare yourself having been victorious.""

The first statement, as I understand it, isn’t anything new or exciting. It’s basically the old idea from Kant’s refutation of cosmological arguments that basically says applying our notions of causality beyond the natural regime we are a part of I is pretty dubious. Carrol seems to be thinking that the arrow of time and laws of nature provide us an explanatory possibility that would be absent without them. So seeking explanations for these things themselves (time, physical laws, etc.) is misguided. That denial of the PSR isn’t self evident or anything, but it does seem somewhat intuitive to me.

His second point seems to build off the first. If we don’t decide to assert as a first principle that “every thing must be explained in some way”, and we are given a model of reality that matches the data, allows for correct predictions, and fits with our observed laws of nature, then we would be done. There are already models that fit this to some extent (although not perfectly matching the data) and will almost surely be more coming in the future. So, with that in mind, God doesn’t seem to be a particularly useful or needed concept in this view.

So it really seems to all come down to whether or not you accept a strong version of the PSR. If you believe “every single fact requires an explanation” then you should believe in God. If you believe “There are things which are required in order for explanations to exist, and you can’t explain these things because to do so, you must use them in their own explanation” then you have no need to believe in God.

The issue I’m having is that Carrol’s point actually seems right to me. If there was no time (and so events didn’t progress) and there were no laws (so we had no relationships between things which gave us expectations for their interactions) then there couldn’t be explanations for things. So before these things (time and laws) exist, there would be no explanations for things.

Views of Catholic Church on disease,TickTack3,1620828652,"I had a sociology lesson in my school as always. Professor that was teaching us about it was from begining telling us some disinformation etc.

When we came to the section ""Health and disease - different explanations"", I knew that Catholic Church will be mentioned in bad light as usually. Professor talked about history of explaining it and how we categorise these explanations. All religious explanations were named in same category (explanation that disease is: a form of punishment by god/God for sins, a test of individual, caused by evil spirits or devil etc.), but when Catholic Church was named as a case specifically, professor said, that they use exorcism to cure diseases because they believe it is caused by devil.

I knew this isn't the case, but the whole class was laughing, some pointed at me, because they know I am Catholic, so I couldn't really oppose this claim. Anyway, this doesn't matter.

Is it okay to dislike the Novus Ordo?,CrossOfScuple,1620826417,"These are my positions. I believe they are acceptable, but please correct me if they aren't:

1. The Novus Ordo allows too many options.
2. The Novus Ordo, when compared with the TLM, has watered down expressions of Catholicity (about sacrifice, the flowery language).
3. The problem is not just about the way Novus Ordo is offered (although that's a big part), but the missal itself. The black and red of the missal, while containing no heresy, has some extrinsic deficiencies like Memorial Acclamation and Preparation of the Gifts.
4. The Novus Ordo is a wound of the Church.

I say dislike, as in disliking the extrinsic rites. Intrinsically, I acknowledge that Masses done according to either forms are valid and licit; and thus intrinsically they are the same sacrifice of Calvary. But in terms extrinsic value of the rites, I believe that of the two missals have different values.

Copyright law and scruples - please help lol,Crash4815162342,1620824386,"For months now I’ve been driven insane by intellectual property law. I don’t know what to do. A part of me wishes I could just go back to being ignorant of all the minutia of these laws, and just read books and watch YouTube videos in peace again. I’ll set out a bunch of my worries and all the things I’m prevented from doing because of them. 

I realise this is quite a lot. Such is the mind of the scrupulous soul. I would just like some direction about how a Catholic should handle something like this. 

I want to read St. Thomas Aquinas. What could possibly go wrong? Well I buy a bunch of the Emaus press editions of his works. Turns out though that the translations in some are from just the right era that they easily fall into the category of being public domain in America but not in Australia. This is possible because America used to operate on a registration system. And the problem is, according to the Berne Convention article 16, such copies are “infringing copies” when imported.  I can’t even remember at this point if any of the translations actually do at this point. They probably do. Doesn’t matter though, because for the Latin text they used the Leonine editions, which seem like critical editions. I have no idea how the law for critical editions works in my country, nor for how it works in America. So for all I know, these leonine editions may have fallen into the public domain in America, but because Australia hasn’t addressed critical editions they may very well just fall into the 70+ years after authors death category, because the work doesn’t have to be “creative” in Australia. 

Now the problem is, Australian domestic law doesn’t say it’s illegal to import such copies, only this international “law” of the Berne convention. I don’t even know if I’m morally bound to follow it. I know according to Australian law I’m not legally blind by it, but who knows, maybe according to a philosophical account of the law I am. 

Couldn’t I just find public domain copies online on sites like the archive.org? Problem with that was that so many copies on there had things like library stamps, and Australian law would seem to consider even very basic designs copyrighted. And so, since I doubt whoever made these basic designs bothered to hand over the copyright of the work over to the library or something, because in America I doubt such things are copyrighted, it looks like we have a situation of the library distributing a work they don’t have the copyright rights to. However I think I found a way around this as long as I don’t download the PDF. 

Because of this public domain worry, I’m not even bothered to read the works of someone like Chesterton. Because he quotes so many authors, I would literally have to look up every author he quotes and make sure they died before 1955 just to make sure my copy of Chesterton’s work isn’t illegal. 

Trying to find a bible is also a nightmare. My two bibles I have spent good money on are both possibly illegal. One has a map in it that was taken from a 1910 public domain edition or something like that. I have no idea how I’d track down the designer of the map, so I could never be sure wether it’s public domain in Australia or not. As long as he lived another 45 years after he designed it, it’s not public domain. My Rsv CE seems like it might be illegal, because the Rsv is a revised version of an earlier translation, and that translation is public domain in America because the copyright wasn’t renewed. For all I know, one of the translators might have died after 1955, and hence at least part of it is protected by copyright in Australia.

I also want to give a coworker interested in Christianity a copy of “story of a soul”. Problem is, it has quotes from the Douay Rheims translation of scripture. And there’s many editions of it. For a l know, some of the quotes may be from the relatively recent ones, and these could be copyrighted in Australia based on some tiny difference. 

What else do I worry about? Well it seems like 50% of the stuff on YouTube or more is technically illegal. Australia has the most absurd and restrictive “fair dealing” laws. Now, a lot of stuff on YouTube, especially catholic YouTube, is from America, where you guys fortunately have “fair use” laws. I just don’t know wether it’s illegal for me import a video, book or anything else that has taken advantage of fair use, but which is not covered by fair dealing (which is a lot). It does seem like it may be technically illegal. So now, every time I see some YouTuber promote their Instagram account and use the Instagram logo, I stop watching the video, because they’ve used the logo in such a way that would not be covered by fair dealing. 

Because of the critical editions worry, I practically can’t read anything that was made before the printing press. Cant read even something like the Lingua Latina series, because they have excepts from ancient Latin texts, and those could be taken from critical editions. 

You might say “well surely the Australian authorities would realise that these are the consequences of the law and enforce them. Since they are obviously not concerned about any of these things, then it’s safe to assume it’s not illegal.” The problem is, from what I hear, it’s technically illegal to even forward an email in Australia because of fair dealing laws. There was a campaign of sorts for the laws to be changed, and they only seem to have stuck around because of financial interests. Australia doesn’t seem so concerned about actually enforcing these copyright laws, nor about their consequences, because most people don’t even think twice about them anyway.",Catholicism

For cradle Catholics - do you want to tell us about the difference between your faith and your parents.,curious_travelator,1620816401,"My parents were Irish Catholics born in the 1920s My Mum was with us until 2013.

She had a different faith than me. I am well educated in the faith. So when she passed away - My brothers and sisters left me to tell the story of her faith to the priest who was asking about her. In the most bizarre of coincidences. I knew the priest from when we were at school and used to serve mass. He's actually a world famous priest (for being an example of bearing difficult witness) but he came to prominence a few years after he buried my mother.

Anyway I did my mother proud and omitted perhaps the most unflattering aspects of her faith.

IRL I'm quite an argumentative person and when I go for a position I can be very strong and persuasive, my mother would evade that by interrupting me as I made my point by uttering these words

""It's 12 O'Clock - we'll say the Angelus"" I would then look at my very accurate watch which would say the time was 11:29 so no matter what I was saying she'd then say 

""The angel of the Lord declared unto Mary"" and the only acceptable response to that is 

""And she conceived of the Holy Ghost"" 

She used to enjoy doing that to me. 

One day she's *admonishing* me for one or other of my many failures as we were out shopping in the supermarket.

I had got a bit bored of this and I looked at my watch. It was 11:33 - quick as a flash I said 

""It's twelve o'clock let's say the Angelus - the Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary"" 

She started to say ""It's too soon it's not 12 but as she looked at her watch she thought - ""no I can't say that""

So we said our early angelus at 11:33 in the supermarket.

Thing is she never pulled the ""Let's say the angelus"" trick after that. Why she didn't who knows - she started to have signs of dementia and a couple of years later she had passed away.

Final Conversion of Relatives,Breifne21,1620811418,"My uncle Feilim has been put on a ventilator this morning. He's been battling Covid for a couple of weeks now, but, unfortunately, we've been told that he's unlikely to make it. 

For my part, it got me thinking of the mercy of God. Feilim is not religious, like everyone else in my family, he abandoned the faith in the past few decades. However, as a child, my distinctive memory of him was admiring a statue of the Infant of Prague in his house. He took it down from the mantlepiece and dusted it off, and handed it to me. He said, in his very relaxed way, ""Say a prayer for me, will you?"", chuckling a bit at the thought. 

I am struck this morning with sadness. I never did say that prayer for him. I should have prayed daily for his conversion, but I didn't. I should pray daily for the conversion of my whole family, but I don't. I get caught up in my own life, in my own problems and I never look to those whom God has put in my way.

Am I morally obligated to receive medication that is harmful to me?,Jazzlike-Business2,1620795063,"I was put on antipsychotic drugs against my will a while back while staying at a mental health facility. The drug itself is called aripiprazole (Abilify). Since taking it, I have experienced so called ""side-effects"", such as an unpleasant pain in all of my body, stiffness, and a feeling that ""something is not right"" (somatically, that is). I am 100% certain that these symptoms are a result of Abilify. This medication was forced upon me by the psychiatric establishment and my parents, who claimed I had psychosis (this was and still is not true). Since I was in the facility, I had no choice but to accept the medication, or else they would use violence to subdue me and give me the injection, thus I complied. 

I feel that I will not be able to live a full life with this medication, yet I am not listened to, and my parents insist that I take it for an ""longer period"" (probably because I have a history of mental illness).

May 9th homily written by me(Layperson) -Late post-,Thearpy-man,1620794865,"I know it a bit late. But I was busy this weekend and I wrote my own little reflection of the readings. 

I wrote it as if I were talking to some people who may be scrupulous or lacking the intellectual parts of Catholicism. The “...” are moments of silence for the congregation the think on what I just said. 

————————————————————

Love one another.... Is that so hard?.... You bet it is. Brothers and sisters let's look at the second reading once again... “Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love.”.... Well what exactly does it mean to be without love? You can definitely feel lonely and God is there for you, which is true, but that message lacks substance. However I think this is talking about spiritual loneliness, a loneliness that is not on fire for the lord… Picture of a dark room with a lit candle. The farther you walk away the less light you receive. This is what sin is. Sin is always the lack of love or abandonment. So once again “whoever is without love does not know God”. You can't see God's love as clear when you are in a state of sin, you are far away from the candle.  
    The first reading says “If you keep my Commandments, you will remain in my love”. Christ tells us how to remain in his love so we may love one another. To follow the Commandments requires real sacrifice. We are not Catholic because this lifestyle is easy…. These Commandments can definitely look intimidating. There will be times where you will fail and have scars…. There will be times where you want to give up or just question everything.... Now you may be struggling with, ummm lets say the eighth commandment, but how well are you treating the first, second or third commandment?... How can you expect to progress towards God’s love if something else is your God, or you do not give God what is his? Christ Gives us the answer to how we give God what is his, he says, ”This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.” But what does Christ mean by love. He means agape, seeking another’s benefit above your own, without expecting anything in return. Keep in mind he's saying this to his disciples after just dying on the cross. Christ says “No one has greater love than this,
to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”  If we apply agape we give to God what is his without a second thought of how it may benefit us. This happens in marriages,  friendships and should especially happen in your relationship with God. You can see so with Saint Peter in acts. Being ordained by Christ he has given up his life for him and Evangelizes for Christ and performs the miracle of speaking in tongues, through the holy spirit. Peter has mastered the virtues and it is evident by how the people fall at his feet but is humble and says “Get up, I myself am also a human being” demonstrating his humility.",Catholicism
Catholic response to coworker gossip?,EVPsalm4,1620792511,"For context, I work at a student union at a public university. Employees range from 19-24-ish years old and are all students.

Many of my coworkers in another department detest their boss. There is not a shift I’ve worked where they do not very vocally complain about her and honestly, speak very poorly about her. To be fair, I’ve seen some of her interactions/correspondence with them, and she can be terse and quite rude to them.

I’ve tried lots of different things to discourage the gossiping/slandering. Leaving negative conversations, encouraging empathy, etc. Today I even told them that if they are legitimately that frustrated, they should construct a letter and send it to her supervisor. Things don’t seem to change much though and people are perpetually frustrated.

Yet another D&amp;D post...,Zarakava,1620791698,"Hey all...

Was talking with my fiancee about maybe starting to play some DnD, and she's on board with it, except she wants to get rid of everything that might be too close to ""real magic"".

What she means by this is that if something is ""invoking real powers"", like fire or something, we can't do it. She has no problem with things like Harry Potter, because the magic comes from a ""fake source"" (The wizarding bloodline/internal self).

I mean... I don't think there's anything I can even really say to this, so I guess this is mostly a venting post, but I guess - is it possible for spirits to ""afflict"" someone if there's even a remote mention to something that might be close to ""real magic"", even if it's in a pretend setting?

Feeling so blessed to be in Jesus’ Church.,GolfBrosInc,1620788080,"I get caught up in life too often. Busy job, kids, cleaning, cooking, etc.

Take a couple minutes and deeply think about your faith. 

Jesus, the Word become flesh, dwelt among us. He established a New Covenant, He paid a debt He did not owe, because we owed a debt we could not pay. 

He established a Church. He gave her His authority, His seal of everlasting truth. He breathed the Holy Spirit on her, gave her the privilege of administering His sacraments. Gave her the privilege of administering the Eucharist. 

And if you are Catholic, you are right where you belong. 

You aren’t alone, ever. You have a blessed mother, a cloud of witnesses and family, all worshipping the Lord with you. Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God almighty.

Thoughts about the inaccessibility of local churches,quasimodofan,1620787868,"I’m coming back to the Church after a period of depression and just plain old bad times, but I’ve found it a very frustrating process when you’re a person (especially a young person) who has to deal with the unpredictability of life. I’m currently living in a bigger city than by home town, where there’s a few churches. Most of the people here work at restuaraunts or retail, including me, so jobs where you’re schedule can change any time of the day, shifts are unpredictable and no preference is given even if you tell your manager weekends aren’t the best, you’ll probably get scheduled at least one shift then anyway. Because of this, I’m often not able to attend mass on the weekend, or if I am, it usually has to be the 8 am one, which only one church in my town offers (most only seem to offer a sole Saturday vigil then two Sunday masses). This past week I did actually have some free time during the weekdays, so I went to pray at a local cathedral, which is beautiful, full of statues of the saints and a massive interior. My home doesn’t really have a private space to pray right now. Note, they are only open to visitors one hour each weekday. I go during the allotted time, sit down to say a rosary and get stopped by a security guard and told visitors can’t use the pews, they can just look around and then exit. It’s pretty embarrassing, since the cathedral is beautiful and I’d been looking forward the whole day to going and saying a rosary in such a place. I try to quickly search if the other churches in my area allow for private prayer or have adoration, and if they do, it’s once every two weeks on a Wednesday afternoon. And that got me thinking about how just...unavailable churches here are. Even before covid was a factor.

The same situation is true for confessions, usually once a week, Saturday for an hour. All the churches in my area, including the beautiful cathedral, are completely locked and unopen with the exception of mass times and the hour of confession on the weekend. If the Church is meant to be a home, how can I feel apart of it when the doors are locked anytime there isn’t a Saturday vigil or Sunday morning mass going on? If a church offers daily masses, it’s usually in middle of the average persons workday. Even when I do stay a few minutes after mass to pray when I can make a weekend one, there’s usually someone waiting to lock up the Church, and therefore waiting for me, to leave. It just feels incredibly unwelcoming sometimes and it’s no wonder so many churches are full of only retirees (this hurts to say, I’m sorry), because of how rigid the schedules are. I understand why churches cannot be open 24 hours, but by only being open for mass times it feels more like going into an entertainment venue than a place to worship and be with the Lord sometimes. 

Maybe this turned into a bit of a rant, but, I’d be curious if this was just a southeastern United States problem, or if it’s more broad. When I was visiting France and Italy, it was so comforting how for almost all churches, one could quietly step in during the day and pray. It’s almost like here church is more of a closed off space, where you quickly go if you’re schedule works with the very limited windows of time when one is allowed inside. I can’t help but feel a little defeated about the whole situation.",Catholicism

I Don't Know What To Do Anymore..It All Feels So Hopeless..,MidnightAxeMan,1620782141,"I am in a bit of a rough spot right now. Things suck for me and they only look to be getting worse but of course I can't know that for sure. 

So for starters I come from an..."" Interesting"" family. There is a lot of fighting, dysfunctionality, and just nastiness in my family. Everyone seems to hate everyone and there has never been peace. My mom is very toxic and abusive and unfortunately I had the privilege to grow up in the midst of its all. My mom has been awful to call of us. One of my siblings had issues with his weight and she was awful to him about it. I remember seeing her mercilessly bully my brother about this weight and make his life a living hell. I can write a novel about the abuse she has put everyone through considering it has been going on for the longest of time.  Yet for some reason she has always favoured my young brother who has been in and out of jail for the past 5 years or so. 

Since I was a small boy, I can recall my mother beating me a few times over some things I did. When I was a little kid, she beat me up for accidentally breaking a St.Michael statue. Then when I was about 9 or so she dished out a pretty bad beating to me for spraying butter on her pants( I was a stupid kid) Then as I grew older she became verbally abusive. I remember when I was about 11 she would talk on the phone to my stepdad( who was physically abusive at times)  about how she believed I was retarded, stupid, insane, and would end up in jail one day. This hurt my feelings but there was nothing that could be done. This was also around the time my father died of a bad heart attack. I remember seeing his dead body in the mourge. I wish I hadn't as that memory still bothers me to this day. At this time I was beginning to have a lot of behavioral issues at school due to how bad I was feeling about my home life. The abuse continued and worsend throughout my teen years. She would call me names, encourage me to kill myself, tell me I was ugly and so on so forth. She would always tell me she would look forward to the day I would turn 18 so she could kick me out and leave me homeless.

 Needless to say my teen years were rough. There was a lot of verbal abuse, and sometimes physical abuse from my stepdad, school problems, mental health problems, weight gain, and as of last year, lots of drug use. Is any of this normal? Are moms supposed to be like this? My older brother says I am just acting like a girl and tells me to man up. I have ADHD and am trying to finish high school and do something with my life. It all feels so hopeless and I am so scared of the years to come. Sometimes I think about killing myself but I fear what lays on the other side of this miserable existence we call life. My mom kicked me out before and has done so again just recently. I am 20 miles from.my job and school and I dont think I can win anymore. I am strongly considering ending my life as I cant take it anymore.  

As hopeless as it seems I accept this suffering as God's way of molding me into a better human being. I wish God would end my life so I Don t have to. Please pray for me.",Catholicism

Careful wording,GardenVarietyPFS,1620779890,"I want to be very careful how I word this because I don't in anyway want to start a political discussion, my question is **completely** faith related. I am not yet a member of the faith, but still plan on doing so. When I say ""we"" It's as a prospective member of the Church.

So admittedly something that played a part in my recent interest in Catholicism, was the actions of some US Bishops. (There are serious theological reasons too). The Vatican did not seem to stand behind, if not condemn their actions. Honestly, it hurt my feels a little bit. I'm conflicted because on one hand it seems a moral issue and question of faith but at the same time I can see why the church might want to steer clear of politics. 

Obviously we ought to be citizens of a country secondary to being members of the Church. How do we as Catholics reconcile our feelings when the Vatican does something we don't like? How do we follow the leadership of the Holy See, when it doesn't feel right?

Some issues feel like they are deeply moral and that there is only one right, Christian stance on an issue. How do we reconcile that?

How open should Catholic parents be about sex and puberty with their children?,SnakeAmethyst23,1620776237,"I grew up Catholic and in a somewhat social conservative household. I never had that kind of talk with my parents which I think is quite sad because that led me to have a poor understanding of my body and sexuality. For example, thanks to the internet, 9-year-old me randomly searched the female and male private parts on Google and then on Google images, and then onto Google videos. More than ten years later, I am now struggling with addiction to pornography. 

I think my parents viewed sex as a taboo subject in the house. For example, my dad would turn off the television when the show or movie we were watching get to the passionate kissing or sex scenes. Ironically, he had no problem with horror movies with me despite the gore and scary scenes. They even discouraged my older sister from having a boyfriend because of their fear of her getting pregnant. My mom instilled fear in my sister that should she ever get pregnant at a young age, she would never support her and her baby, which is ironic given how she's against abortion.

Why does God kill David's newborn son to punish David for his sons?,wyld_dear333,1620773346,"I'm listening to Day 130 of Fr Mike's Bible in a year podcast, and we're on the 2nd Book of Samuel Chapter 12, just after David slept with a married woman and then killed her husband and took her as his own wife. God then sent Nathan to him and Nathan said God was going to punish David and kill David's child (I'm assuming a young child like a newborn) . And sure enough, the child is sick and 7 days later the child days.

I'm trying really hard to see God's intention here and I don't see how this is a good thing. David sinned, yes, and I understand if God wants to bring that sin to light and for David to be saved, he has to endure something bad. But to kill his child, who had nothing to do with it? How is that right? How is this done out of goodness and love, and not out of anger? I see no love in killing an innocent child. 

I give so much credit to Fr Mike because anytime he comes across something in the Bible that God does that may seen questionable to the reader, he does such a good job of explaining God's angle. But he didn't address this one at all, which makes me think there is no good rebuttal or argument that what God did was right.

She was the one that offered my college and because coronavirus and the current situation in my country she's very busy (so many people need help and that's all they can get). The second one, though only listened me for half hour, made me some ""recommendations"" that goes against what I take for good. Has someone struggled with that? What did you do? I need someone who understands why the things I'm doing are important to me, why I keep doing them and can also help me with my anxiety. I'm opened to criticism, but I don't want to hear somebody whose recipe for my pains goes against the faith I'm trying to rebuild. I also went to confess (twice with the same priest). The first time I  thought the priest was too busy to hear me or at least to hear everything I wanted to say. The second time it gave me the feeling that I was being annoying, talking about my life and problems . I don't know if it's right to confess very often.",Catholicism
Need insight on scrupulosity.,CommanderCorncob,1620764813,"This was a comment I left on another post but I decided to make it into it’s own for the sake of visibility. Typing out my anxieties with my faith has made it evident that I could really use some wisdom. The following is the comment in full, and I will link the parent thread at the end of more context is needed.


From Wikipedia: “Scrupulosity is characterized by pathological guilt/anxiety about moral or religious issues. It is more commonly known as religious anxiety. It is personally distressing, objectively dysfunctional, and often accompanied by significant impairment in social functioning.”


I haven’t heard of this term before but I could not think of a more accurate description of my faith journey right now. Recently I’ve become genuinely invested in my faith, and while it’s enlightening, I’ve also never seen my life in such a woeful perspective before. I know that ultimately God is the only thing that matters, and that we should pledge unwavering loyalty to Him, but that ultimately calls to judgement everything I do in my everyday life. Everything I do seems sinful. I like to play video games to the point of excess depending on who you ask, I overeat for pleasure, and I occasionally relapse from a previous addiction with PMO. All I see is sloth, gluttony, and lust. This constant string of failures makes me think, “if I’m not a saint, why try at all?” Where is the line drawn between the sinner that God forgives, and the sinner that He doesn’t? 


People say that God accepts anyone who turns to Him. But if that were true, wouldn’t a sinner who accepted God on his death bed receive the same reward as a lifelong saint? If so, what is the point of excelling in your faith when the bare minimum is satisfactory? Naturally, this lead me to conclude that it depends on how genuine a person is with God, but “genuineness” cannot be objectively measured. Perhaps authenticity is binary, you are either authentic in your belief in God or you aren’t. I think about this a lot in the context of seeking forgiveness and the Sacrament of Reconciliation: “My sacrifice, O God, is a contrite spirit; a contrite, humbled heart, O God, you will not scorn.” Of course I believe that I am truly sorry before and after confession, but a month later (or even less) it is likely that I have already relapsed to almost all sins I’ve just confessed. So in the grand scheme of things, was I *truly* sorry? I promised to never sin again and avoid near occasions of sin yet I have broken that promise almost inevitably, so I guess not. But in the moment I truly believed it, I truly believed that I was sorry and that I would be forever loyal to God and his commandments henceforth. It would have been better for me to have died after confession than to live and see the reality of returning to sin. So in the short term I was sorry, but in the long term I returned to sin; does that mean my confession was genuine or not? I can’t even know my own authenticity at this point.


Therefore, the only logical conclusion I can come up with is that only God knows if I am genuine in my belief in Him. Only He can judge if I am worthy of Him, so the best course of action is to give my life an honest effort, and only God will know my fate at the end. But still, I am often kept up at night in despair.

But I had been feeling attraction for a person, because he was being intellectual with me and I find intelligence attractive, and I was connecting with him on an emotional level. I had been waiting eagerly for his replies as soon as I woke up and over last night. and due to the emotions, I had some unwanted inappropriate thoughts. I didn’t know whether what I was doing was wrong or not, so I prayed over it and decided I would just block the person (I previously followed him and was wanting to DM him) because I was hoping to have someone who could guide me spiritually, even though I feel this way by this type of person. 

I had felt this way about my priest too and decided to stop talking to him because if it. I briefly mentioned this to my therapist. 

At any rate, I’m not sure if I committed a mortal sin. I don’t want to sin or do anything wrong.

Now, I have no desire to lust, even though unwanted thoughts appear. I have no desire to pursue anything except for talking about the subjects I’m interested in. 


The problem is that when a male connects to me closely, I feel an attraction. This happened to my priest and I ended up not wanting to talk to him because of it. It’s happening to someone I talked to and now I don’t want to talk to them anymore because of it.

WHY INTEGRALISM (Confessional state) IS NOT CATHOLIC,WeWantTheBeast,1620750490,"
There are too many people who think that the elected government has to fix everything, but people have to fix themselves and their own families in order for there to be some measure of peace on earth. This is why Pope St. John Paul II constantly asked us to pray for Peace in the World. His successors Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis have continued this prayerful petition. Likewise it is our duty to do also, as well as implement it into the life of the Church in the World.

This brief article discusses the importance of the political in the broader context of the call to holiness of Christian Life. It briefly intends to illustrate the Church teaching that interior sanctity must come before exterior sanctifying action, not in the reverse. 


Integrism or Integralism is an ideology that originates from confusing the religious and the political aspects of social life, whereby you have the political order assimilated into the religious realm. Whilst it is clear to see the good intentions behind it-on face value it seems almost right in a Catholic's eyes- it is nonetheless a violation of the law of creation: That man was given freedom; and through free will, a certain level of autonomy. That he may freely choose God within himself. We the Church must never forget that our primary purpose is to aid in the begetting of adopted children of God through our evangelisation. This cannot be done without ""a sensitiveness towards humanity's desire for freedom and justice"" (+FJ Sheen)
and a witness in fraternal love for others. We cannot put our ""catholicity"" before our humanity. This is why ""The Dignity of the Human Person"" is the first principle of Catholic Social Doctrine. 

As Catholics, I think we tend to abstract the socio-political life from our broader universal call to holiness. This is false, as we are meant to infuse our political and social life with the Spirit of Truth. 

The political is concerned with right moral action. Cultivation of a habit of virtue through coercion might breed a practice of good moral action, but it does not necessarily make one virtuous, merely a 'follower of virtuous action'. As St Paul iterates in Rom 3:27 ""the law requires faith"", therefore, there is no salvation through the law alone. When Man has identified the Truth rationally, he must necessarily relate his heart and whole person to the Truth also; for the Truth is a Person (Jn 14:6) without Whom, we can have no eternal life.

The Church's role, indeed our role and especially those looking to engage into the Public Service and Governance, is to form an interior life in Christ first. A unity of life, in which we all are called in everything that we do to advance the earthly city and be a living witness to the Church and the person of Christ unto others. To have the disposition of a true and fulfilled moral happiness to do this necessitates an interior relationship with God. It is not limited to following the 'external' Church teaching merely from obedience. 

The Church exists ultimately for the salvation of the human race. This entails a unity of life interiorally oriented towards the good, so that we will have the right disposition to conduct our exterior affairs not just in accordance with Church teaching, but as a genuine reflection of the Person of Christ within us. Who we are influences others far more than our policies, however right they may be. Thus, the Church is primarily concerned with the Interior State, so that the exterior State may be influenced and transformed through good Christian men and women from within. We likewise influence the attitudes and persons of those without faith around us so that they too, can choose all that is good.


If the integralist model consists of an imposition of Catholic teaching from the perspective of the State, whereby the Church is actively determining law and order, however good and proper, society would relate to the Church as no more than a political entity imposing laws 'from above'. This is opposed to a religious and missionary Church bent on cultivating the good life 'from within' the individual through fraternal witness to the Truth and Love of Christ. 

There can never be a strict separation of Church and State. But this ""Church"" is not the institutional Church. It is the faithful persons of God, who through a unity of life and living in faithful devotion to the Magisterium's teaching, actively participate in the political life. This participation is not limited to inscribing Divine Law through sound and moral policies, but by influencing those ignorant around them to an encounter with Christ through their witness. That they might discover and liken to social policies that are good. That they may be inspired and not instructed to the moral life. 

Thus, our primary mission is both transcendent, looking up to the heavenly mission of the salvation of mankind, and imminent, cultivating and sanctifying ""the earthly city"" (Gaudium et Spes, 40). To sanctify the ""earthly city"" is a form of apostolate. Apostolate can only be achieved via a conversion from within.",Catholicism
A little thinking of me on the name of Jesus. It's possibly triune?,Eroldin,1620749868,"    I do not attempt try to go against the Holy Church, or do I try to state this is the truth. I only want to share some thoughts I had while meditating on the nature and names of God.

Our Lord, our God has been attributed many name in the Hebrew traditions.      
Some of them are widely known:

|El (God)|אֱלֹ|
|:-|:-|
|Elohim (gods - is plural except when it's used for the Lords name)|אֱלֹהִים|
|El Shaddai (God of the Mountain)|אֵל שַׁדַּי|
|Adonai (Lord)|אֲדֹנָי|
|YHWH (Yahweh, spoken by Hebrews as Adonai)|יהוה‎|
|Hashem (The Name)|רוח הקודש|
|Ruach Ha-kodesh (Holy Spirit - Holy Wind - Holy Breath)|רוח הקודש|

And starting from the New Testament:

|Yehushuah/Yeshua (Jesus)|יֵשׁוּעַ|
|:-|:-|


However, the name Jesus may contain a secret. No it's not something esoteric, or something magical.      
There is an unofficial way to write his name, while still maintaining the pronunciation; which shows that Yehushuah the Son is one with the Father and Holy Spirit:

|YHShWH (Yehushuah/Yeshua - Jesus)|יהשוה‎|
|:-|:-|


In this way of writing, the character Shin (Sh - pronounced as ""Sj"") has been added to the name YHWH, forming a pentagrammaton, a name with five characters. The character Sh means Shaddai, fire, or teeth and is attributed to the Holy Spirit. In this way of writing, the name of the Father (יהוה‎) combined, with the Hebrew character of the Holy Spirit (ש) became the name of the Son (יהשוה‎): Triune.

Again I like to point out, that this way of writing is NOT the official way to write the name of the Son.",Catholicism
Rejoice that your sins will be visible to all in heaven,fevich,1620748626,"I believe that at the time of our death, God's Truth will shed light on our whole being.

They are horror to you and I'm sorry to have offended you. But Lord, don't hide them. Let them be visible to all for all eternity. For they are proof that, without you, I am nothing but a fallen being who cannot choose to do Good even if its life depend on it.

Question about male purity during NFP abstinence,Gladiatorra,1620746726,"Hello all, my husband of 2 years and I are having some difficulty resulting from abstaining during times when we need to avoid pregnancy. Our parish priest hasn't offered any guidance to my husband in confession, so I thought I would see if any of you have advice to offer! Slightly NSFW language just due to the nature of the issue. 

Tldr: to what extent does a man need to take direct action to prevent an unintended ejaculation?

We are following the church's teaching on sexuality wholeheartedly: no contraception, he isn't masturbating, we are open to life. We have a 4 month old and need to avoid pregnancy for my health for the time being, which has resulted in extended periods when we can't come together as husband and wife. 

Usually this wouldn't be a moral problem as my husband's body would take care of things in his sleep. But lately (after a number of days of semi-arousal which results in discomfort and difficulty sleeping for him) he has been waking up right before his body ejaculates. There is enough time to prevent it if he would get up and move around. He says interrupting the process like that results in further discomfort for a few more days. If he doesn't take direct action, his body carries through. 

We're not doing anything to arouse him, so it's completely unintended, and any excess should be taken care of in his sleep, but his body hasn't let this happen. 

We're wondering if the double effect principle could be invoked, since he hasn't taken any action to cause his arousal, and doesn't intend any pleasure (and says that after so many days there is minimal pleasure anyways). He only intends the release of the built up pressure, and just wants to sleep soundly without his body bothering him. At the same time, it is an orgasm outside of intercourse.

Is he morally obligated to do everything he can to avoid it, or can he let his body take care of things?

Not as scarce as it seems,el_peregrino_mundial,1620742647,"I don't think the issue is as much one of scarcity as it seems, so much as it is an issue of interaction and multiplicity of potential options — if I look on a Catholic dating website, there are myriad people on there *in my area*, but I have not met almost any of them in real-world interactions, and since no human is perfect, we tend to keep looking for a closer-to-perfect-for-me option. But the fact that there are so many women and so many men (even within the same geographical area) struggling to find their future spouses indicates to me that it's less scarcity and more an issue of putting the hundred dudes with the hundred dames.

While COVID has exacerbated the problem, the same was true in 2019 &amp; before, too. After college, the cohort of people we associate with disperses tremendously in age group; whereas for most people college/university was constant interaction with people within 4-5 years of their age, the workplace ranges from 20 year-old interns to 65 year-old about-to-retires. On top of that the workplace-romance dynamic is a minefield fraught with ways things could go wrong, from the awkwardness of being turned down then having to work side by side, to the challenge of identifying potential partners without being able to so openly talk religion &amp; values, to the potential HR issues that could arise.

Parishes are better, but not great. Again the age dynamic comes in, because the Newman center crowd is mostly college students, and then you move to a normal parish and suddenly it's everyone from literally born-yesterdayers to funeral-next-weekers.

And age remains still just one factor. Parishes have some ministries, but with as busy as lives get, even if you and a potential future spouse are at the same parish and active in the ministerial life, there's a good chance you'll consistently just be at different mass times, different soup kitchen days, &amp;c.

Add on the paradox of choice: a hundred years ago, folks considered their pool of potential mates to probably be those within walking distance. Cars became more prevalent and accessible, and that pool of candidates expanded for each person. It then became normal to drive 20 miles for work, so why not for romance, and the pool expands further. Now with air travel and the Internet, subconsciously many people see the pool as being virtually worldwide, or at least nationwide. What that means is that every person you meet gets weighed against the seemingly infinite potential of someone more perfect for you. Because yes, while we understand that marriage is work, and it's difficult, and it can be a slog sometimes, ...

Blessing of the Suez Canal,jipac,1620742427,"*A World Beneath the Sands: The Golden Age of Egyptology,* by Toby Wilkinson, contains this description of the opening of the Suez Canal:

&gt;On 17 November 1869, five days of celebrations began with a great religious ceremony at Port Said. The Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria and the chaplain to the French imperial court... celebrated a Mass and a Te Deum. Then the Grand Mufti of Cairo and the clerics of al-Azhar read verses from the Qur'an and recited prayers to Allah.

Wilkinson may have been sloppy here -- Coptic Pope Demetrius II was present at the inauguration of the canal, but I can't find any confirmation that he actively participated. However, it is clear from some quick searches that there was both a Catholic Mass and Muslim prayer. There were also speeches by representatives of several religions. Monsignor Bernard Bauer, one of Empress Eugénie's confessors,

&gt;spoke after an imam and the Orthodox bishop of Jerusalem, expressing his hope that Christianity and Islam, two religions with common roots, but which had violently confronted each other historically, could be reconciled before this canal that united ""the splendid East and the marvelous West"". \[[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard\_Bauer](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Bauer)\]

Catholic Fiance - Orthodox me - Need Advice Please,OksanaAlexandra,1620740447,"Hello,

Please allow me to speak frankly. I mean no disrespect to the church. This is simply my situation. 

My fiance and I met almost two years ago and will soon be engaged for one year. His beliefs are part of Saint Pius X. We have been meeting with a priest and are waiting to apply for approval of our marriage ""disparity of cult/religion"" since I am Orthodox. If I'm being completely honest I used to call myself ""Orthod-atheist"" because although I felt spiritually religious with Orthodoxy, there was also a part of me that didn't believe in God. 

I am not the most religious person now, and have been trying hard to find my path and open up. I have done readings and research. I ask questions. And I can say I have come leaps and bounds from where I have started. That being said (and I made it clear to my partner) that it may take me years to get to a strong God-loving place, or it may never happen. I find myself more spiritual and honestly have a hard time believing some of the more strict aspects of devout Christianity.

Herein the issue: I have already gone through so many hurdles to make this work in the religious sense. I didn't even ever want to get married in a church. But I have agreed to do all of this and try for him. It breaks my heart to know that my only sibling will not be allowed to be a godparent for my children - amongst other things. And now, my fiance just met with the priest and has told us that since we live together we will not be approved for our marriage. That we need to live separately. And honestly this to me is like the straw that broke the camels back.

We already do and have lived together for almost 2 years! We are almost 30! And now we have to live separately? This isn't centuries ago or even a century ago when people got married young. I feel like living together is one of the greatest tests to prepare for marriage. So many couples break up after moving in together - but we have not, we are stronger. As well in this economy and with Covid and the wedding and other things, we now have to essentially throw away money for this? I'm so lost and confused and heart broken. Every time I try and do more and more and be more patient and am told ""just one more thing"" this is ""one last hurdle"" - it never is!! 

I love him so much but this is getting to the point where it feels like who I am, what I believe in and what I don't are all but erased. No, it's not the worst thing in the world but also all of my friends and family (and I can't tell them about this) feel the same way as me but even more strongly. And if I tell them, they would almost certainly all tell me to leave.

I need advice, but PLEASE ... I cannot handle ""this is God's will"" or any biblical stories - At this point things like that will push me over the edge. Does anyone have similar situations?  I am so over it but there's a part of me that wants to be okay with it but the two just can't come to an agreement. I feel so anxious, unhappy and torn over the situation. 

I'm not trying to be dramatic but I have already swayed and changed and made like 70% of the journey towards him and his beliefs and I feel like I don't and can't even get 1%. That seems so unfair. Love... there should be compromise. I don't know what to do or say. May this all just sounds ridiculous.

Interesting discussion on revelation.,DependentShirt8089,1620739444,"I read all of revelation (though it was long ago) and obviously there is a lot of symbols and no real concrete answers.  However, what seems consistent is the persecution of Christians.  Seems like great tragedies will come upon us.

I guess my question follows any other case of martyrdom really.  Are we allowed to take up arms and fight back against people trying to harm us because of our beliefs.  I’m not saying against people that disagree with us, but revelation style were people want to kill us. I know Christ and a lot of the saints decided against action against their abusers.  I feel Christ had to do what he did, and saints just followed his example.  But is it intrinsically evil to fight against the oppression with violence?  No different than what the military asks of their members in combat and the church recognizes this as ok.

I just don’t want to go down standing there as my family and I get slaughtered for believing in Christ.  I’d rather go down fighting backend protecting my wife and kids as long as I could.",Catholicism

"Since the crucifixion is an event outside of time, does that explain why so many pagan myths resemble the story of Jesus Christ?",InternationalRice728,1620737836,"I'm not catholic, not even christian, but I read an explanation of the presence of Christ in the echarist by a bishop. As far as I understood, the bread and wine is transubstantiated during mass because of Jesus' death on the cross. Because this event is both in time (it happened roughly 2000 years ago) and outside of time (not possible to place the event on a timeline) the transubstantiation can happened during mass again and again because the crucifixion is always happening. 

I'm not sure if I understood it completely, but my point of this post is to ask about the crucifixion's outside-of-time-ness. Is this eternality of the crucifixion something that enables people living before Jesus to sense the event? 

Historians have drawn parallels between the story of Christ and other myths. For example Mithras who is resurrected, Dionysos who went to the underworld, and apparantly was tried for claiming divinity in the greek tragedy Bacchae. Are these similarites explained by the crucifixion happening outside of time?

Thoughts on reincarnation under the sect of Catholicism,Finding-User,1620735090,"I know Catholic don’t believe in reincarnation.

So, yes... I know it’s not believed in. It’s like a Catholic also being a Wiccan, lol. Probably not likely... because it’s the complete opposite. But, I hope I make some sense.

A Catholic who wants to be Catholic but isn't sure what that means anymore,pinkyelloworange,1620726178,"  
**The speel that will sound heretical but fundamentally explains why I still want to be Catholic despite significant disgust with the institution**

I can't say that I intellectually agree with the official position on things like sexual morality. That is in some way a symptom. The underlying issue is different: I believe that the Church has historically abused its authority. Not just individuals mucking up, no, I believe that there were multiple sustained instances of institutional abuse. I do believe in authority, I do believe she has *some* authority granted to her by Jesus, but I also believe in what Jesus said about authority ""do not be as the Gentiles who lord it over them"".  I believe that the church is a bit like Israel. We can fuck up big time, but it never was up to us. The Church has historically changed its attitude on things. Had you and I been born in a different era, we might've believed very different things about usury, slavery (God forbid), persecuting heretics and non-Christians (also God forbid, what a monstruosity), and we would have probabaly believed there were certain books that would make us incurr mortal sin by reading them (another example of abuse of church authority. How could anybody think that she has the divine given authority to do something so abusive and illberal?). We would've believed, due to the preserving mentality of the time, due to *perceived* orthodoxy (not actual orthodoxy) certain things that we abhor today. So my question is, why couldn't we be wrong about homosexuality in the same way? (to give an example). Heck, theologians disagree about what is and isn't an infallibaly defined teaching (universal ordinary magisterium and all that). Even without that, we still have to struggle with drawing the line, what is the limit to this authority? Some of it exists, otherwise half of us would still be Arians, but it isn't unlimited, otherwise we'd have to say that there really was a list of books that it was mortally sinful to read.  


**More ""liberal"" side of me:**  


Rationally I cannot see anything wrong with these actions. Trying to pretend that I do has caused me cognitive dissonance and I do not think it's been good, or that this state is sustainable. In short, acting more or less by following what my rational mind is telling me seems like a good shout. There is no ""safe"" side. If I'm wrong about homosexuality now I'm leading people into sin, if I was wrong before I was leading people away from Christ by imposing uneccessary burdens.  


**More ""conservative"" side:**  


It will sound sentimental, but I miss something, I miss him. I've always missed him, even when I've been more conservative and tried to convince myself to believe things that I don't. He is the first person that's ever made me cry from feeling so loved and so warm (followed by my parents, a select few friends and eventually my boyfriend). I don't want to be away from him. I'm human and in a fallen state, which means that I am and will always be (as long as I live in this world), to some extent, a hedonist. However, I feel gratefulness and attachment to him, sometimes longing, he makes me happy and I also fundamentally believe in montheism, the Gospels, the incarnation, the ressurection, all that, and I believe that he knows the best way to live. Because I'm so terrified of losing him, of becoming indifferent to him, of somehow going away, wouldn't it be best to lean on the ""safe"" side?",Catholicism

then I Segway into my prayers I learned: the our father, the Hail Mary, the glory be, the act of contrition, the bless us oh lord and these thy gifts, and in the past 3 years I’ve added the apostles creed. at some point I’m going to add the beatitudes and every other prayer on the back or front of my Bible.

The priesthood is a *supernatural* gift, not naturally due to anybody via human effort and qualifications, and God has gifted it to men.

But a thought just occurred to me: is it possible that God *could* have gifted it to women, or is the nature of the sexes such that this would not be fitting, or would even be ontologically impossible? 

After all, God chose to restrict the Levitical priesthood to the nation of Israel, but I don't see any reason why He couldn't have chosen the Swedish, the Maya, the Pashtuns, and so on (Perhaps, not the Koreans though, because they are already the Choson People 🥁).

Cry rooms,Proof-Major,1620708211,"So partly venting, partly soliciting opinions.  I took my wife and 10 month old son to mass the first time at our new parish this week since we just moved. 

We checked the parish website which had the latest bulletin.  We needed to go to confession and the bulletin listed 45 minutes of confession before each mass We arrived 1 hour early and got in line at the confessional.  The pastor walked by in an alb and cincture about 30 minutes before mass and waved at us but never came back. We waited till a bell signaled the entrance procession so we grabbed a spot in the nearest pew. We were glared at from multiple directions all the way up till the homily when an usher offered to show us where the cry room was. We took to be a not so subtle hint that babies are not welcome in the main congregation.  

Up to that point my son had not cried at all but to give the people around us credit he was babbling a lot and moving around a lot. I'm sure it was a distraction. 


The cry room was a 15x15 jam packed with five families with babies , toddlers and strollers. The speaker in that room was broken and crackling, and the window onto the main church was filthy.  No one came in to take collection I had to walk back out to an usher to offer my sacrifice.  Felt like total outcasts/afterthoughts.  

My old parish doesn't have a cry room, most of the young families go to the 1pm mass and we just felt more welcome there.  I intend to go back but I feel like any one or two of those things are understandable but all together are a problem.  After that reception I am tempted to drive an hour and half to attend mass at our old parish going forward.  

For what it's worth the average parishioner there as far as I could tell was a 60 year old woman. There were a few families with teenagers but everyone with kids under three were in the cryroom with us.

Help explaining the Faith,Howbeautifulthefaith,1620706797,"I just got through a really draining conversation with my mom, and I need your guy's advice. So my moms a non catholic christian, and she was asking me about confession. I told her about John 20:23, ""whosoever sins you remit,"" how that authority was transferred from the Apostles to the early church, etc. Her main sticking point was ""how could God be so narrow as to only create one way to be forgiven, and for that way to be through another person?"" I explained to her that Catholics place no limit on God's mercy, that He can forgive whoever He wants, but that we do confession because that is the sure way He gave us of obtaining that forgiveness. I said that the main issue here is authority, if you believe that Church was set up by Jesus you accept confession. She said she can't see how it was set up, with all the corruption throughout the years, all the ""arbitrary"" rules, etc. I tried my best to explain that the Church is a hospital for sinners, that everyone falls short, that the rules are for people's good and spiritual advancement. She still went back to, ""why can't people just encounter God by themselves?""

Now this really gets down to an experience of hers when she used to be a Catholic, which we have talked about, and talked about today. She got married outside of the church, and when she went to confession, the Priest rightfully refused the absolvement unless she promised to not have relations outside of the Church's marriage. This embarrassed and emotionally hurt her sensitive soul, and that was the last time she entered a confessional. So I tried to be diplomatic, and gently explain how the Church insists on defining marriage for the good of people and the sacrament, and how nothing was refused to her, it was her refusing to give up that practice that ""retained"" the sin of that practice. Again she was just deeply hurt by it, and has such a roadblock in her mind because of that.

Also, her father and all his family are catholic, and he fought constantly with her mom, who is a Jehovah's Witness, over religion. So that's a whole more lot of baggage. She said that if Catholicism is true, why do so many Catholics she knows behave so badly?

So what I'm trying to get at, is I need advice on how to evangelize to someone who has a large amount of painful emotional baggage against the Church. It doesn't make it any better that I'm not very good at dealing with emotion, and would much prefer if her objections were doctrinal in nature, instead of emotional.

"""Proper"" burial and honouring ""dishonourable"" parents",Informal-Amphibian-4,1620704803,"Let's pretend this is a hypothetical question. Let's pretend someone grew up in an abusive and neglectful home and was ostracised by their family. As an adult the child tries to repair their family and help them change. It works alright but the family sometimes still falls into their toxic and dysfunctional ways  and the relationships are still tense and strained. Then the parents die. The catholic would be tasked to honour their parents and give them a ""proper"" burial. 

1) What does a ""proper"" burial mean? A nice funeral? A casket and formal burial? Is it okay to let the government take away their bodies and do who-knows-what with them? What if we cannot afford a ""proper"" burial? I work a low income dead-end job whereas my sibling makes much more but isn't going to help with expenses. I cannot afford funerals. I'm not even sure I could afford a cheap casket. I can barely afford my bills. Seeing as my sibling won't even speak to me regarding potential funeral arrangements for our parents who will eventually pass, I will probably be stuck being responsible for everything. What makes a burial honourable or dishounourable? What am I obligated to do? (My parents are not catholic and would not want a catholic burial/mass.) 

2) Come to think of it, I'm not sure how many people would attend. I'm sure my parents had friends at some point in their lives but many are scattered across the globe and they haven't spoken in years even decades. Some lost touch and no one has heard anything since. I wouldn't even know who they are or how to find them.

3) My only sibling has expressed that they will not attend their funerals if they had one. That leaves the responsibility on me. I don't *want* to be responsible but I'd guess that I could be pressured into it more easily than my sibling because I'd have a guilty conscience if I didn't and I'd be afraid of going to hell for it. (My sibling has no religion so they would not feel a moral obligation.) Ironically my sibling was the cherished child so more than anyone else they'd be able to speak to their good qualities firsthand. But no such luck.

4) The eulogies. Since my sibling would not even attend that means I'm stuck doing this part too. Of all the points I listed this is probably the hardest part. I know funerals are for the living and not the truth and you're supposed to talk about how the deceased is such a great person / parent and how much they mean to you. Part of it is my personality. I hate flattery and can't stomach saying these kind of things about anyone if they're false. Words of affirmation is not my love language but it is my sibling's. I don't want to be uncharitable but I just don't have it in me. I don't want to say anything disparaging or fall into detraction and I wish I had the heart to be more charitable but I can't bring myself to do it. Want me to pay for nice funerals? Fine. I'll even go all out and maybe hope you enjoy the party in spirit. Nice caskets? Fine. Want me to scour the globe looking for your long-lost friends and harangue them to come? Fine. I'm even willing to *act* like you were great parents and people nonverbally but I cannot bring myself to say words that at best leave a gnawing empty sadness and at worst taste like vomit. Even words or compliments that have double meanings leave me feeling like I'm being cut with swords of ice. I did that my entire life and it ruined me in many ways. I'm more willing to do anything else on this list but this is one thing I struggle with. I'm completely on board with ""if you can't say anything nice then don't say anything at all"" but not saying anything is just as bad in this case. So are a bunch of vague, overly cheesy platitudes that are obviously insincere.

(Politics Monday) On denying Holy Communion to those in mortal sin,tastypasta18,1620704016,"Canon 915 reads: “Those who have been excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty and others obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion.”

I absolutely believe that, in accordance with this, pro-choice politicians and all others clearly and persistently supporting abortion should be counseled to not receive the Eucharist and denied the sacrament if necessary. However, we should make sure that we are consistent with this and not only applying it to the issue of abortion, making it appear to many that the Eucharist is being used as a political weapon. The same should apply to any and all mortal sins, including but not limited to the following:

- Wishing or imposing evil on anyone
- Missing Sunday Mass
- Failing to fast or abstain on prescribed days
- Performing unnecessary work on Sundays
- Theft (sometimes)
- Gossip (sometimes)
- Lying (sometimes)
- Conscious racism
- Cheating and unfair wagers
- Detraction
- Encouraging grave sins or vices
- Scandal
- Blasphemy, sacrilege and profanity
- Heresy or apostasy
- Divorce and remarriage
- Endangerment of others
- Freemasonry
- Extreme anger and envy
- Magic and sorcery
- Schism
- Simony
- Terrorism
- Sexual sins and disordered unions
- Oppression of the poor
- Injustice to the wage earner

In accordance with the canon, this is only the case if said sins are obstinate (deliberate), continuous and manifest (very clear). Parish priests should not be going out of their way looking for reasons to deny Communion, but they shouldn’t be looking for reasons not to deny it either.",Catholicism

I know this is a serious penalty but these clergymen are openly leading and teaching against GOD’S will. While I will not speak ill of his Holiness, Rome needs to take a firm stance against heresy.

But first, I don't want to waste the time of others if it has only been a few days since my last confession; and second, I have been falling into habitual mortal sin for the past year.
2. I would try fasting again, and have done so, but now it is Easter season and as far as I understand we're not allowed to fast during Easter season?
3. Do you have any advice for conquering habitual mortal sin? Because there is a priest on the Internet who says, ""HOW ABOUT DON'T DO IT, MORON!"" But as much as I hate to admit it, this is much easier said than done. I still pray a few Rosaries per day and do my spiritual reading.

Is it okay to be married and not have children?,Xeno-Bound,1620692449,"First, I would like to preface this by saying that I’m not Catholic, but have been thinking a lot about it. This question will also only apply to straight couples, since I already know gay marriage is seen as sinful.

Normally, the answer I would see to my question would be “yes”. Having children is a huge responsibility, and it’s a responsibility that people bring upon themselves, intentionally or not. For those who do wish to have children, that is a good thing, and I am glad that you feel called to do so. But if you don’t feel called to have kids, even when you’re married, is it fair to say that it’s a wrong decision?

However, when looking at the Church, I’ve often seen a lot of people against the idea of not having kids even when married. It’s as if you either get married and have a family, or you remain celibate. If a person doesn’t want to have children, why should that be a reason not to pursue a romantic relationship? 

This question also applies to me personally. In a previous post I’ve made, I’ve said that I have Asperger’s Syndrome, and form of autism. My brother also has autism (his is less functioning than mine), which has led me to the possibility that I may have received it through genetics. I don’t know if I want to risk having a child go through unnecessary pain and hardship if I can prevent it from happening. 

Now, as I said before, having children is a great thing. Bringing new life into the world is a great blessing for many. But if you can only have a relationship if you plan to have children, that doesn’t seem like much of a blessing, but an obligation. I wanted some clarity to see if these principles are what the church holds. Thank you.",Catholicism

"How do you guys interpret Hebrews 4:10? To me it seems to affirm the 4th commandment (as the 7th day), making 10/10 commandments repeated in the NT and not just 9/10.",AhavaEkklesia,1620689022,"I asked essentially the same question over at /r/truechristian as well, and I wanted to hear your guys thoughts too.

Hebrews 4

&gt;4For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: “**On the seventh day God rested from all his works.**

&gt;9There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;

&gt;10 for anyone who enters God’s rest  **also rests** from their works, **just as God did from his.**


So Hebrews 4:10 is what I'm asking about, It says that once we enter God's rest of accepting Jesus (I agree Jesus is God's' rest for us), we **also** rest from our works ""just as God did from his"". ""Also"" is a keyword there.

To rest ""just as God did"" is not to rest from sin, God does not rest from sin, God rested from his creative ""work"" on the 7th day.

Many of us interpret that to keep the 4th commandment sabbath day, which is the ""seventh day""(which would make all 10 commands affirmed in the NT, not only 9).

---- 
-----

To be extra clear,
I agree that the 1st rest mentioned below is accepting Jesus and resting in him from your works. 

&gt;&gt;10 for anyone who enters God’s rest..

This says you enter God's rest of accepting Jesus. But it goes on to say...

&gt;&gt;10 for anyone who enters God’s rest  **also rests** from their works, **just as God did from his.**


but then you **""also""** rest ""just as God did"". How do you interpret this second rest described as resting just as God did?

So because the 7th day is in the context of Hebrews 4, I have good reason to want to keep the 7th day instead of 1st day?

O Lord Jesus Christ Who, before ascending into heaven did promise to send the Holy Spirit to finish Your work in the souls of Your Apostles and Disciples, deign to grant the same Holy Spirit to me that He may perfect in my soul, the work of Your grace and Your love. Grant me the Spirit of Wisdom that I may despise the perishable things of this world and aspire only after the things that are eternal, the Spirit of Understanding to enlighten my mind with the light of Your divine truth, the Spirit of Counsel that I may ever choose the surest way of pleasing God and gaining heaven, the Spirit of Fortitude that I may bear my cross with You and that I may overcome with courage all the obstacles that oppose my salvation, the Spirit of Knowledge that I may know God and know myself and grow perfect in the science of the Saints, the Spirit of Piety that I may find the service of God sweet and amiable, and the Spirit of Fear that I may be filled with a loving reverence towards God and may dread in any way to displease Him. Mark me, dear Lord, with the sign of Your true disciples and animate me in all things with Your Spirit. Amen.

ACT OF CONSECRATION TO THE HOLY SPIRIT

On my knees before the great multitude of heavenly witnesses, I offer myself, soul and body to You, Eternal Spirit of God. I adore the brightness of Your purity, the unerring keenness of Your justice, and the might of Your love. You are the Strength and Light of my soul. In You I live and move and am. I desire never to grieve You by unfaithfulness to grace and I pray with all my heart to be kept from the smallest sin against You. Mercifully guard my every thought and grant that I may always watch for Your light, and listen to Your voice, and follow Your gracious inspirations. I cling to You and give myself to You and ask You, by Your compassion to watch over me in my weakness. Holding the pierced Feet of Jesus and looking at His Five Wounds, and trusting in His Precious Blood and adoring His opened Side and stricken Heart, I implore You, Adorable Spirit, Helper of my infirmity, to keep me in Your grace that I may never sin against You. Give me grace, O Holy Spirit, Spirit of the Father and the Son to say to You always and everywhere, ""Speak Lord for Your servant heareth."" Amen.

Catholic response to catcalling,Propria-Manu,1620681227,"Recently married, didn't realize until several months ago how bad it is for a woman to go out in her day to day life especially if she is attractive. My wife came home very upset because when she was out grocery shopping, a man invaded her personal space and said obscene things to her. I hate that she is subjected to this and did not realize the extent to which it can go on a frequent basis. She dresses very modestly and to think that a man approaches a woman to do that infuriates me, much less the future mother of my kids.

I offered to go with her from now on should she need to go grocery shopping, as it seems to me the most practical solution. However yesterday she was still approached by a man who aggressively made comments about her body and what he wanted to do to her, I was livid and started swearing at him. it could have escalated further if it were in a less crowded area.

The advantages of having Catholicism as our state religion and it being guaranteed by the constitution.,zogins,1620678569,"Very few countries have a clause in their constitution such as Malta (small EU nation) has:  

**Article 2 of the** [**Constitution of Malta**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Malta)  **states that the religion of Malta is the ""Roman Catholic apostolic  religion"" (paragraph 1), that the authorities of the Catholic Church  have the duty and the right to teach which principles are right and  wrong (paragraph 2) and that religious teaching of the Catholic  apostolic faith shall be provided in all state schools as part of  compulsory education (paragraph 3).**  

Secular Humanists and atheists are trying to get this article removed from our constitution. However this part of the constitution protects people of all faiths (including atheists). The Catholic church does not interfere with our democratic processes, it prevents persecution of people of ANY faith and maintains our centuries old traditions and culture. With increasing Muslims in Europe we are seeing requests to remove Crucifixes from classrooms, hospitals and government buildings because they are deemed 'offensive'. This is the thin end of the wedge so having a constitution that protects a mature, wise and tolerant religion is the best protection for our democratic culture.",Catholicism

Very liturgical, very moving, the music and production quality are unbelievable and the preaching is also pretty good. I’ve looked at Catholicism before, and while I agree with pretty much everything in the Catechism, I have found myself unmoved when attending local Catholic masses. I’ve noticed that masses at the regular neighborhood churches are not like the masses at the Basilica. I know that most regular churches don’t hire professional musicians etc. but the local masses tend to be way shorter, and kind of less “churchy”. Can anyone explain to me the reasons for this?

An experience with boomer Catholics left me throttled. I had no idea it could get this bad.,Catholic_Worker93,1620669665,"So, as my name implies, I’m heavily involved with the Catholic Worker movement and have been for years. I recently got the opportunity to live rent free in a non-profit house of ours, in a communal living situation. This was great, as I recently had lost my car from a bad accident. 

There was even a Catholic church nearby that was a mere minutes walk away. Which was great. Or so I thought. 

I went there and knelt and started praying before Mass. The congregation is almost exclusively white baby boomers.  

These three boomers in front of me were laughing and cutting up like school yard children. It was so loud I had to ask them to please keep quiet, that people were trying to pray (that and we are in the presence of Our Lord). They looked at me as if I shot their grandkids. 

Mass starts. Phew. From listening to and watching the priest, it’s clear he either encourages or facilitates this stuff. During the Preparation of the Gifts, he said, “Sisters and brothers”. He took potshots at the “institutional Church” in his homily, made snide remarks about the Bishops, and accused traditional Catholics of treating the Church as a god (outright straw man). 

The parishioners all did the Orans pose, some held up hands like a football referee. The sign of peace was like an extended social. I kept my hands folded and head bowed during the prayers. 

After Mass, I was leaving the building and an older woman came up to me and gave me a tongue lashing. Said I was not “participating” because Mass is a “community celebration” and that my lack of matching the priests movements shows arrogance. I was mortified. I’m just trying to show humility and reverence in the presence of Jesus Christ. 

This priest also doesn’t even hold Confessions either. I have to walk 4 miles to the next parish or get a ride there.

It is undeniable that there was a point in history when the church was plagued with corruption and so on. There where popes who where horrible people, and even the church tortured and burned people at the stake. And it's not that these things where okay according to Catholicism, since Popes have apologized for them. Like Pope john Paul II apologized for the Church's role in burnings at the stake.

So, I am a former atheist. I was raised in a non-denominational Christian home and became an atheist later on. I was far from the Roman Church, and I did not understand a lot of important material. Religion started to seem silly to me, and I started becoming convinced in my own ignorance.

Thanks to God, I saw the truth and became a Christian again, but I was still unfamiliar enough with Roman Catholicism to make the jump. Reddit played an important role in having my questions answered, and I am happy to report that I am a Catholic now.

I am not simply a Catholic who believes. I also do actively try to push arguments in favor of God and Catholic philosophy.

Unfortunately, Reddit ~~never~~ does not always prize reasoned arguments. That is why I think it is important for us to have a neutral space for debating philosophy, that is not focused on blocking anyone who disagrees.

That is why I currently head the subreddit known as [r/DebatePhilosophers](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/DebatePhilosophers/). I make daily posts there about the foundations of our faith and try to engage people.

I am a source for those who want real truth and not those who only want their weaknesses validated by reaffirming lies that comfort them,whatwouldsatando997,1620659991,"The new testament has a main objective of thwarting the  threat of those who followed Paul and Peter in a non obtrusive way. Matthew 16:23 is a key scripture in that. 

During the contemporary period Paul writing from jail for breaking Roman law was seen by many as appalling because even Jesus respected the 'when in Rome standard (eventually, as poeticized as him saying 'what's for Caesar is Caesar's because if one has a job then they have a job and Mathew being so awesome and professional subliminally got him to respect taxes). To not respect the country you're in when there's no unreasonable treatment laid out by the laws, was a sickening act. For Peter and Paul to openly talk and plan on harassing people who weren't Jewish already and have lived full lives not naturally going to the religions of the Abrahamic tree, was supposed to sabotage them as pure evil....it 😉attracts evil because evil has urges to dominate and force others to do what they do without deeper concern of who the person is and where they come from as a person. It is many ways to serve God and focusing on how many are doing the same as you is pure evil and disrespects others not hurting anyone. 

It is beautiful if someone finds nontoxic spiritual peace in anyway even if it's being a Satanist. That's far better than burning innocents as witches under the name of Jesus. The wrong is only bringing ego and protecting weakness and pursuit of power in to matters of God and Peter did all of that. Paul was scammed and couldn't figure that out because he was far from a finished product. He was too over zealous in killing the criminal Chriatians breaking the law and when Peter schemed to have him as a convert using knowledge of infections and cures that Jesus was exposed to during his long education, Paul was Gung ho about serving Jesus to an over zealous level. He reminds me of Uriah from the book of Samuel, who wanted to win brownie points for not listening and having sex with his wife because he was simple and over concerned about sex which is just a meaningless body function. Paul thought showing love for God was related to showing how hard you will hurt others hurting God and how hard you will force others to serve God because he was overcompensating personal growth of toxic flaws with winning brownie points by showing he was better than others. 

God judges based only on personal strength. Only self motivation without need for reward. That leaves only pure understanding and knowing because of being a real person with a loving soul. People are not capable of evil. We are not capable of hurting others to protect weaknesses we can't fix and they did not cause. A Human beast can easily do that though. 

At worse people would have growing opportunities but because they do not affect others, those are not the true transgressions because the nature of time exists for POTENTIAL progression as time passes. So at any future point a good person would always be better than they were in the past by growing and pushing their self. That potential is earned by the power of the soul from heaven being stronger than the weak fleshly vessel. 

The soulless prove their evil by the inability to understand. They live with facades but are always exposed because the one thing you can't fake is being smart. So they will attack people like dogs chasing squirrels for their master for issues that don't affect others like drugs or homosexuality and use serpent like cunningness to claim the actions of others within the attacked groups justifies them....all while ignoring the wrong in over generalizing an individual and taking away due process. So that is a grass cutting technique to reveal snales (you can never fix thembbecause evil can not be fixed. Just cause they have the same flesh they are not the same inside and nit the same to God so you should not be simple minded and judge on surface things like them being human or them being the same race or same sex. Only judge the self motive and ability to lie and have to be forced to act right because they are too weak to be a stand up person and accept consequences for ego driven errors on others).

Do not allow evil to think it can cheapen the reward of heaven by allowing ego and sin. These things want their weaknesses excused and are so bold in mistakes they do not feel shame for being unable to achieve. Think about it. When Jesus says the meek shall inherit the Earth it is about those who are meek in mistakes. Being meek in mistakes is feeling shame rightfully and not crying for yourself to the point of getting false confidence to the point of feeling so entitled to be weak you attack others and the world to not feel the pain of lacking strength of soul to overcome all weakness.

Animals lack strength a soul and hit a growth plateau they can never break free from. After that they do the evil stuff like pee for territory or as in monkeys, throw feces at others who did not cause their insecurity and need for dominance. Again, it happens because when they lack a soul they have to attack the world and others because they can not attack their weaknesses to level up like a real person with a soul.

"Struggling to understand Paul's exhortation on celibacy, can anyone provide clarity?",Seethi110,1620658855," 1 Corinthians 7:8-9 RSV (Catholic)

&gt;*But if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry, since it is better to be married than to be burnt up.*

It sounds like Paul is saying ""If you can't control yourself, you should get married.  But if you can control yourself, you should be celibate"".  That may be an oversimplification of how vocations work, but it seems to be exactly what Paul is saying.

Here are my questions/concerns:

* Would it really be good for the world if a requirement for Catholic marriage was that you have been living a sexually immoral lifestyle and need an outlet via marriage?
* I'm a virgin who has never watched porn or masturbated, but I still have a sexual drive and a strong desire for marriage.  Is Paul saying I should remain single since I've proven that I could remain celibate?  
* Given the first two questions, isn't this almost like punishing those who have been obedient to the Church's teaching on sex, while rewarding those who haven't been obedient by providing an outlet for them?
* Lastly, isn't it silly to say that some people are capable of celibacy and others are not?  Couldn't anyone be celibate with the grace of God?",Catholicism

Msgr. Darwin Andino: “Honduras has never had Catholic presidents; all presidents have been Freemasons”,Soldier_ofthe_Cross,1620654065,"In 2019, Msgr. Darwin Andino, the Bishop of Santa Rosa de Copán, stated in a sermon that Honduras has never had a president that was more than a Catholic in name only, and that all of the nation’s presidents have been Freemasons or have had Masonic connections. It is important to note that the nation’s most celebrated statesman is Francisco Morazán, who has a Freemason. Bishop Andino went on to call Freemasonry an enemy of the Church.

These claims are particularly jarring considering that levels of income inequality in Honduras are higher than in any other Latin American country, the political and economic power there is in the hands of a few at the expense of many, and that the number of Protestants in the nation almost surpasses the number of Catholics there.

The vaccine and concerns with Catholics,DependentShirt8089,1620653674,"I’m not a conspiracy theorist but I’m a bit concerned about the full on push to get this vaccine.  I know a handful of people that have died after the vaccine.  No way to prove that was the vaccine, but it makes you wonder.  The church leaders are pushing something that doesn’t even have approval by the CDC (outside emergency use).  If you look at the rate at which people die it’s less than %2 if you get the virus. Why doesn’t the church encourage people to not be obese, stop smoking, and generally take care of their temple.  Studies show that people in the aforementioned categories and the elderly are the ones at risk.

Catholic sexual ethics make so much sense,AstronomerOk4608,1620652979,"I was talking to my protestant aunt and cousin, and they were shaming these young women at our old baptist church who became single moms. At the baptist church, the pastor would tell the young people to refrain from having pre-marital sex and that they shouldn't use contraception because that would just increase the chances of falling into temptation. As a result, there were a handful of young women who became pregnant and their boyfriends left them. My cousin said that these women should have used birth control. My aunt said, ""I'm so proud of my daughter (my cousin) who has never been pregnant and she now has a great career."" My aunt knows that my cousin is regularly having sex with her boyfriend and with her past boyfriends, and that she's on birth control. I was thinking: how is my cousin any different from the young women who became single moms? They were both having pre-marital sex, my cousin just used birth control. 

I'd like to point out that I'm no better -- I regularly engaged in pre-marital and casual sex before my conversion to catholicism, and I used contraception. 

Now my aunt and my cousin know that I am a catholic and I don't use birth control in my marriage. They think I'm nuts for it. 

When I learned about theology of the body, I was absolutely mind blown. Contraception is the root cause of so many dysfunctional relationships, and the breakdown of families of marriages. 

When you remove the procreative element of sex, why should you have to wait until marriage to have sex? Because God said so? But why? Protestants don't have an answer to this, except that it says in the Bible that we should abstain from sexual immorality. Even then, they are unsure what sexual immorality really means. 

Babies are now seen as accidents, as burdens, instead of as the natural fruit of sex. 

In the past before the sexual revolution, when a man said, ""I want to have sex with you"" it meant ""I want to start a family with you"". Now when a man says, ""I want to have sex with you"", it means ""you're hot and I want you to make me orgasm"".

Men and women today are using each other for their own sexual pleasure. The MeToo movement is especially telling of how hurt women are today, as a result of the sexual revolution. The incel movement is built on men thinking they have the right to have sex with women. Porn addiction is rampant across the board, further perpetuating poisonous ideas on sex and love, and fuelling human trafficking. Women are hurting themselves with birth control (have you seen the effects of birth control on a woman's body???), in the name of having no-strings-attached sex. Women are getting their tubes tied so that their husbands can enjoy ""consequence-free"" sex. Abortion is seen as a human right, because we need a backup in case birth control fails. Marriage is no longer seen as basis of society, but as a mere piece of paper. Men and women will say that they aren't ready for marriage, but they were ready to start having sex when they were just 14 years old? Men and women no longer find ""vanilla sex"" fun, and they need to go to extreme lengths to keep the ""passion"" going (i.e. look at BDSM, polyamory, sex toys, kinks, etc.). 

I always hear men and women blaming the other sex for how dysfunctional the dating world is. The problem isn't men or women -- it's that men and women do not know who they are anymore. They do not even know what sex is, they think that sex is just some ""fun, consensual activity you do with another adult(s)"". 

I truly think that theology of the body could heal and save so many people. It's too bad that as soon as people (protestants included!) hear that it's a ""catholic teaching"", they immediately do not want to listen.",Catholicism

Query about Divine Office using iBreviary app,LatrinaWimbush,1620644676,"Hello,

I have just watched an instructional video on how to pray the Divine Office using the iBreviary app. I have a few questions though I was hoping somebody could answer for me (these are mostly confirmations I have understood what to do). This is to pray alone. Note I am a very new Catholic (entered the Church this year as a convert) so this is all slightly foreign to me. 

1) If praying alone what do you do about the Hymn? Do you just read it like a prayer?

2) Regarding the Invitatory - This is only said once per day. So if I pray Morning Prayers and Daytime Prayers, I would only say this during Morning Prayers.

3) I understand the little red crosses are to cross yourself e.g ""Lord, + open my lips. - And my mouth will proclaim your praise."" and this means you make a cross over your lips - I am assuming that the ""-"" sign indicates the point at which you stop crossing yourself?

4) I have also noticed some little red ""\*""s as well - what do these mean?

5) I have also noticed red crosses that are longer than the ""+"" sign - what do these mean?

6) The guy in the video I watched seemed to suggest that there are some things that you do not need to say if praying alone - like some of the parts that are meant to be responsal. Am I correct in assuming it's ok to just read through and pray the whole thing?

7) Are there any streams of people praying the Liturgy of the Hours live? I think that might be helpful to feeling comfortable with this.

The theology behind why only men can be priests seems to also apply to the idea that only Jew can be priests.

But the 12 apostles were also all Jewish. St. Paul, the Apostle to the Gentiles, was a Jew. As far I’m aware there’s no scriptural record of any apostle of Jesus being a Jew. 

It’s also often discussed how the Priest acts *in persona Christi* as a reason that he must be male. But being Jewish is also an intrinsic trait of the character of Jesus.

I was far from the Roman Church, and I did not understand a lot of important material. Religion started to seem silly to me, and I started becoming convinced in my own ignorance. 

Thanks to God, I saw the truth and became a Christian again, but I was still unfamiliar enough with Roman Catholicism to make the jump. Reddit played an important role in having my questions answered, and I am happy to report that I am a Catholic now. 

I am not simply a Catholic who believes. I also do actively try to push arguments in favor of God and Catholic philosophy. 

Unfortunately, Reddit ~~never~~ does not always prize reasoned arguments. That is why I think it is important for us to have a neutral space for debating philosophy, that is not focused on blocking anyone who disagrees. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is why I currently head the subreddit known as r/DebatePhilosophers. I make daily posts there about the foundations of our faith and try to engage people. 

If you are able to, I would greatly appreciate you joining the subreddit and becoming active, so we can cultivate a place we love and share.

Finding words to express one's struggle with mental illness...,catena_argentea,1620616068,"...often does not come easy, especially for people of faith (ironically). As a Catholic who's been dealing with the burden of depression and bipolar disorder for many years, I've certainly spent a lot of time looking inwards, and finding little more than darkness that fills my mind with lies, and attempts to rob me of hope and light and the true knowledge that I'm a loved child of God. Sometimes it's hard to stop my ears and not listen to it, but tonight I was moved to try something different - I've written poetry before, but I've never written it with the intent of addressing my 'dark accuser' directly with the words of refusal and rejection, seeing the mental illness for what it is - a distortion of reality and self-perception, that clouds the mind with half-truths and despair. Sounds kind of like a certain someone, if you catch my drift.  
  
In any case, while I drew on the religious imagery, I didn't intentionally write it as a psalm, or a lorica, but simply tried to give words to what I was feeling during my current episode, while making a conscious refusal not to give in to my depression. And maybe attempt a small degree of poetic imagery that resonated with me. Anyway, if this isn't the right place for it, mods, do your thing :) But I hope this will help others find words in some small measure.  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;*‘Quo Vadis?’*  
  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;I am still here  
I stumble as the darkness washes over me  
Poured out over my head  
Like a black baptism  
But the water of life wells up in my heart to meet it  
Waves crashing    
Thunder and peal of noise against melody  
Dark water set against crystal dew  
Ringing in my ears  
Curse against blessing  
Fear against hope  
Your lies like seaweed around my drowned bones  
&amp;nbsp;  
 
&gt;*‘I’m still here’*  
&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;The dark water becomes ink  
Becomes black wine  
Drugging me with its bitter gall  
Writing its words above my head  
‘He was a king of peace’  
Now the king of a mound of bones  
Fallow, once-hallowed ground  
Where the tree of my life once blossomed  
I float and sink, borne and born  
Harrowed by the hell of bitter water  
That pours out of my skin  
Like a burning river  
&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;*‘I refuse your water, liar’*  
  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;I thirst and gasp  
Choked by the dust of broken vessels      
Whence I poured out my hope    
Of waters pure and clear   
Free of your bitter herbs    
Standing at a door of my passover    
Slaking my thirst in the light that pours    
In through a crack that you made    
Betraying your violence  
That you visit upon the temple of my mind  
You set an abomination in the holiest of holies  
And I tear it down with bloodied fingers  
    
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;*‘I wash myself clean, accuser’*
&gt;  
  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;You would take me, chew me out  
Mark me with your sigil and spew me out  
Like the bones of what once was man  
Who fell short of his promise  
Betrayer to his people  
Good for nothing but fire  
Purged and ashen  
But I’m still here  
And you are now smoke and shadow  
A pale mist of a churning black pool  
Your poison fire-quenched  
Your clouds blown away  
  
  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;*‘I am not yours’*  
  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;
&gt;You steal my king’s ransom  
And pay me back in broken bones  
You lock me in your proud tower  
Raised like a vulgar herm  
Above the field of my shattered shields  
You point the way to nowhere  
And I refuse your call  
I am still my own  
I feel my strength blossom in me  
Petals untouched by your poisoned spittle  
You yell and lob your venom at me  
And I am guarded and unharmed  
  
&gt;  
&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;*‘I choose life’*

&gt;You’d light black candles  
At the altar you bloody with my life’s joy  
With every whispered lie  
You would profane my soul   
Tear my ancients and my children from me  
And from my birth pangs  
Bring forth abomination  
But I refuse you with a cracked voice  
Scream into your darkened face  
Until my breath is luminescent fire  
And you are consigned to the flames  
With the throng of your lies and thievery    
  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;*‘You are nothing’*  
  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;I am here  
You are less than nowhere  
You are the place of endless roads  
That circle fell Abaddon    
Peopled by the harpies you gather  
Like decaying corpses of slain fears  
You resurrect from their whitewashed tombs  
And bring forth upon me to tear me anew  
You are a smaller than a mote  
And I grow beyond measure  
Unbound and free of your tongs  
I refuse you again and again    
  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;*‘I am here, and I remain’*
  
&gt;  
&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;I reject you  
I will not intone your poisoned litany  
I will not count your jagged beads  
I will not pray at your altar of lies  
I am a child nourished by love  
Unbowed by your bitter whip  
That you lash around my bruised heart  
And pull my face down into the mire  
I am more than you  
And you are not my dark lord  
I will serve you no longer  
But turn to the one who gives me rest   
  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;*Where I am wont to go   
You would take me away   
But I’m still here   
I refuse your water, liar   
I wash myself clean, accuser   
I am not yours   
I choose life   
You are nothing   
I am here, and I remain   
Made for light and joy, and life everlasting    
Where night will be no more    
And your lies will forever be purged   
with words of hope made true*

Reminder to fast and do penance for the German Church tomorrow!,SupemeLeaderSmeagol,1620615630,"Blessings of Christ be with you my brethren, 

As many of you know, the situation with the mass blessing of homosexual unions by German clergy is happening tomorrow. This is something that could and likely is going to greviously wound the Body of Christ no matter what the consequences are. The faithful and unfaithful alike there desperately need our prayers, as does the Holy Father and his Curia. I would also humbly suggest joining in some sort of fast or other penance as an offering for what will transpire. 
 
As our Lord reminds us in Matthew 17:21 (“This kind of demon does not go out but by prayer and fasting”), fasting has a unique power as a form of as a way of doing battle with adversarial forces. 

No matter what transpires tomorrow, whether it leads to a schism, is ignored by the hierarchy, or is resolved quickly and without headache, we know that Christ always has the victory. He is good and he loves mankind.

Protestant thinking about converting to Catholicism,FacelessMan80,1620613866,"I'm 41/male/married/no kids and was raised in and still follow the Protestant church. I was told by my parents and some at church that Catholicism is wrong, probably similar to Catholics hearing/learning that Protestants are wrong, but lately I've felt drawn to the Catholic church and have been listening to EWTN radio + Google searching. I think what really draws me is Catholicism has been consistent for centuries while Protestant denominations all seem to believe something a little bit differently (Baptist vs Assembly of God vs Methodist vs Lutheran vs Presbyterian vs Non-denominational, etc). 

**I'm giving a lot of thought to converting to Catholicism but I have serious and genuine questions first**. If you're answering please don't give blanket answers like ""Protestants are wrong/false/fake."" Protestants say the same things about Catholics. 

Either way I have a lot of respect for all faiths and denominations 🙂 What I do believe is the Bible and we both read and believe that. 

—————————

&gt; Why do Catholics pray to Saints, Mary, and others and not just to Jesus? &gt;&gt; In John 14:6 Jesus said ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" So why would anybody pray to Mary or a Saint or anybody else on their behalf, and not pray directly to Jesus for their needs? If Catholics do pray to God themselves, what would be the additional and/or separate need for also praying to a different entity like a saint or Mary? 

&gt; What is purgatory and what evidence is there that proves it exists? &gt;&gt; I don't believe in purgatory but mostly because I've always been told by family and others that it doesn't exist. I think the link below has very good points but still not convincing for me. I believe the Bible to be true and while I agree the Bible does not mention purgatory specifically it does give subtle possibilities for it, but nothing that says it actually exists with 100% certainty like it does for heaven and hell, which I do believe in. Hebrews says judgment will come after death, Revelations says nothing unclean will ever enter it (heaven) nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, and 1 Peter 3:19 (also mentioned in the link) says Jesus went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits. But Luke 23:43 says when one of the criminals on a cross next to Jesus asked Jesus to remember him when he went into the kingdom, Jesus told the criminal ""...today you will be with me in paradise."" On the cross Jesus did not tell the criminal that he would go to purgatory first or go into holding, but he would be with Jesus in paradise. -- I understand that purgatory can be a sensitive subject and maybe not everybody agrees on it, but I would be willing to bet there are less Catholics in disagreement about purgatory than there are different Protestant denominations. I personally do not believe in purgatory because it is not entirely supported in scripture like heaven and hell are, but I am open to the idea &gt;&gt; Link: https://www.catholic.com/tract/purgatory

&gt; Why do Catholics have statues in churches and other items that they kneel before and pray to? &gt;&gt; Leviticus 26:1 says ""Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves, and do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it. I am the Lord your God."" Then in 1 Corinthians 10:14 Paul says ""...flee from idolatry."" Having statues and decorated windows seems to go against scripture. 

&gt; Why do you refer to priests as Father and to the Pope as His Holiness, Holy Father, etc? &gt;&gt; I do not agree with calling anybody holy or bowing down before any man (the Pope). The only being I believe is holy is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Exodus 20:3 says ""You shall have no other gods before me"" and in Luke 4:8 Jesus said ""...Worship the Lord your God and serve him only."" Then Romans 3:22-23 says ""...righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory God."" Romans 3:23 is my favorite verse in the entire Bible because it basically says we all fall short and we all need a saviour in Jesus, even the Pope. So I don't understand why anybody would refer to another human being as holy while they are still on earth? 

&gt; Why not just use the Bible for direction? &gt;&gt; I don't understand all the different doctrines and documents and instructions that I hear talked about on EWTN radio. Eucharist, The Catechism, Sacraments, Reconciliation, Hail Mary's, and other things like Papal documents &amp; instructions I've heard talked about. 

&gt; What is the purpose of confessing sins to a priest in a booth? &gt;&gt; Several new testament references tell us to confess our sins, thus it should be done. But I do not understand the purpose of confessing to a priest in a booth instead of confessing sins to one another. 

&gt; Where has the Catholic church been during repulsive times in Christianity? &gt;&gt; During Emperor Nero's rule during the Roman Empire many Christians were tortured and killed in the coliseum. During World War II millions of Jews were murdered by Nazi Germany. Now today around the world many Christians face ridicule and persecution in places where Christianity is a large minority. These are just a few examples, but where has the Catholic church been in these times? What has the Catholic church done to help people in times of great need? Maybe Christians under Nero's rule could have been saved but we don't know. In WW2 Jews could have been saved but no doubt it would have been extremely complicated. And today around the world people are starving (Africa, Eastern Europe, etc) and/or being forced from their homes (Africa, Iraq, China) and/or being beaten or flogged (Indonesia). Acts 20:35 says ""It is more blessed to give than to receive"" &gt;&gt; How has the Catholic church helped and how are they continuing to help?

&gt; The Vatican is very wealthy. Why don't they help more places that are in need? &gt;&gt; The Vatican was established as a country and it is very tiny, but it is also very wealthy. At times it seems like the church is sitting on its wealth and not doing much to help areas in need. Why doesn't The Vatican and the Catholic church do more to help areas in need? ",Catholicism

Homosexuality and the Primacy of Conscience,EgregiousNegus,1620613669,"Why would God create a gay/lesbian person, only to send him/her to Hell for engaging in gay/lesbian behavior? Is it not the natural desire of, say, a gay person to have sex with men? Offering no possible opportunity for said activity to take place (if one wishes to remain Catholic)--that is, in or outside of marriage--does God not condemn them to a life of perpetual sexual repression and mental anguish? Given that it has been unanimously proven that sexual orientation is determined before birth (i.e. to say that these folks don't have a say in whom they're attracted to), why are they punished for wanting to follow through on their desires?

I understand the argument that humans, as a symptom of The Fall, have biological desires on which we ought not follow through (such as, a man having a biological urge to impregnate many women), but, then, that leads us back to the original question of why God would create someone with no other outlet of ultimate sexual expression than to have homosexual tendencies/engage in said behavior... and then make that very outlet illicit, by law of the Catholic Church.

The health of the soul affecting the mind and body,CalculatorOctavius,1620604138,"I was just thinking about something. Whenever I receive the sacraments, especially Penance and Eucharist, I can physically and mentally feel an effect from them. I feel mentally more at ease, and in control. I feel physically more relaxed and comfortable, and more balanced and whole. 

Of course our souls are not physical, and grace is not physical. Grace is sort of like the medicine for the soul. 

As we know, when the mind is not healthy, the disorder manifests itself physically in the body. Anxiety often leads to poor posture, which leads to imbalance, and back pain down the road. Likewise, a lack in physical health affects the health of the mind as well. When you don’t exercise, or eat right, or hydrate yourself enough, you often get mental health ailments. 

With this connection between the body and mind, we also know through revelation that the soul is very much tied with the mind. Our will and our intellect, products of the soul, are affected by our experiences and memories, which are products of the brain and the mind. It’s also true that the soul has been described as the form of the body. 

It makes sense then, that the health or unhealth, or other activity of the spiritual, and of the soul, could cause physical sensations, or impact mental workings. The hesychasts of the East use certain prayers and bodily postures in order to invoke a physical experience of God. This is heavily tied to the concept of theosis, or divine action as we call it in the West - the experience of the achieving of the sharing of God’s divinity while here on earth, before our death. 

It seems logical that through grace, from faith and prayer and the sacraments, we could achieve a greater control of our passions, and have an easier time bringing ourselves to good health, mental and physical. This is in contrast with the more “prosperity gospel” idea that if you have enough faith you will be rewarded with good health and wealth. It seems to me more that with grace, and through a healthier soul, you can attain a better grasp of your reality. 

Anyways I just thought I’d share that and see if anyone has any other thoughts on the topic. Is this reasonable and in line with Church teaching?",Catholicism

Exorcism and church failures in society.,DependentShirt8089,1620601555,"Hello all,

Just got done watching most of a Matt Fradd and Father Vincent Lampert podcast. Link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x6YTz-B24FA

The stuff this guy talks about is crazy.  It got me thinking we have an incredible problem with belief in God and in the church within society.  I feel our church leadership is weak and has yielded to the evil one.  We shut down mass, we limited the amount of people that can worship and all the while culture morality is trending down at a fast rate.  Don’t believe me check out the views on this video 109,000 compared to other stuff easily deemed garbage.  

To me if everything this priest says is true than the verdict is out and the search is over.  We (society) can stop looking for God with crystals and other new age bullshit.  I mean it’s understandable if someone is skeptical of Catholicism or Christianity, but the moment a person starts levitating and cursing people because they believe in Christ we can say “wow this Jesus guy must be pretty special”.

I propose the church document demonic possession and exorcisms on a high level, not to glorify the evil, but rather show the power of Christ. Video this stuff so we can show people the power of Christ and the danger of straying from him.  There is no argument for not doing this.  None of my friends believe in God, you start showing them the stuff this priest is talking about they will sprint to the nearest parish and get involved in RCIA.  It seems the church is keeping a wrap on this stuff for no reason.  It could be a great evangelical tool.  If the Vatican was reporting this stuff and making it public to major news networks than people would start talking about it. Heck government may even investigate it and consecrate themselves to  Christ.  Any pushback from making this public is either directly from Satan or the inability of old people in leadership to take advantage of technology (social media, video, the power of interconnected society).",Catholicism

The St. Thérèse Novena - prayer warriors needed!,Pretty_Fee24,1620599565,"Hi fellow Catholics, I wanted to get on here and kind of explain my devotion to St. Thérèse, as well as a story regarding the novena.

So, back in early 2020 Before the pandemic was even a topic at that point, I had gone to evening mass at our local parish, and I was deeply depressed at that point in my life. I did something I would normally never dream of doing that night: after mass, I confronted the priest celebrating and said, ""Father, I'm very lonely right now. I can't find a man like me, I wish I could find my future husband."" The priest was very serious, but calm and advised me to pray the novena to Sts Louis and Zelie Martin, the parents of St. Thérèse. Now at that point, I wasn't a very ""prayer-y"" kind of Catholic, and was rather cynical, but I took his advice and prayed it anyway. 

Now, it was early February when I prayed this novena, and I want to say maybe sometime after the novena was complete, I got an invitation to a friend's birthday party on Facebook. I hadn't seen this friend in a while, and I missed her, so I accepted the invite. I started having dreams about meeting my husband at the party, but I ignored those dreams thinking it was all just in my head. 

So, I went to the party, and after completing the novena I was not expecting my prayers to be answered any time soon. I wanted to just keep my interactions with men casual, nothing serious, just one night meet-and-greet kind of deals. So I went into this party with the mindset that maybe I'd meet a cute guy and make out or something for one night, but that's it. I didn't expect anything more. 

At this party, I chatted with my friend's friends, got to know some people and made conversation. About an hour after I arrive, three guys come in the door. The one in the grey jacket immediately caught my eye, there was just something different about him that I really liked. So, I asked my friend who he was, and she said it's her neighbor, and that he was single. I told her that I thought he was really cute, but I didn't know how to talk to him. She introduced us, the man and I shook hands, and suddenly we just hit it off with talking, we had a lot in common. 

Later that evening, the party ended up at his place next door, as we were talking about films we enjoyed and he put on a movie for us. I immediately got in close to him, and he put his arm around me. Again, I was still thinking that this was going to be a one-night interaction, that we'd say goodbye at the end of the night and we'd never talk again. Eventually the party attendees cleared out and it was just the two of us, and with my sensitive stomach issues, I couldn't handle any more alcohol, despite having only one serving's worth. I sat on the edge of his bed, holding my stomach. He rubbed my back and something about that was so sweet and calming to me, and made me feel so much better. I looked back at him as he was rubbing my back and I heard a voice say, ""this is going to be your husband one day."" I dismissed the voice as nonsense, I don't even know this man! I thought he wouldn't want anything to do with me after this night! 

It turns out I was very wrong. We ended up dating for 5 months and the relationship was happy and healthy. We eventually split up because of his moving and job situation, given that we lived a bit far apart during this pandemic to boot. So, after we broke up, I felt the need to ask St. Thérèse if this was in fact my husband. I prayed her novena, asking for yellow roses if it was him, and white roses if it was not.

On the last day, I was scrolling through my Facebook feed and passed this post of a married couple. I suddenly scrolled back up, my mom had shared a story about an elderly married couple who had tried on their wedding attire after 60 years, and shared their secret to everlasting love through their faith. Lo and behold, this lovely bride was holding a bouquet of 3 yellow roses! I couldn't believe it! I started seeing yellow roses everywhere after I had witnessed that...and it was usually in 3's. Why 3 you may ask? Well this gentleman is not Catholic, and I remember this phrase I once heard: ""Marriage takes 3: God, you and me."" Perhaps this means he will convert! 

So, friends, I need your help. I have been storming heaven with prayers for reuniting me and this gentleman, and for his conversion as well. We have not gotten back together yet, and it's been almost a year. I have a feeling it may come soon, though, and I would appreciate any prayers I can get! St. Thérèse, pray for us!",Catholicism
The small things that got lost in the switch from the Tridentine Mass to the new Mass - why?,KiwiNFLFan,1620599273,"I have attended both the Tridentine Mass and the new Mass of Paul VI. I have attended a variety of churches in New Zealand, and have noticed certain features of the Tridentine Mass that for some reason got lost in the transition to the new Mass (as per my own experience). 

* Use of the chalice veil
* Ringing the bell when the priest and servers leave the sacristy
* The priest wearing a biretta at the start/end of Mass
* Beginning and ending the sermon with ""In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen""
* Use of the term ""Holy Ghost"" (""Holy Spirit"" seems to be used across the board now)
* Ringing of altar bells at the consecration (have seen it but not a lot)
* The recitation of the Leonine Prayers after weekday Mass
* The reduction or even total elimination of altar servers (I have probably seen just as many Sunday Masses without any altar servers as with them)

Also, why does a typical new Mass have much less ritual and ceremony than a standard Tridentine Mass? There is an Anglican church in my city (High Anglican/Anglo-Catholic) that has a more ""ceremonial"" Eucharist than any of the Catholic parishes I've visited. Incense is used every Sunday, and altar servers lead a procession to the altar with thurifer and crucifer. Another High Anglican parish here has six candles and a cross in the middle of them on a shelf behind the altar, as did an Anglican church in the capital where I used to live. It's almost like many Catholic churches have ""discarded"" these things and the Anglicans have picked them up, dusted them off and put them to good use. Why?",Catholicism

I have been fully vaccinated and while we don’t have to argue on here about vaccines (if you do then ur just a troll lol), I do think it is a good idea to go ahead and band together to fulfill our obligations from our bishops. 

My Archbishop made a pretty good observation that many of our catholic social programs (at least here in the south) have not been active in protesting the use of fetal cell lines in medicine. Our archdiocese is beginning a campaign to send letters, make phone calls, and protest against the use of these fetal cell lines.

I am scared that once I receive my sacraments I will be letting God down because I will not be able to attend mass. I really do love God a lot and am so excited to become Catholic.

Thought we were following God's will but now life is much more difficult,lostcacti,1620574307,"A while ago I had the chance to apply to a once in a lifetime job. At the time I was working on a job I didn't like and was miserable in but my spouse was in a job they enjoyed. There job was a long shot but it was exactly what I'd spent 12 yrs in school for and was exactly what I felt called to do. I discussed with my spouse before applying and they encouraged me.

During the interview process, we prayed that God would lead us where he wanted us and that whatever happened with this job that the result would be good for our marriage and our faith. We concluded that one indication would be whether or not I got the job, especially because it was a long shot. 

Well I got the job. There offer came right after I started looking for new work because the job I was in at that time was so stressful that it was wearing away at our marriage and causing my spouse harm. So it truly did seem like God's will. We prayed and talked more and it was a tough decision because it was a pay cut and a move away from my spouse's family. But we concluded that we should take it because it was what I felt called to. 

Well, it's been much worse than we expected. I'm happy in the work and it's what I expected. I do feel more peace but that's the only positive. My spouse is now working in a job that is so stressful that they have developed severe GI problems and we are struggling to get medical help even as their health gets worse. They really do want to be in a job as it's important to them to work and contribute but there are no opportunities for them in their field and the career path they desire.  We've also learned that one of my  in-laws is experiencing a severe mental health crisis. We're too far away to help and they don't really have others who can help them. It's terrifying to not be able to help. 

On top of this, or faith has grown weaker. We had an excellent parish and the new place is vastly different, less dynamic and not welcoming to new people. We don't have have friends and feel alone. For awhile, our marriage was strengthened by the move but lately we've just been focusing on trying to survive. Praying is really difficult.

So I'm not sure how it could have gone so opposite what we prayed for, except that I discerned wrong.

Absence of good,Comfortable-Flow-632,1620568893,"Could someone please explain what is meant by evil being the absence of good? Like, I understand that it means that bad things, such as suffering, merely the absence of fundamentally good things like happiness. I agree with this, but don't evil things still feel real? I mean, pain might be the absence of health, but it still hurts. Here, we might say that we only feel pain because something is wrong with our health. I guess we could take the darkness being the absence of light example too. Darkness is obviously not something tangible, but we can still feel it. I would love to know your opinions as well as what are the actual implications of evil being the absence of good? The way I see it, evil being the absence of good doesn't mean that it isn't real, but merely that any action that seeks to eliminate evil must also increase good, otherwise it isn't really good. This almost seems like a rebuttal to philosophies like negative utilitarianism, which are solely concerned with reducing suffering and can lead to absurd conclusions such as ending all life. Thanks 

Edit: also, would appreciate your views on this response by Bertrand Russell. (Taken from Wikipedia)

""...] the belief that, as a matter of fact, nothing that exists is evil, is one which no one would advocate except a metaphysician defending a theory. Pain and hatred and envy and cruelty are surely things that exist, and are not merely the absence of their opposites; but the theory should hold that they are indistinguishable from the blank unconsciousness of an oyster. Indeed, it would seem that this whole theory has been advanced solely because of the unconscious bias in favour of optimism, and that its opposite is logically just as tenable. We might urge that evil consists in existence, and good in non-existence; that therefore the sum-total of existence is the worst thing there is, and that only non-existence is good. Indeed, Buddhism does seem to maintain some such view. It is plain that this view is false; but logically it is no more absurd than its opposite.[6]""",Catholicism

Our Lady Undoer of Knots Has Been Blessing Me,pursuingholiness,1620559905,"I just wanted to post this here, since I realized it.

I prayed a novena to Our Lady Undoer of Knots around her feast day for multiple intentions, and they seem to be resolved now.

I had a lot of anxiety and family issues, but since about 2 days ago, it's like they all resolved themselves.

I also prayed to Our Lady Undoer of Knots, last week, when I had to do my hair. I'm embarrassingly lazy about doing it, so most of the time, I just wash it, let it dry, and wrap it up again. Since I wear headscarves 24/7, I usually don't have the motivation to make my hair look nice anyway. It gets matted at the roots really easily, and is usually painful to detangle (I have afro textured hair). After a few weeks (sometimes months :/ of washing and not combing, it starts to dread).

I finally got around to combing out my hair last week, and prayed for Mama Mary Undoer of Knots to help me detangle the knots from my hair, just as all loving mothers do for their own children's hair. I was so sure my hair would have dreaded and matted really badly, and it would be painful to pull all the strands apart, but nope. My hair was hardly tangled at all, and got through with combing it pretty fast. I also didn't feel any soreness on my scalp where I usually do. 

So Mary is good for untangling all kinds of knots in our lives. I recommend devotion to her if you are going through anything that seems impossible to do undo :)",Catholicism

Today I thought very hard about Holy Communion and if I should avoid it until confession. I have to be careful of scrupulous behaviour so I really wasn't sure. I decided to abstain and remain in my seat at the back unless something happened out of the ordinary to get me to receive.


In my mind I decided I wasn't shifting unless the steward asked me 3 times to step forward from the bench. When it came to it just before they started calling rows up I realised at the end of my bench, I sat in the middle alone, at the end an old lady with a walking frame had settled. The steward called the priest up right from the front to administer to her so she wouldn't have to move.


I bowed as the priest arrived and I waited bit soon realised he called me by name and held host out to me! It was a situation where he probably thought it would disturb the lady me later getting up to get past her. Crazy, I have *never* had the Holy Eucharist brought to me and presented in a church in 35 years or so until today - right when I was doubting Him. It brought me to tears.

**Accountability framework I have in mind**: discussing goals weekly via discord/zoom/phone + frequent (daily?) checkins to keep one another accountable

**My values**: Was agnostic until very recently; now view my work as a part of a bigger picture (ie serving my community/leave this place in a better condition than I found it in). Would be neat to discuss spiritual matters as well

**Ideal bud(s):** Solid men who want to improve in all areas of life and are not afraid to tell it like it is. Men committed to building excellence of character. Genuine mutual accountability with genuine interest in helping one another achieve their goals/life's work.

Why are there so many Catholic Freemasons?,Soldier_ofthe_Cross,1620522384,"Okay, here’s some backstory:

I was once caught outside of a lodge while I was trying to identify some of the symbols on the building’s exterior. A Mason came out, saw me, asked me what I was doing, and I replied, “I can’t identify this symbol, can you help me?”

I am trying to play it cool and he looks at me suspiciously and asks if I am a Mason. I tell him that I am not, but that I am interested in the organization (which isn’t a lie since I study Masonry and it’s relationship to the Catholic Church). He asks me if I’ve ever been inside of a lodge, I shake my head, and he asks me if I’d like to come in.

Now I am working an undercover mission! I was terrified beyond belief, but this was my chance to learn about Freemasonry first-hand.

Long story short: He goes on and on about the history of the lodge and Freemasonry in general while making the usual claims about how Freemasonry is misunderstood. He says that many religions are foolishly opposed to Freemasonry, but that many Catholics and Evangelicals are still Freemasons despite what their Church or pastor tells them about the organization.

And the sad part about it is that he’s right. There are MANY Catholic Freemasons. This has been the case for centuries. For example, Simón Bolívar was a Catholic and a Freemason, Juan Guaidó, the disputed President of Venezuela is openly a Freemason, and many other Catholics, whether in the U.S., Latin America, the Philippines, or elsewhere have joined Masonic organizations.

Why do Catholics continue to join lodges if the Church explicitly forbids it?",Catholicism

I came across this passage while reading my Bible, and it's left me doubting my faith. Why would God give this law? The woman being forced to marry her rapist and never being able to divorce him seems counter-productive, as it just gives the rapist more opportunities to rape her. Why not just sentence the rapist to death, like in other cases of rape? If it helps the translation of the Bible I use is the Good News Bible.",Catholicism

I saw a cartoon and it go me thinking.,curious_travelator,1620520585,"I'm in the UK and there is a TV series featuring a Catholic senior policeman. In times of stress the character will utter various Catholic ejaculations. ""Jesus, Mary and Joseph"" or another one that ""Holy Mother of God"" - a cartoonist took an image of the  policeman being shown by a junior colleague a picture of Mary and the infant Jesus.

The junior policeman says ""It's a 100% confirmed dna match"" and the senior policeman says ""Holy Mother of God"" and this made me wonder.

The Nicene creed tells us

*by the power of the Holy Spirit*

*he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,*

*and was made man.*

So then I was thinking from a genetic perspective Jesus' dna would have derived from his mother and by the power of holy spirit

here's roughly what the science says

*People usually have two copies of each chromosome. One copy is inherited from their mother (via the egg) and the other from their father (via the sperm). A sperm and an egg each contain one set of 23 chromosomes. When the sperm fertilises the egg, two copies of each chromosome are present (and therefore two copies of each gene), and so an embryo forms.*

So my question is ""Where does the Paternal DNA come from?"" and what does that mean - we believe Jesus was fully God and also fully man. So we can't say that the ""Paternal DNA"" was some ""divine/miraculous"" intervention or can we?

I'd be interested to know what various theologians have come to conclude on thinking about the question of Jesus' genetic inheritance.",Catholicism

Had First Confession Today,Shanea10,1620513905,"Just went to my First Confession, and the experience was even better than I expected it to be. I was a little nervous going into it, but extremely relieved once I left. The whole experience felt like a weight was taken off of my shoulders. I was contemplating not going behind the screen, but ended up choosing to go behind the screen for my first time. I might not go behind the screen my next time, but not sure yet. During the Confession, the Rev Deacon gave me some really great advice, feedback, and next steps for me moving forward. I was able to feel God's presence during the experience and the experience as a whole was very strong and emotional.

I used this short but informative [guide](https://straymonds.org/wp-content/uploads/Examination-of-Conscience-FINAL-small-revision-2019.pdf) to help me with my Examination of Conscience, my Act of Contrition, and the overall process as a whole. It's in a Brochure Format, so I personally just printed it out on a single page and folded it into a Brochure. I then went through the 10 Commandments in the guide, and the guide as a whole, as I was writing my list that I brought into Confession. Two other helpful resources I used were this [short guide](https://www.usccb.org/resources/Bulletin-Insert-Penance-ENG.pdf) which emphasized praying before confession and u/Trubea 's comment on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/dkl52f/first_confession_tips/) (thank you u/Trubea !!).

My list was on a 5x8"" piece of note paper. I chose to go with paper rather than a cellphone because I personally think a paper feels more raw (not sure if this makes sense). The list started off with everything to do before I start listing off my sins; so it started with ""Bless me Father for I have sinned"" and went on from there. After a few times though I will hopefully remember this in its entirety and no longer need to include it. It then included the list of my sins that I confessed, which also included the amount of times I committed each sin. And then I wrapped up the list I brought in with my Act of Contrition, which I may also remember this after a few times and no longer need to include it. After Confession was over, I made sure to rip up the piece of note paper I had and throw it away.

For those who are planning on going to their First Confession, I would not hesitate! I recommend praying before your Examination of Conscience and trusting God throughout the whole presence. Your Priest, Rev Deacon, etc. will be very understanding that it is your first time and will work with you. It is also okay to stumble on your words, be emotional, ask questions, etc. during the process!

PanENtheism and Divine Simplicity,N0RedDays,1620510333,"Hi all,

Quick questions regarding to somewhat confusing topics I have come across lately. Any help would be appreciated. I am looking to know what the Catholic Church says on these topics even though I am not Catholic.

First: Is PanENtheism (NOT PANTHEISM) anathema? I read a Catholic encyclopedia entry that had a lot of Panentheistic language, but I have heard this is anathema. Basically, my question is: Since God is Omnipresent (present everywhere at once) is He also present IN everything to some extent (interpenetration)? Note, I am NOT saying God IS the world/everything. God is obviously transcendent to Creation. But for God to be truly omnipresent, wouldn't his essence also interpenetrate Creation without being creation? I am confused and don't know what to think.

Second: Divine Simplicity. Is it safe to say that God is the attributes he ""possesses""? I.e: God is Love, God is Justice, God is Power, God is Omnipresence, God is Omnipotence, God is Omniscience.
Is this correct?
Furthermore, would it be safe to say God that God's love is his justice, God's omnipresence is his omniscience, etc? Since God is indivisible and infinite. This is also something that has really confused me.

Today I've found a store where there was ebook edition of Liturgia Horarum (here's the link: [http://www.breviariodigitale.com/ebooks.cfm?categoria=tutte&amp;lingua=tutte&amp;rito=tutte&amp;parola=](http://www.breviariodigitale.com/ebooks.cfm?categoria=tutte&amp;lingua=tutte&amp;rito=tutte&amp;parola=)) but unfortunately the store was shut down 5 months ago :(.  Is there anybody here who has bought these ebook edition in pdf format or has other edition of Liturgia Horarum in pdf or epub file(s)?",Catholicism

I have a question regarding St.Catherine's vision of hell,uiolabv,1620496777,"&gt; ""Now because they did not amend themselves after the first reproof that they had of injustice and false judgment, neither in the second, which was that, in death, they would not hope in Me, nor grieve for the offense done to Me, but only for their own pain, have they thus so miserably received Eternal Punishment.""

So does this mean God only forgives sinners who repent for offending Him? And not the sinners who repent out of fear of hell?

Also,

&gt; ""The fourth torment that they have is the fire. This fire burns and does not consume, for the being of the soul cannot be consumed, because it is not a material thing that fire can consume. But I, by Divine justice, have permitted the fire to burn them with torments, so that it torments them, without consuming them, with the greatest pains in diverse ways according to the diversity of their sins, to some more, and to some less, according to the gravity of their fault.

Not as open-minded as I used to be,nomadicchic,1620492609,"I was raised Catholic I've been baptized and received my First Holy Communion as a child.  I fell away from my faith for a little over a decade.  I identified as atheist for the most part and started studying Hinduism and New Age practices in my early 20s.  This year Jesus has given me a huge reality check and I've realized the error of my ways.  I want to go back to growing spiritually as a Catholic.  I recently went to confession and received the Eucharist after about 15 years.  I plan to complete my confirmation as soon as possible.  

With that being said,  I feel that my ways of thinking are changing dramatically.  I used to believe that people should be able to do whatever they want as long as they're not hurting others.  With the help of God, I've quit smoking weed two months ago.  I never thought it was possible and it was hard at first, but I no longer have desires to smoke.  I noticed that all my friendships with stoners, which were most of them, have completely ended.  It's interesting because the very few friends that I have left are Catholic.  I don't believe in coincidences, so I think God is trying to tell/show me something.

I recently moved to a new city with an extremely large LGBTQ+ community.  I don't think anything bad about these people as I've been friends with many gay people and they've always been kind to me.  Their sexual preferences never bothered me, but lately I can't help but see it as wrong.  I think it's wrong for me to judge others yet I can't help but see these same-sex couples as unnatural.  It's strange because the old me could care less.

I also used to think women should be able to choose if they want to have an abortion even though that's something I would never even once consider for myself.  Then I realized why would I support that decision if it's something I wouldn't do?  Now that I am pro-life, I am very disgusted by my old beliefs and the fact that abortion/birth-control is becoming so normalized nowadays.

However, recently I started to feel like I’m comparing my life too much with other people - especially to the rich, privileged, people who are able to pursue their hobbies and education. I feel sad, envy, bitter and feel unfair whenever I read about how rich people spend their money. Suddenly I realised that I wasn’t like this before, why do I recently have these emotions.

About the use of “symbolism” and figurative language in book revelations,rpl_-_-_,1620489576,"Currently I am reading a book called Revelations: Catholic commentary on sacred scripture, and this is the summary of a small section

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading revelations is challenging because of the extensive use of symbols and figurative language. You may wonder “*why doesn’t the author speak directly”*

The confusion comes because “**Nowadays people are more “literal” in their “thinking” compared to those days”.** John draws his figures of speech from a wide range of **human experience.** His majority of signs and symbols come from ordinary life and social culture **know to** **his readers**

* · Simile: **Compares** 2 **unlike things** by using “like” or “as”
* · Metaphor: **Attributes** “qualities” of one thing to another **without “**like” or “as”
   * Poor, Blind, Naked
* Sky, sun, moon, stars and land= transcendent realities, whether good or evil
   * The face of risen Christ shines like the **sun** at its brightest
   * Whereas **Sea** means chaos and evil

·Animals in the revelations act as human beings (either good or evil). **Lamb, lion, dragon, horse, eagle** represents **superhuman** entities.

· Earthquakes, sun ceasing to shine, **moon turning into blood** indicates **interventions of god**

· Items of clothing represents the status 

· Harvesting, Sheparding, winemaking are given metaphorical meanings

* Colour represents quality of a person or thing (but the same colour might vary according to context)
   *  White horse means military victory
   *  Bride wearing white means purity
* Numbers are used **qualitatively** rather than quantitatively 
   * 7 and 10 means completeness ( 7 days in a week, 10 fingers of hand)
   * 3 ½ means incomplete 
   * 12 means number of people of god (from 12 tribes of Israel and 12 apostles of Jesus)
   * 24 (12 + 12) represents God’s people of both covenants
   * 1000 indicates large number rather than literal 1000

&amp;#x200B;

* The frequency of certain words is worth noting
   * Lord almighty is used **7** times
   * Christ is used **7** times
   * Jesus is used **14** times
   * Lamb is used **28** times
   * But for words like satan, multiples of 7 is avoided (8 times), dragon 13 times, beast 38 times

· Symbols

o The lamb is standing= Resurrection

o Though it had been slain= Crucifixion

o 7 horns= fullness of power (7 means complete, like 7 days of week)

o 7 eyes= fullness of knowledge

· Events are also symbolized

o Feast of vultures (19:17-18) likely indicating that Christ’s victory at the end of history will fulfil Ezekiel’s prophecy of destruction of those who oppose god (Ezek 39:17–20) , not just a literal battlefield",Catholicism

Saturday Prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary by St. Alphonsus Liguori + Practice of Devotion to Her,Child-of-Sky-Vault,1620486691,"**To obtain the Patronage of Mary:**

O Most Holy Mother! I am sensible of the graces which thou hast obtained for me, and of the ingratitude with which I have employed them; but notwithstanding this, I will not cease to confide in thy mercy, which is much greater than my ingratitude. O my powerful advocate, have pity on me. Thou art the dispenser of all the graces which God grants to us miserable sinners. For this end has he made thee so powerful. so rich, and so benign, that thou mayest succor us in our miseries. O Mother of mercy, leave me not in my poverty. Thou art the advocate of the most miserable and abandoned sinners when they have recourse to thee; defend me, therefore, who recommend myself to thee. Say not that my cause is difficult to be gained; whilst the most desperate causes, when entrusted to thee, are always successful. In thy hands, therefore, do I place my eternal salvation, and to thee do I consign my soul, which was lost, but which thou wilt save by thy holy intercession. This is my hope. Amen.

**The Practice of Devotion towards the Great Mother of God:**

As regards this devotion, I hope that the reader is fully persuaded that, in order to insure eternal salvation, it is most important to be devout to the Most Holy Mary. And if he should wish to be still more convinced of it, I would beg him to read the book I have written, called [***The Glories of Mary***](https://ecatholic2000.com/liguori/glories.shtml). We shall here speak only of the practices you may observe, that you may obtain the protection of this sovereign Lady. 

**First**, every morning and evening, when you rise and before you go to bed, say three *Hail Marys*, adding this short prayer: “*By thy pure and immaculate conception, O Mary, make me pure in body and holy in soul!*” And put yourself beneath her mantle, that she may keep you that day or that night from sin. And every time you hear the clock strike, say a *Hail Mary;* do the same whenever you go in or out of the house, and when you pass by any picture or statue of the Blessed Virgin. So also when you begin and finish any of your occupations, such as your study, work, eating, or sleeping, never omit to say a *Hail Mary*.   
**Secondly**, say the Rosary, meditating on the mysteries, every day, at least five decades. Many devout people also say the [***Office of Our Lady***](https://divinumofficium.com/cgi-bin/horas/officium.pl) \[click Parvum B.M.V. for it\]; it would be well to say at least the Little Office of the Name of Mary, which is very short, and composed of five short psalms.   
**Thirdly**, say an *Our Father* and *Hail Mary* every day to the ever-blessed Trinity in thanksgiving for the graces that have been bestowed upon Mary. The Blessed Virgin herself revealed to a person that this devotion was very pleasing to her.   
**Fourthly**, fast on bread and water every Saturday in honor of Mary, or at least on the vigils of her seven feasts; or at least fast in the ordinary way, or eat only of one dish, or abstain from something you like. In short, make use of some kind of mortification on Saturdays, and on the above-named vigils, for the sake of this Queen, who, as St. Andrew of Crete says, repays these little things with great graces.   
**Fifthly**, pay a visit every day to some image of your patroness, and ask her to give you holy perseverance and the love of Jesus Christ.   
**Sixthly**, let no day pass without reading a little about Our Lady, or else say some prayer to this Blessed Virgin. For this purpose we have here put seven prayers to Mary, for the seven days of the week (see Chap. II. §7).   
**Seventhly**, make the novenas for the seven principal feasts of Mary, and ask your confessor to tell you what devotions and mortifications you should practice during those nine days: say at least nine *Hail Marys* and *Glory be to the Father,* and beg her each day of the novena to give you some special grace that you need.   
**Lastly**, often recommend yourself to this divine Mother during the day, and particularly in time of temptation, saying at such times, and often repeating with great affection, “Mary, help me! help me, my Mother!” And if You love Mary, try to promote devotion to this great Mother of God among your relatives friends, and servants.

(Both the prayer and his tips on how to be devoted to her come from his ""A Christian's Rule of Life"" which is directed towards the laity so that they might learn holiness. Highly recommended. Here is [part one](https://alphonsianum.blogspot.com/2010/01/christians-rule-of-life-chapter-1.html), [part two](https://alphonsianum.blogspot.com/2010/01/christians-rule-of-life-chapter-2.html), [part three](https://alphonsianum.blogspot.com/2010/01/christians-rule-of-life-chapter-3.html), and [part four](https://alphonsianum.blogspot.com/2010/02/christians-rule-of-life-chapter-4.html) of that work.)

Confused by other Christians “hate” toward Catholicism,Slutevs,1620481302,"Tl;dr - what is the deal with Christians saying Catholicism is a false religion, etc etc

Hi everyone! I just have some questions and whatnot about the intense divide between Catholics and what seems like every other Christian. Sorry if this is a little long.. 

I’ve been Catholic my whole life. I had strayed from the church a bit but have been drawn back to renew my faith within the last few years and go deeper into learning about Jesus, scripture, and my faith as a whole. I found myself very confused about a lot of things so I thought the Bible was an awesome place to turn, since I hadn’t really studied it before. (Insert Catholic joke)

I reached out to a friend who I was aware wasn’t Catholic but a very dedicated Christian (I honestly don’t even know what kind). I asked if we could start a Bible study to learn more about scripture since I wasn’t really getting it on my own. He was so selfless and honored to share the Word with me. A very educated man, strong in his faith.. what kind of happened was the study morphed a bit into him trying to convert me to join a Bible church or essentially find a community that wasn’t Catholic. 

I had an open heart, willing to go where God led me. After some reflection and quite a few attempts on his end, I decided to let him know that I wasn’t interested in leaving my church. He went on to explain how Catholics preach a false gospel, how it’s a false religion, and very dangerous. I was honestly taken aback at how different he thought we were. Other than the deuterocanonical books, isn’t our Bible identical? Hadn’t we studied for weeks without issue? 

I tried to explain that I think a lot of this divide is simple a misunderstanding on non Catholics part. Simply, “hate” that has been taught to other Christians that the Catholic Church is in some way wrong. I’ve done a lot of research about both viewpoints, but I’m still finding myself having a lot of anxiety around this. I want to follow Jesus. I want to be saved and make sure I’m not being deceived. With that being said, I can’t find a problem with Catholicism that these Christians keep bringing up. Our mass is centered around Jesus. Isn’t there more than JUST scripture that can lead us to Christ? Why would a church that worships Jesus be so disliked among other Christians?

Bible verses/Prayers to read during tough times,Brilliant-Wafer-188,1620474008,"Hi, I'm currently going through a really rough time, and I'd really like something to reassure me that God loves me and that everything is gonna turn out ok in His time. 

(The story below is for a bit of context, so feel free to skip over it)

I'm a fresh graduate from university, but was suddenly thrust into a big role for a small company. Things were going fine and I was constantly getting praised for my efforts by my superior, but one day she just got mad and started telling me how incompetent I was. This was after we got into a big argument where she gave me the silent treatment.

 It turns out that she had been taking note of everything that I lacked, although she hadn't said a word about any of it.

I know in my mind that she was mostly at fault (a lot of co-workers are also scared of her and suffering from anxiety), but my low self-esteem has been gnawing at me for a while now. She's constantly being passive aggressive or hostile whenever I'm asking questions in our online workspace, and she just told me earlier that if she wanted to fire me if only she could. As a human doormat, I just let her walk all over me because I really don't like getting into fights. I always profusely apologize and tell her I'll do better, but she wasn't having any of it. She implied that she can say whatever she wanted because our company invested in psychologists (who we can schedule appointments with), and that she's not responsible for any anxiety attacks I've been having. She's well regarded in our field, so I can't defend myself even when she's slandering me on social media.

It's really hard to endure, but I'm also in a position where I can't quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been praying the rosary daily, and also asking St Jude and St. Joseph for their intercession because I feel very desperate. I know that I should have full confidence and faith that God only wants the best for me, but it's really hard to keep it in mind whenever my character and worth is constantly being attacked...

**So I'd really like to hear the Bible verses or prayers which helped you get through tough times, and I'd also like to hear how God answered your pleas (if it's ok for me to ask)!**",Catholicism

Is my understanding of hell correct?,uiolabv,1620472251,"Hell is a state of being. It is self exclusion from God because our decisions in this temporary life will determine our ultimate fate in the afterlife(i.e. if we choose to follow God or not). Despite hell being a place of torment, when God sends a person to hell it is still an act of mercy because a sinner when in the presence of God will only be MORE tormented in heaven than in hell. Not only that but because it is also God showing respect for the free will of human beings.

However since the soul yearns for God, it still feels tormented when excluded from God which is said to be the first pain a person in hell experiences. In hell you will be alone with the demons who torment you. Despite this it is better than a sinner being in heaven because the Holiness of God will only give more pain to the sinful soul. Which is why seeing God face-to-face in our state will result in our deaths.",Catholicism

What does everyone think about this morally speaking?,smpark12,1620450293,"This is a really stupid example but it got me thinking about the precedent that it sets

Let’s establish that this is a Catholic School, and I’m well aware that I’m overreacting. Some kid “destroyed” the bathroom at my school (Don’t know how bad it really was). One person is allowed in the bathroom at a time due to COVID protocols. They made a group the boys who went to the bathroom roughly in that time (all of them some of the best behaved kids in the whole school) clean it today when they literally acknowledged that some of those people were innocent. Then some of those kids are also getting in trouble with their parents for getting in trouble at school. For simply going to the bathroom. I would hope that the people in authority aren’t so stupid as to pick out good kids, and are trying to make the person who did it feel bad and turn himself in. I don’t think it’s very Christian to punish innocent people to try to punish someone who is guilty. I think that they should have asked for volunteers to clean it (I would have volunteered, never got the chance), and once they find out who did it, serve justice accordingly. I just wanted to know what everyone here thinks in the context of Catholic/Christian philosophy.  I don’t intend to make a big deal about this, at most I would send an email complaining about it, but I want to know what some people here think the right thing to do would have been.",Catholicism

Am I Supposed to be a Lesson?,5koalasinatrenchcoat,1620446787,"Hi.

I was taught God does everything for a reason. That horrible things happen as lessons and to incite compassion in us and the like. Like, sometimes a tragedy happens but that tragedy moves you to be closer to God. I don't know if I'm explaining right. But this is what I learned in CCD.

And it makes me wonder...all my life I've suffered. Abuse. R\*pe. Being disabled and autistic. Having an eating disorder that despite going to treatment residentially 4 different times I can't shake...and I'm just wondering now...maybe I'm one of those people meant to be a lesson in compassion or make them closer to God. 

I'm not ever going to actually kill myself....but maybe I'm supposed to succumb to all my illnesses and disabilities. Maybe that's God's plan and if it is I can't very well go against Him.

Papacy Questions (Non Catholic),Lopsided-Region-7417,1620439456,"I'm currently exploring the historical basis for the Papacy. I'm not Catholic, but I'm open. I think the Papacy is a big sticking point for me.

 So far in my research, I've come across the Liber Pontificalis and I find it very intriguing that both Linus and Cletus were ordained by Peter, but that Clement seems to have been given a particular commission by Peter. So the 3 of them can be traced directly to Peter. It's not Peter to Linus, Linus to Cletus, and Cletus to Clement. But it is mentioned that Peter gave Clement as distinct role. 

 Why then are Linus and Cletus both considered Popes, as well as Clement, instead of the position of Pope going straight from Peter to Clement? I know there are lists composed by later fathers which give that order, but it seems like Linus and Cletus could have just served as 'elders', as in a plurality of elders, even though they are called bishops (some do understand the terms episcopate and presbyter to be somewhat interchangeable, I have seen). Then, with this theory, as the office of bishop (episcopate) later became viewed as an office possessed by only one person in a given area, people looking back on the names of the ""bishops in Rome"" might assume that it must mean they each held the office of the singular bishop at different times in Rome. 

I'm wondering if perhaps the 3 of them - Linus, Cletus, and Clement - made up a plurality of elders in Rome at one point, but Peter intended that Clement follow in his position?",Catholicism

Question Regarding the Catholic Doctrine Represented in Horror Movies,Distinct_Break2478,1620429944,"Greetings! I'm an ex-Muslim atheist while my family is devout Muslim.

Yesterday I was rewatching the horror film ""The Nun"" and my mother was there too. Later, my mother questioned whether Christians believed that God was omnipotent. I said that yes, Christians do believe in an omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent god. My mother said that she didn't think so, given how things in the movie went. The door in the abbey being marked ""God ends here"" and a nun saying ""Then even God cannot save you"" don't really imply that the followers of the faith believe in an omnipotent god. 

There are other things I've seen in related horror films (like the Conjuring and Annabelle ones) which make it look like the Christian god cannot overpower the demons. No matter how hard the characters try (different prayers, holy objects like water or blood of Christ, pages of the Bible), the demon keeps finding ways to get to them. Muslims believe that if you recite a specific verse from the Qur'an, you will be safe and demons can't hurt you. 

I do understand that films may be a poor representation of the true doctrine of Catholicism. It is not my intention to hurt anyone's sentiments. But please do clearify how Catholics believe that God is omnipotent despite things like the statement ""God ends here"" written on that door. Please forgive any ignorance on my part. 

NOTE: I used the words ""Christian"" and ""Catholic"" interchangeably here as the Catholic faith is the one shown in horror films.",Catholicism

Do you think God will give you a spouse if you pray for one? I'm grieving really bad over my break-up so I'm also asking for some advice.,Comfortable_Phase_54,1620423455,"I know that this question doesn't have a straight answer. That we need (at least try) to trust in God's Will and accept his Will. For me, and a lot of others, this is sometimes a tough pill to swallow. 

I'm a man almost 45 years old. I'm more of a traditional person. In the culture I grew up in, but especially Catholic culture/tradition.  I can't imagine anything better than two people who get married and devoutly follow the same faith and live in that faith. However,  I can accept someone for who they are. To a certain extent. Meaning, we may not have everything in common. We can be different. But if she believes in something like abortion that would be a deal breaker. 

When I was younger, even 5-10 years younger, I was sorta of a ladies man. Being with beautiful women who loved me wasn't very difficult. Then i started developing some health problems and infirmities.  Nothing serious, but it definitely has effected my life. And I'm in a rut financially. It diminished my appearance which has made me severely insecure. And living almost poor has added to that insecurity. I'm in hole that is extremely hard to climb out of. It might take a long time, but I'm definitely trying. 

In so many ways, I thank God for this. Because it made me humble and it brought me closer to him. For this reason, I am grateful. 

However, I'm stuck in a life of severe insecurity. And especially in todays world, I can't help but think ""who would want me?"". A man who once was able to almost pick and choose. Now becoming a man desperate for someone who would love me. Without compromising my faith and not having to settle. I think settling is the wrong thing to do for anyone. 

Who is the perfect or almost perfect woman for me? It's easy for us to name a bunch of qualities we want in that perfect someone. A powerful mutual physical attraction,  humble, loyal, faithful, pure, traditional, devout Catholic, being in love, a love that can never be broken, best friends, best lovers, loving, affectionate, joyful, happy, Doesn't worship or care about money, poor inspirit, rich or poor, sickness or health... the list goes on. While some of these qualities are extremely important (based on your own preference) I truly just want someone who will have some of these traits, but ultimately love me to the fullest extent possible for who I am. And if someone can do that, I will love them 10x's more. 

The love I have to offer is rare. A woman who can match that love would be a dream come true. 

The thing I want most in life is to find my spouse. 

I met someone randomly, were I would never expect to fall in love with someone and it was love at first sight. The instant attraction and instant love was something you could only find in fairy tales. I've never seen a love like this before. It was too good to be true. She was almost perfect. She was the one who i've been praying for, for years. She was a miracle to me. We both called each other our miracle. 

When I say, ""almost"" perfect. There was some differences. Our hearts and even souls (if I can say that) connected like no other. But she was outside my religion. I think God blessed me with an understanding that not everyone has received this grace of knowing, or loving, or understanding, who Jesus is. Many Christians haven't been given this grace yet either. I've seen it happen with Christians. They say they believe and I will help them in their faith... then a year later they almost miraculous convert and start teaching me what I already taught them. Its a beautiful thing. 

I can understand that some people were raised and taught something different. They grew up in their own culture. And how can someone go against what their parents and family taught them, people they love, and a culture they love? I heard wonderful stories of successful marriages that started out like this. And I don't want to be someone to hold anything against anyone. Or judge them. I want to be able to love everyone and accept everyone for who they are. Good people. 

I'm not her savior or anyone savior, but I was a positive influence in my faith to her. She respected it and even loved it. I bought her a rosary and she loved it. She would buy me Catholic gifts. She wasn't ready to convert, and I never asked her to, but there was hope for her from everything I taught her and influenced her. 

Its easy for me to tell you all that the love she had for me was as rare as they come. I'm sure many people say that. But despite certain differences, she was my absolute miracle. This love that I said I have to offer, and that I want matched, she beat it. 

After a while we got engaged. We were both truly happy. 

However, without saying anything bad about her, she did have some personal issues. I wasn't perfect and I came with my own flaws, but the certain issues she had that she got through rough times in her life started to overwhelm the both of us. She wasn't able to get a handle on them no matter how supportive I tried to me. Instead of getting better, they got worse. And I feel so bad for her. But it got to a point that she was so overwhelmed and couldn't break free of them that it got worse and made our relationship extremely toxic. I begged for her to get help. I even begged for her to ask Jesus. I begged her for my help. But in the end it destroyed us. Her feelings began to change. She wasn't the same. After so much trying, I had to make the decision that for my own mental, physical and spiritual health, and hers.. I had to end it. As much as this pains me to say, it is best for her to take care of herself even if that means without me. Even if that means she'll meet someone else. 

I am destroyed. In all my life, in any other relationship I've been in, this has caused me more pain, suffering, grief, sorry, hurt, heart ache, etc. I have to also deal with the grief of being hateful, angry, jealous, etc. I don't wish this on anything. 

She was my miracle. She was the woman I asked God to give me. A love I've never seen before. A connection that simply doesn't exist. The only way I can make sense of this kind of love is that God answered my prayers and gifted me with her. He gifted the both of us. 

And now she's gone. I prayed for her almost everyday and still do. I prayed that she can get over her issues, I pleaded for Jesus to touch her heart, heal her, so we can be happy and live this life of rare love we both had for each other.  Even though her and I are over. And she may have moved on. I still pray for her. I surrendered my relationship with her to Jesus.  I surrendered my pain and suffering to Jesus. 

Every day I pray that God takes my suffering away, and every day I try to heal from my suffering. So I can get over her. They say time heals right? 

I can't help but feel so wounded. I tried so hard and dealt with so much. For her sake, and for the sake of us, I took the punches. I forgave her for everything no matter how badly I was treated. And now I'm the one in pain.. I can't help but cry out ""WHY?!"" Why didn't our love, a love that doesn't exist win? 

I can't help think how cruel. I prayed for someone like her and she was better than almost everything I prayed for. I prayed to God for yours for this girl. I can write a novel on her love for me and another book on our love as a whole. How can this be? Was she not who I asked for? Was this not God's answer to my prayers? Its hard to put into words, that this was a miracle for me. I can't even imagine ever finding anything that even comes close to it. I never have before and I've never seen anyone who has period. My only explanation is that it was a miracle and I thought God chose us for other purposes. We were each others miracle. For this to not have been true is mind boggling.  And now I just have to accept it. Again, I can't help but think how cruel. Did the Devil do this to me? As a mean joke?  Its the saddest thing. 

Every day I'm praying and every day through God's grace I'm trying to heal. I think I'm left with a scar for life, but I have to move forward. 

But now I'm back to square one. Praying for a spouse. I've talked to someone close to me that believed God has something even better for me. I've read somewhere that God doesn't have a plan B for you, he has plan A that he'll give you someone better for you. Better than you can hope for. I wish so much to believe this. While nothing is impossible with God, I have a hard time believing that this can happen again at the level it was or better. I feel like only a miracle can provide that because there's no other way. 

I pray at adoration. I pray at home. I pray hard. I sob. I plead. Especially with how cruel this turned out to be. I pray novenas. Lots of them. Including to Saint Raphael and Anna Marie Taigi who are supposed to help find a spouse. I like to put the work in, and give true devotion. I would rather sit in prayer for hours praying as many prayers and novenas and my body will allow than pile driver cement for 12 hours a day making all the money in the world. 

I know that it is God's will ,but do any of you believe God will give you that miracle spouse if you pray hard for it? 

I also ask for any advice on this matter and any advice anyone has for me to heal from my pain and suffering. 

I appreciate you all. And I appreciate any of you who read this whole thing.

Obsessed with Avoiding Sin,Metropolitaner1,1620422377,"Hello all,

I think I have a mild case of OCD (though I'm not sure if this is true). I've had it for a long time before I came back to Catholicism but its starting to affect my faith.

I often find myself worrying over the most trivial things regarding sin. For example, I worry about listening to modern music (not modern as in today's sense, but songs that are not hymns). 

I also convince myself that I haven't prayed right or I haven't got enough faith as I don't feel anything mildly different during prayer. 

I always get so overwhelmed with it that I give up praying and believing for a few days, maybe a week at the most, but I always come back as I feel an emptiness. 

I don't feel the same passion everyone else seems to have towards Catholicism and God. I love them both as I like to keep tradition and I have a deep belief in God but I get dismayed when I don't feel any overall passion.

Sorry for the long read. I've stressed myself out so much over this and I'm no longer sure what to do. 

Thanks.",Catholicism

What does it mean to be authentically Catholic? Courageous Living.,SaltyEels,1620422228,"In my view this is perhaps THE most pressing issue for the laity today, as we have seen several prominent American Catholic politicians rise to high offices while openly promulgating positions anathema to the church. It vexes me to see such people claiming Catholicism as their faith in one breath, while undermining it in the next.  Personally, I have found it necessary to remind myself of what it means to be an authentic Catholic and thought I might post these musings. To me, It means that I must have faith; not a blind faith, but rather one informed by reason. I believe in angels and the intercession of saints, the exquisite nirvana of the beatific vision, and that I participate in my own salvation by just actions. It means that on the day of my death I will be before Jesus, to receive my particular judgement. It means there will be an accounting of my life and all my shameful deeds will be laid bare. It means that though I am saved by Grace alone and are predestined for salvation, I may freely choose to reject this gift of Grace and face immediate and eternal damnation. 

It means to know and accept in my heart that I am a creature of God and am wholly subject to His divine will, which has been revealed to the world in divinely inspired scripture, oral tradition, and unerringly interpreted through the guidance of the Holy Spirit in the magisterium of His one, true, and apostolic Church which still endures today. If I am convicted of the truth of these matters, how I am called to live is abundantly clear. 

It is clear that if I am sincere in my faith, life on earth simply cannot be easy. It just can’t. Adversity is an expectation. For Catholics live in a world afflicted by poverty and iniquity, where secular authorities have codified and hailed grave moral evils as virtuous expressions of human rights and have propped up a culture of unbounded permissivity and licentiousness as false gods. All sincere Catholics need to remember WHY we’re here and WHAT we believe. 

I believe that to be authentically Catholic is to remember that we live in this world but are not of it and we can’t pick and choose which of God’s directives to adhere to. It really is all or nothing. Half-measures show an insincerity of Catholic belief or shows that we’ve forgotten the great Why of all things. And so, courage on our part is required. It takes great courage to defy the worlds expectations and remain steadfast and faithful in the face of the vehement denunciations Catholic social positions inevitably elicit from the general public.  In the end, we will all be judged by the strength of our courage, manifested in the world from our true belief in Christ’s redemption.",Catholicism
Catholic church questions the legalisation of recreational drugs.,zogins,1620421612,"A boy I know was caught with a joint in a Catholic school. The school called his parents and offered all sort of help to the boy but they did not call the police. They did what was morally right and refrained from ruining a good boy's future for a stupid mistake that is made by adoloscents.

However, our socialist government is now considering legalising drugs for recreational use. Rightly so, the Catholic Church, through its schools, has issued statements backed by scientific evidence questioning the wisdom of making drugs seem to be OK.

Whatever proponents of lagalising Marijuana say, it is a mind altering drug and apart from that, smoking it creates substances such as very fine particulate matter (PM 10) that are known to be hazardous to human health.

Think about it - if our governments could go back wouldn't they have nipped in the bud the spread of tobacco? So why are they creating a new problem?

Like you can’t do them sometimes and sometimes not. It’s either all or nothing for me otherwise it gets worse. Anyways 

So in March I told God I wouldn’t play video games that use God’s name in vain. I was getting excited to play the Mass Effect trilogy again, and I inspected a little of each game on YouTube to make sure there was nobody using His name in vain. 

Then I remembered that there’s an optional character you can have as a companion that uses His name in vain frequently. ☹️

So I’m like...do I play this game? Because I told God I wouldn’t play games that use His name in vain or do I play it and just not have that teammate? And because I didn’t check the entire game, do I just stop playing altogether if someone in the game uses His name in vain? Like a character I mean.


I hate you so badly OCD. I hate you I hate you I hate you. And I hate that it takes my genuine desire to avoid sin and twists it into a monstrosity that beats me up. I’m mad at myself for making this promise because it’s potentially taking away one of my favorite games. I was going to play it like a good Christian and make all the right choices. I’m feeling quite upset. And I’m mad at myself because I’m worried I’m upsetting God right now.",Catholicism

What about blood donation? That seems to be using a faculty in a way *contrary* to its natural end (veins are meant to keep blood in the body, blood is meant to stay in the body). It seems under a natural law view it would be intrinsically wrong to intentionally remove blood from the body, for any reason.

I’m trying to handle feelings of attraction wisely. Am I doing this correctly?,LoveByCandlelight,1620414321,"
I’m trying to live a mindful and God-centered life. I actually have privately consecrated myself to God and took on a private vow of chastity and union with God, similarly to a consecrated virgin, so this is important to me! I’m glad to have this opportunity to live my life in this way. 


I struggle, however, with a hurtful and painful attraction towards subjects and situations I *really* don’t want to be attracted to. I do not consent to the feelings, and I’d much prefer not to have them. I suffer from hybristophillia meaning I feel an attraction to evil beings, situations, and people. It stems from a attraction to the idea of someone hurting me in certain ways. It goes against my religious values! I’ve struggled with this since I was 13, and I’ve tried to see a therapist for it but it’s been a long time since I’ve discussed it with my current one. 

While I was doing a mindfulness exercise, I decided to just accept the thought. Not entertain it (because I don’t want to), but just accept that it’s there.  I kept trying to run from it and pretend it’s not there. So I made myself admit “I find x sexy.” I almost don’t want to say it, but x means Satan. And I hate it. Please don’t judge me. I don’t want this at all. 

But I didn’t like that wording so I tried to word it in a more nuanced way - that I feel this attraction and I’m not trying to foster it, that this is the cross I have to carry. So I thought to myself “God sees in my heart I don’t want these attractions.” But I mindfully accepted it instead of pretending it does not exist and frantically avoiding it. I don’t want to live in denial of myself. Am I handling this right? Again, I’m not even wanting the thoughts. I don’t want them here at all. I love God. Maybe I can prove my love for Him in managing these thoughts?",Catholicism

Psychology of Scrupulosity,7horus,1620413829," Scrupulosity is a manifestation of a psychological phenomenon called rumination, a pattern of deep repetitive thinking. Rumination is not a bad thing in and of itself, but when it manifests as scrupulosity, it takes the form of compulsive repetitive thoughts such as thinking about past thoughts and actions over and over again to determine if they offend God, or to repeatedly think about what horrible things could await in Hell. While thoughtful reflection is beneficial for thinking of how you should be morally acting as a person, scrupulosity can be intensely frustrating and often makes it harder, not easier, to act as a moral person.

I found this video very helpful as it proposes methods to combat this repetitive thinking. It is not from a religious perspective per se, but I found that the principals apply to scrupulosity so I wanted to share it here. Feel free to DM me if you want to talk more about this :)

Catholicism and Medicine in the Dark Ages,Colonel-Infernal,1620406164,"I've been taking part in a healthcare science class for the past semester, and one of the earlier segments was on the history of healthcare. The segment describing the ""Dark Ages"", in which it's referring to the years 400-800 AD, seems as though it might be rather derogatory to the Catholic Church's involvement. It describes the period as this:


1 - ""Emphasis was placed on saving the soul and the study of medicine was prohibited.""


2 - ""Prayer and Divine Intervention were used to treat illness and disease."" 


3 - ""Monks and priests provided custodial care for sick people.""


4 - ""Medications were mainly herbal mixtures.""


5 - ""Average life span was 20 to 30 years.""



The last one is in contrast to the previous ""era"" mentioned focused mostly on the developments made by Ancient Rome, which refers to 753 BC to 410 AD. It regards the average life span of that period as ""25 to 35 years.""

"Ideas for ""safe"" rosary beads for a lady with dementia.",CassCat,1620403919,"Hello all, 

Does anybody know where I could obtain ""safety"" rosary beads that could be used with adults with cognitive disorders? They would have to be non-chokable and with some type of safety release where the user couldn't accidently get them wrapped around his/her neck. 

I work with Long Term Care patients, and one of our new admissions has severe dementia, but finds it comforting to hold her rosary, and sometimes goes through the motions of saying the rosary. It is one of the few activities that she does independently, and is otherwise very silent and passive. 

She is relatively young for such severe dementia, and her body is strong. She likes to manipulate objects in her environment, and will pick at/take apart anything she can get her hands on. She also has a history of eating things that aren't food. Her nurses are afraid to give her the beads, for fear that she will pull the strands apart and choke herself on the beads. Supervision is provided, but she is a relentless fidgeter and it's impossible to have eyes on her every minute of the day.

I've seen many variations on rosary beads over the years, but haven't come across anything matching that description.

Can anybody think of a solution that would allow this lady to continue using her rosary beads? It makes me sad to think that she could be deprived of something that continues to connect her to her faith.",Catholicism

I'm afraid for Quebec's faith... (useless rant),Professional-Act2899,1620397830,"I need to vent about the situation in Quebec. It's worst than most imagine. Quebec, the french speaking province of Canada, was once a place where the one true faith was well established and flourishing. Then came what is known as the 'quiet-revolution', and the faith slowly died out.

Today, our Chuches are closing down, Mass attendance has dropped to a new low and the population is becoming more and more anti-Catholic every decade.

Anti-Catholic false history is being taught in schools, new laws prohibiting some people from wearing a cross in public are being put in place, crucifix are being taken down from legislative buildings, etc.

A lot of street name who were named after Saints are being renamed after famous persons or the like in order to erease as many traces of our faith as possible.

But the worst is not what is happening on the outside of the Church. The worst is what happening on the *inside* of the Church.

I have had priests try to convince me that all are saved, or that once someone is saved that person is always saved and other protestant heresies.

I have learned that the most popular University for learning theology is the University Laval, in Quebec City, where most priests go. In their theology program, some courses are being taught by protestant Universities. 

Theology here is thin and dumbed down to a level that is almost insulting. I have stopped asking guidance from priests in Quebec years ago and bought the entire Summa Theologica.

*A lot of Catholics* are into conspiracy theories, false prophecies and false revelations. In fact, false revelations like those of Luisa Piccarreta and Vassula Ryden are so popular here, it's troubling. People no longer read the Bible, they read false revelations. Parishes and priests are encouraging people to read those false revelations which are full of heresies and deceptions even tho the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is opposed to them.

The Charismatic movement is so popular here, that I'm starting to wonder if speaking in tongue is not necessary for salvation... /s

Last but not least, some very popular priests have started to openly position themselves as pro-Gay and pro-Gay marriage. The crowds are cheering, and they love it.

Anyone who's faith is remotely orthodox is a rigid trad and better be loving silence and solitude...

To me, the situation is clear, we are heading towards a situation similar to that of Germany. A schism is surely coming to Quebec; this is not a prophecy, it's just plain obvious to me.

If I have one piece of advice for anyone looking for a new home; don't come to Quebec.

Sometimes, leaving the province seems like the only sane thing to do. One of my friend just left the province and i'm envious. 

Because I'm tired of being alone in the Church I love.

I'm tired of being rejected and shunned by the people who supposedly share my faith and who then faithfully pray for the outcasts and the excluded every Sunday...

I'm tired of being told by my brothers and sisters to stop talking about these things because it's 'depressing'.

So I have decided to listen to them and I have decided to stop talking to other Catholics (from around here anyway). I have started to talk to Mary, our blessed mother, instead. She will listen, she understands, she knows.

Litany on Behalf of Our Country,Child-of-Sky-Vault,1620397540,"\[The following litany, originally said by English Catholics in 1840, can be said for any nation. This Litany is a timely Catholic prayer we should say often, imploring God's mercy for the conversion of our country.\]

*Lord, have mercy on us.*  
*Christ, have mercy on us.*  
*Lord, have mercy on us.*  
*Christ, hear us.*  
*Christ, graciously hear us.*  
*God the Father of heaven, have mercy on us.*  
*God the Son, Redeemer of the world, have mercy on us.*  
*God the Holy Ghost, have mercy on us.*  
*Holy Trinity, one God, have mercy on us.*

*O God, who hast been pleased to magnify Thy name amongst our ancestors, and to distinguish them by the particular marks of their piety, continue the same mercy to us, we beseech Thee: that now, in these days, we may seek Thee with all our hearts, and zealously labour to copy the examples which our forefathers have left us. Amen.*

*For this end, we most humbly implore Thy goodness to have compassion on this our country, and by Thy powerful grace to remove from it whatever is provoking or displeasing to Thee.*

*Have mercy, O God, on this nation. And be Thou its powerful deliverer.*

*From infidelity and profaneness,*  
***Deliver us, O Lord.***  
*From all irreligion, and contempt of Thy sacred mysteries,*  
*From all presumption, and the abuse of Thy holy word,*  
*From all heresies and schisms,*  
*From gluttony and drunkenness,*  
*From the profanation of Thy holy name, in cursing and swearing,*  
*From all kinds of prodigality and sensuality,*  
*From frauds, and all kinds of oppression and injustice,*  
*From the spirit of faction, of malice, hatred, and every kind of uncharitableness,*  
*O God, Thou hast been a Father to this nation, and replenished it with many blessings. --Forsake it not now, we beseech Thee, and give it not up to a reprobate sense.*  
*Bless this people, O Lord, and be Thou their inheritance.--And sanctify us, and make us a holy nation.*

*Give to all its inhabitants, O Lord, the spirit of the gospel,*  
***Hear us, O Lord.***  
*Give to them a zeal for unity, peace, and truth,*  
*Grant that they may all seek the things that are above, and walk by the spirit of Christ,*  
*Grant that all who are in error may, by thy heavenly light, be led into Thy truth,*  
*Grant that all sinners may be truly converted, and, forsaking their evil ways, return to thee their God,*  
*Grant that all scandals may be removed,*  
*Grant that the pastors may become the light of the world,*  
*Grant that all magistrates may administer justice,*  
*Grant that all of the wealthier ranks may esteem virtue their greatest honour, and be ashamed of vice,*  
*Grant that the youth of both sexes may be withheld from all evil ways, and that they may dedicate their lives to virtue, piety, and religion,*  
*Grant that all obstinacy and blindness may be removed from the hearts of this people, and that, being reformed according to Thy blessed will, they may serve Thee in holiness and truth.*

*Hear us, O Lord, now calling on thee.--And, through the infinite merits of thy only Son, grant our petitions.*

Let Us Pray:

*O* Almighty and everlasting God, who hast forsaken many Christian nations, and, in punishment of their sins, hast suffered them to be overrun by error and infidelity; grant, we beseech thee, that the rigour of these Thy judgments may strike us with a timely fear, and that, in earnest forsaking our evil ways, we may find mercy with Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

*R*emember, we beseech Thee, Thy ancient mercies, and for the sake of so many holy servants, who have been faithful to thee, shew now compassion to us, and let Thy former mercies be renewed in us.--Hear us, O Lord, and in Thy mercy grant our petition.

*G*ive ear to us, O God, here assembled before Thee, humbly prostrate in the confession of our unworthiness, and wholly confiding in Thy goodness and mercy.--Hear, likewise, O God, all those Thy Saints who, in this country, have faithfully served Thee, and are now happy with Thee in heaven.

*H*ear them praying for their country, and let their intercession prevail, through the merits of thy only Son, through which alone All prayers, whether on earth or in heaven, can find acceptance with Thee. Amen.

Let Us Pray:

*O* God, by whose mercy the world subsisteth, and to whose power every nation of the earth is subject, have mercy on this nation, we beseech Thee, and, according to its necessities, which are all known to Thee, so pour forth Thy blessings on it that, by the help of Thy grace, it may in all things be well-pleasing in Thy sight; through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

***Prayers for the Conversion of a Nation:***

**First prayer:** ""Almighty and eternal God, who wisheth to save all, and wilt have none to perish, have regard to those souls who are led astray by the deceits of the devil, that the hearts of those who err, rejecting all errors, may be converted, and return to the Unity of Thy Truth, through Christ, our Lord. Amen.""

**Second prayer:** ""Remember, Mary, tenderest-hearted Virgin, how from of old the ear hath never heard that he who ran to thee for refuge, implored thy help, and sought thy prayers, was forsaken of God. Virgin of virgins, Mother, emboldened by this confidence, I fly to thee; to thee I come, and in thy presence, I, a weeping sinner stand. Mother of the Word Incarnate, oh, cast not away my prayer; but, in thy pity, hear and answer. Amen.""

""*O* Mary, Mother of Mercy, Help of Christians, Refuge of Sinners, lest I perish, take upon thyself the care of my salvation, and the salvation of all those in whose behalf I implore thy powerful mediation, in order that all may be brought to the One True Fold, in which Jesus Christ, thy Son, wishes us all to live and die. Amen.""

""*O* Mary, conceived without sin, pray for the conversion of this country.

""*Q*ueen of Apostles, conceived without sin, pray the Lord of the harvest that He send laborers into His Harvest."" ""Our Father,"" ""Hail Mary,"" ""Glory be to the Father,"" etc.

What actually is an ecstasy?,needivinemercy,1620396883,"How does the church define ecstasy? I've heard of saints experiencing this and even some ordinary people. I'm curious as to know whether this is an experience you have had, and what it was like. 

I'm asking because there are moments I've had in prayer when I can feel the presence of God so tangibly that I feel like I'm 'swooning'. I don't lose track of the place I'm in or anything like that, I don’t see any visions, but I'm just able to experience the presence of God in a very powerful way. This 'swooning' happens rarely during deep prayer when I am the closest with God. But it has happened enough times for me to take notice, and sometimes it has felt as if my soul is being drawn upwards to heaven itself.. it's difficult to describe and of course I am wary that I could be imagining some of it.

"I love the fact that the calendar that Pope Gregory introduced in 1582, is now used by most of the world",TJB74,1620390034,"Introduced as a minor modification of the Julian calendar used widely in the ancient Roman Empire as they had overestimated how long Earth took to orbit the sun, not by much, but this had lead to calendar drift making it difficult to calculate the date of Easter. The new calendar added a leap day to  February every four years which counteracted Calendar Drift.

The reform was adopted initially by the Catholic countries of Europe and their overseas possessions. Over the next three centuries, the Protestant and Eastern Orthodox countries also moved to what they called the Improved calendar, with Greece being the last European country to adopt the calendar in 1923. During the 20th century, most non-Western countries also adopted the calendar, at least for civil purposes, with Saudi Arabia following in 2016. 

Most countries now use the Gregorian Calendar as their official calendar. The Chinese Lunar Calendar is still used for celebrations around Asia. Afghanistan and Iran use a Solar Islamic Calendar, Ethiopia a 13 month calendar and Nepal a Hindu Calendar.

Should I stop playing Genshin for being a Chinese game?,uiolabv,1620387884,"China is said to persecute Catholics and other sinister activities. With this in mind, I was wondering if Catholics should boycott China. There is a so called ""Remote cooperation in evil"" which falls under mediate; and mediate falls under material. To summarize,  


Cooperator &gt; Material &gt; Mediate &gt; Remote   


Cooperator - The one who assists the evil doer in some way  
Material - Does not intend the immoral act to occur. \*May be guilty in the immoral act.\*                         

Mediate - Providing the material not necessary for the immoral act to occur. \*May be guilty of the immoral act.\*

Remote - Makes a contribution to the act that does not lead to the commission of the act. \*Not guilty when there is a proportionately serious reason to do so.\*  


Because of this, any money spent on Genshin might be used for such immoral acts. Although I do not spend actual money on the game, I am still contributing by providing a platform for the game. What are your thoughts?",Catholicism

How to hear when God talks back? When saints talk back?,meiosisormitosis,1620362672,"Hi all. I’ve heard multiple times from a variety of people from a variety of religious backgrounds to not just pray at God or a Saint but to be in conversation. I remember specifically my parish priest saying that he “had many discussions with St. Boniface” and one time last month my bible study leader made us write a letter to God and then on the flip side made us *be* God and write back.  It’s always pained my heart that others are able to pray and hear a voice or feel something in return but I’m just not able to do that. I usually just sit in silence and clear my head (or try to) before saying “I’m going to be quiet and try to hear you answer”. Am I doing something wrong?

Important Questions on Demonic Possession and Obsession.,Joneswesting,1620340214,"I was wondering if anyone here could answer some questions I had on the subject. After doing some research on these subjects and reading some books from expert exorcist, I essentially wanted to know if it was possible to be possessed and not exhibit any of the obvious signs such as speaking in tongues, extreme strength, and other supernatural phenomena. I also would like to know whether or not it was possible for a possessed person not to react to holy water and not react to the Holy Eucharist. 

In other words could a demon be clever enough to remain hidden in a sense where he doesn’t exhibit those obvious very supernatural giveaways or do they all have that in common? 

If a demon was clever like this, would there be anything a priest could do to surface the demon or confirm its presence?

Also, I was wondering what good a demon gets out of possessing someone. Basically what can they do to that person that they can’t do with demonic obsession? Also if a person was suicidal, what impact would possession have on that? 

Lastly I would like to know if it is likely that say If someone did get possessed through engaging in an occult practice, would the demon/demons eventually just leave on their own without being forced to leave somehow, or would they naturally want to stay for as long as possible?

"Those of you who abstained until marriage, how did you do it?",AstronomerOk4608,1620330133,"Most people I know, including myself, did not abstain until marriage. Most people I know (catholics and other kinds of Christians alike) see absolutely nothing wrong with fornication. 

My question is, those of you who abstained until marriage, how did you do it? 

I have a teenage sister who started dating so I am trying to give her godly advice. She does not believe in Christianity, but she believes in God and in moral teachings. Her boyfriend is an atheist and well..... if Christian teens struggle with chastity, how much more a teen who doesn't believe in God? 

I'm wondering how can I give her practical, secular advice on why waiting until marriage is important. 

I've already spoken about how the natural outcome of sex is babies, and how even with birth control (which I also view as sinful), you can still become pregnant. So why risk that as a teen? 

I also explained to her the effects that birth control had on our society... Like abortion, unrestricted sex, broken marriages, the epidemic of porn, men and women using and abusing each other, sexual abuse/assault/rape, etc., etc. 

I also pointed out to her that I deeply regret my sexual past, and so have many of my cousins who had multiple or even many sexual partners regret it as well. We all regret how we fell for the lies of this world, that promised us that pre-martial sex is ""fun"" and ""natural"", and how we shouldn't ""repress"" our ""natural desires"". We are still dealing with some of these hurts that promiscuity caused us, even now as I am a married woman. 

I told her about why marriage is more than just a piece of paper. I gave her examples of all the women I know who are begging their boyfriends to propose to them, who are begging their fiancés to marry them, after living with them for years, after having babies, after purchasing a house together! These men still won't marry these women... That is because these men know how serious marriage is, and they have one foot in the door and one foot out by cohabiting. 

What else can I say to her? Those who practiced abstinence until marriage, what motivated and encouraged you to do this?",Catholicism

"What Catholics Can Do to Engage the ""Lost""",Stella_Maris_12,1620324201,"People still seek peace, because the secular, “woke” mentality is telling us to have more things, to put ourselves in the first place before helping others, to take instead of giving of our hearts, yet at the same time there is a real desire for self-knowledge, to heal from emotional wounds and trauma, to accept other people and re-humanize the marginalized. There is a stirring in hearts to find truth that is unchanging, because it is downright confusing to say that evil and good are open for interpretation. The human conscience is still crying out for justice, even if our idea of justice is being morphed into something anti-community and anti-God. And we are desperate for close human connections, for grounded, holy friendships. We have to reeducate ourselves on how to form those, and we can. We will.

There is such an incredibly strong link and overlap between those who have grown up Catholic or just Christian, with a strong faith in God or at least a desire to remain in faith, and those who have no religious affiliation and/ or atheist, the “nones.” The reason I say that is because most people have not really experienced the love of God, and everyone acts and thinks like there is no God at one point or another. That is the reality of the world we’re living in. The response most Catholics and Christians have is to despair over the unprecedented division of the world and the anti-Christ sentiments preached to us everywhere you turn, or to rant about this generation of young people, and to lose hope. But the real fact of the matter is, now more than ever, the Gospel is at the center stage of humanity, and it still has the power to transform and convert hearts, because that is the will of God for our times.

During the ""Warring States (Sengoku) Period"" in Japan, there was a lot of trade between Japan and Portugal and Spain.  
At that time, Catholicism was beginning to spread in Japan.  
However,  Portuguese merchants continued the slave trade in Asia for a long time,  ignoring European rules, even though the slave trade was banned in  Europe.  
And they sold poor Japanese as slaves to other countries.  
Meanwhile, Catholic priests and Portuguese consuls in Asia continued to affirm the buying and selling of Japanese slaves.  
This was in spite of the fact that they knew that the slave trade had long been banned in Europe.  
Also, the Catholic priests, except for the Jesuits, were arrogant and pompous.  
The  Catholic priests, excluding the Jesuits, insisted that the Portuguese  colonial policy was the right one, even in front of the Japanese  authorities.  
Toyotomi  Hideyoshi, the supreme authority of the time, was so angered by Catholic  priests (only the Jesuits were a little wiser) who affirmed the buying  and selling of Japanese slaves and cooperated with the colonial policy,  that he banned the spread of Christianity.

This post covers the papacy during the Monothelite and Iconoclasm Controversies (roughly AD 620-825)**.

I'm continuing to share my personal notes and thoughts on [The Papacy and the Orthodox](https://www.amazon.com/Papacy-Orthodox-Sources-Historical-Theology/dp/0190245255) by Ed Siecienski.

*Personal Conclusions*

* Lateran 649 is an interesting historical case of the Roman church believing it had the power to call councils which were binding for the whole church.
* The monothelite controversy overall increased Rome’s stature, and continues to show Rome acting with universal authority in the church.
* The case of Honorius is perplexing. It is unclear whether he was a material heretic at all (Maximus and his immediate successors did not believe Honorius intended heresy), and he died before any clarification or self-defense could be given. In official statements of Roman teaching, the Popes were always on the side of orthodoxy. His later condemnation at the council is a blow to Papal reputation, but seems to merely show that either (1) Popes can err in private correspondence, or (2) the condemnation was a disciplinary action that misunderstood Honorius’s intent.
* Maximus the Confessor is one of the few Eastern fathers who seemed to have an unambiguous position in favor of the Papacy. Attempts to “soften” his position seem to fail in my judgment; his position may not be explicitly V1, but it isn’t far off from it either.
* Throughout the monothelite controversy, we see Popes excommunicating and deposing patriarchs, holding “ecumenical” councils with binding decisions, and promulgating definitive teaching to the world (especially at the Lateran Council). We once again have the East falling into heresy after heresy while Rome holds the orthodox line.
* The coronation fo Charlemagne gave the Pope some freedom from Eastern imperial affairs, at the cost of involving him heavily in European political affairs. This affair marks the Pope claiming the authority over the installation of emperors.
* The Popes resisted the addition of the *filioque* at first, not because they disagreed with its doctrine, but because they (1) resisted Charlemagne’s attempt to politically influence the papacy, and (2) were not comfortable adding to the decrees of an ancient council.
* The Iconoclasm controversy brings up interesting questions about what makes a council “ecumenical” or “binding.” Eastern fathers and bishops explicitly claimed that it cannot be done without the participation of Rome.
* Theodore the Studite seemed to clearly hold a view of Roman primacy that nearly matches those of V1.
* The East in general had to turn to Rome for help during Iconoclasm, as the East was embroiled in conflict. This led to many in the East explicitly speaking of the necessity of Roman approval for doctrines and dogmas, in order to combat “robber councils” in the East who acted independently (though on behalf of imperial will) to condemn images.
* This period generally served to increase the statue of the Papacy. Even with the issue of Honorius, the Papacy continues to emerge as an essential institution in Christendom to protect orthodoxy and give order and unity in the church. The East itself continues to turn to Rome for assistance, often praising and teaching about Rome in terms that are very comfortable to Western ecclesiology, but not admittable in most Orthodox ecclesiologies.

*Now on to detailed notes from each section...*

*The Byzantine Papacy and the Monothelite Controversy*

* During the early seventh century the reputation of Rome in the East continued to grow, as the rising Persian power and the threat of heresy forced many prelates and priests to turn westward. Appeals to Rome continued, the Verba Seniorum telling of two monks who traveled “to the most high archbishop of the city of Rome” (ad summum archiespiscopum Romanæ civitatis) so that they could bring their case directly to the pope as “head of all” (caput omnium).
* However, two centuries after Chalcedon, its theology continued to be controversial. An Eastern formula to aid unification, drafted by Patrius Sergius et al., spoke of “one theandric energy” operative in the person of Christ, which initially satisfied all sides until it was rejected by Sophronius of Jerusalem.
* Sophronius wrote to Pope Honorius for his condemnation. However, Pope Honorius (625– 38) was not the ally for which he had hoped. In fact, in a letter to Patriarch Sergius, Honorius seemed to posit that Christ not only had one energy, but also one operative will (“ unde et unam voluntatem fatemur Domini nostri Jesu Christi”), a phrase with clear monophysite overtones. 9 The monothelite controversy had begun.
* Maximus the Confessor
   * Maximus could not believe that Honorius was a monothelite, and contended that the unsuspecting pope had blithely signed a document that neither reflected his true views nor translated them very well into Greek. 12 Maximus’s trust seemed justified when Honorius’s successor Pope Severinus (638– 40) refused to sign the monothelite Ekthesis issued by Heraclius, instead gathering a synod in Rome to condemn it.
   * In a letter written around this time (c. 640), 14 Maximus addressed Rome as the “first of the churches” (princeps ecclesiarum), the “greatest and apostolic Church” (maximae et apostolicae ecclesiae) and the “firm and immovable rock” (firmae revera et immobilis petrae).
   * Maximus: If even the weak defend the faith when attacked, “how much more in the case of the clergy and Church of the Romans, **which from old until now presides over all the churches which are under the sun? Having surely received this canonically, as well as from councils and the apostles**, as from the princes of the latter \[i.e., Peter &amp; Paul\], and being numbered in their company, **she is subject to no writings or issues in synodal documents, on account of the eminence of her pontificate even as in all these things all are equally subject to her according to sacerdotal law**.
* Greek-speaking Pope Theodore (642-49) continued his predecessors’ fight against monothelitism. The Romans believedthat as a convinced Chalcedonian “the new pope had the skill needed to disentangle the subtle linguistic machinations… \[that\] the Romans believed had snared the unfortunate Honorius.” **He did not disappoint, and excommunicated the monothelite Patriarch Pyrrhus and deposed Pyrrhus’s successor, Paul II**.
* While Emperor Constans II (641– 68) issued a Tomos halting all talk about “one will and one energy, or two energies and two wills,” the Romans “rais\[ ed\] the battle cry against Constantinople” and chose the former apocastarii Martin (649– 55) as Theodore’s successor, consecrating him without the imperial approval they knew they would never receive.
* Lateran Council 649
   * With the assistance of Maximus, who had spent many years preparing for such a gathering, in 649 Pope Martin convened a synod at the Lateran Palace at which three Constantinopolitan patriarchs (Sergius, Pyrrhus, and Paul II) and Cyrus of Alexandria were all condemned as heretics. At the synod Rome’s orthodoxy and authority were boldly trumpeted by all, Stephen of Dora calling it “the supreme and sovereign See… that rules and presides over all the others.” For Stephen Rome’s authority was solidly grounded in “the truly great Peter, the head of the apostles, \[who\] was deemed worthy not only to be entrusted, alone out of all, with the ‘keys of the kingdom of heaven’… but also because he was the first to be entrusted with shepherding the sheep of the whole catholic church.” **When the synod concluded, Martin forwarded the Acta to ecclesial centers throughout Christendom, asking that they hold similar synods to uphold the council’s decisions, an act that “sent forth a resounding statement of papal primacy and the pope’s authority as the prime guardian of orthodoxy in the universal church.”** 23 The question this raises is whether Pope Martin believed the Lateran Synod to be a genuinely ecumenical council, for **this would have directly challenged the long- held and universally recognized right of the emperor to call such a gathering**.
   * Both during and after the synod, Maximus’s and Martin’s actions— following the procedures of the earlier councils, the circulation of the Acts, even the vain appeal for imperial recognition they knew Constans would not provide— all **indicate that in their minds this gathering was ecumenical** despite the conspicuous absence of any bishop (save Stephen of Dora) from an Eastern see.
   * For Maximus the orthodox faith, not imperial recognition, dictated the legitimacy of councils. Maximus and his Roman allies “were claiming nothing less than a revolutionary role for the papacy… boldly challenging the emperor’s authority to supervise and direct divine matters. Rome could now act alone to impose its exclusive authority over the entire church.”
* Maximus the Confessor on Rome:
   * “For the very ends of the earth and those in every part of the world… look directly to the most holy Church of the Romans and its confession and faith as though it were a sun of unfailing light, expecting from it the illuminating splendor of the Fathers and sacred dogmas.… All the churches of Christians everywhere have held the greatest Church there to be their sole base and foundation, since, on the one hand, it is in no way overcome by the gates of Hades according to the very promise of the Savior, but holds the keys of the orthodox confession and faith in Him… and, on the other hand, it shuts up and locks every heretical mouth that speaks unrighteousness against the Most High.”
   * Elsewhere, Maximus wrote that **anyone who anathematizes Pyrrhus’s enemies (e.g., the pope) “also anathematizes the See of Rome, that is, he anathematizes the Catholic Church**. I need hardly add that he excommunicates himself also, if indeed he is in communion with the Roman See and the Catholic Church of God.”
   * Detailing the conditions under which Pyrrhus could return to the church: “Let him \[i.e., Pyrrhus\] hasten before all things to satisfy the Roman See, for if it is satisfied, all will agree in calling him pious and orthodox. \[For\] He is only wasting words who thinks he must convince or lure such people as myself, instead of satisfying or entreating the blessed pope of **the most holy catholic Church of Rome, i.e., the Apostolic Throne, which is from the incarnate son himself and which, in accordance with the holy canons and the definitions of faith, received from all the holy councils universal and supreme dominion, authority, and the power over all God’s churches throughout the world to bind and loose**.”
   * Historically **many Orthodox have been skeptical of the authenticity of these writings of Maximus**. More recently, Orthodox scholars such as Jean- Claude Larchet and Andrew Louth have taken a different approach, contextualizing Maximus’s great “enthusiasm” for the papacy as expressed in these selections in light of the “the glow of gratitude he must have felt following the Lateran synod, for the support he had found in Rome.” This does not mean that Maximus was being disingenuous or indulging in rhetorical excess while denying Rome real authority. On the contrary, **for Maximus Rome was indeed the princeps ecclesiarum acting as a “reference and norm in terms of faith for the other churches” with the authority to bind and loose,” that is, to adjudicate exclusion from the Church and reintegration into it, not only with regards to bishops in his Church, but also patriarchs who erred in heterodoxy**.” This was why, for example, Maximus believed it necessary for the contrite Pyrrhus to make his way to Rome, since the pope alone had the authority to accept the Constantinopolitan Patriarch’s confession of faith.
   * One instances qualifies Maximus’s fervent praies for Rome. He was asked once what he would do if Rome embraced heresy, to which he replied: “The Holy Spirit, through the apostle, condemns even angels who innovate in some way contrary to what is preached.” **Maximus, it seems, had not yet made the leap from “Rome has not erred” to Rome “could not err.”**
* Third Council of Constantinople
   * Constantine IV wanted to repair relations with the West, and invited Pope Agatho (678-81) to send representatives to Constantinople. Pope Agatho insisted there could be no doctrinal debate since the matter had already been decided at the Lateran Council.
   * In many respects the Council of Constantinople was “another high point of Roman authority in the East,” 46 for not only did the emperor force the Eastern bishops to reject monothelitism in terms almost completely dictated by Rome, but also to acquiesce to the condemnation of every Constantinopolitan patriarch from Sergius (610– 38) to Peter (654– 66). Just as he had spoken through Leo at Chalcedon, at Constantinople “Peter spoke through Agatho.”
   * However, this Roman triumph came with a price— that is, **the conciliar anathema pronounced against “Honorius, the heretic”** who was listed alongside the monothelites Sergius, Theodore, Pyrrhus, and Paul as “the confirmer of heresy… who in everything agreed with them.”
   * Agatho’s successor, Leo II (682– 83), in giving his assent to the Acta, **did formally acknowledge the error of Honorius, who “instead of enlightening the Roman Church with apostolic doctrine, tried to subvert the immaculate faith by impious treason** (profana proditione immaculam fidem subvertere conatus est).”
* Council of Trullo in 692
   * Consciously adopting practices known to be at odds with that of the Roman Church (e.g., permitting married priests and prohibiting Saturday fasts), the council issued 102 canons touching all aspects of Christian worship, order, and practice. Pope Sergius I (687– 701) was appalled that his apocrisiarii had assented to the council’s decisions, and he refused to approve them.
   * Justinian, who had intended that the council be ecumenical, was furious and moved to have the pope arrested, but was forced to relent when his representatives met armed resistance. It was not until 711, when Pope Constantine (708– 15) visited Constantinople that “verbal assent to the Trullan canons, at least those that were not repugnant to Western usage,” was given.
   * Yet the reluctance of the popes and subsequent Western canonists to recognize the ecumenicity of the Council in Trullo did not prevent the Greeks from viewing it as such, testament perhaps to “the very narrow limits… \[of\] papal authority” in the East.

*Iconoclasm and the Franks*

* At the beginning of the 8th century, the Papacy was still evidently part of the Byzantine Empire, papal elections being confirmed by the emperor with the pope being involved in the ecclesiastical affairs of the Byzantine Empire as its senior bishop. By mid-8th century, with pressing local issues, the ties were growing thin.
* Emperor Leo III began a campaign against the icons and looked to the Papacy for support. Although a formal break over iconoclasm did not yet occur, the pope refused “to subscribe to the new imperial policy,” for which Leo was understandably furious. As had happened a century earlier during the monothelite controversy, the pope once again stood in opposition to the emperor’s religious policy at a time when many, but certainly not all, of the Eastern bishops were supporting his iconoclast agenda.
* Emerging powers in Western Europe caused political strife. When the Lombards threatened Rome, Pope Stephen II turned to Frankish King Pippin (d.768) seeking help. Pippin quite happily offered his services, forcing the Lombards to cede Ravenna and other territories to the pope, further increasing the size of the growing “Republic of St. Peter.” A grateful Stephen then anointed Pippin King of the Franks and patricius Romanorum, marking a “fundamental shift in relations between East and West.”
* Long thought the basis for the papacy’s claim to exercise political jurisdiction in Italy was the Donation of Constantine (Constitutum Constantini), a forgery that “asserted that before departing to Constantinople, the Emperor Constantine had handed over to his contemporary, Pope Sylvester, large, though unspecified provinces and regions in Italy… \[as well as\] the right to wear all imperial insignia and garments and to create consuls and patricians.” **However recent scholarship has dated the Donation to some point after Pope Stephen, and thus it is unlikely “that the papacy based its political conduct on the Constitutum Constantini in the eighth century.”**
* Emperor Constantine V (741– 75) convoked an allegedly ecumenical council at Hiereia (754), where 338 bishops, without papal representation or approval, anathematized all who, through the use of icons, “brought back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.” The council’s claim to ecumenicity, never a strong one given the **absence of four of the five patriarchs**, was quickly refuted by the iconodules, **Stephen the Younger (d. 765) maintaining that according to the canons “religious matters cannot be defined without the participation of the Pope of Rome.”** Later, at the Second Council of Nicea (787), the papal representative, John the Deacon dismissed Hiereia on the simple grounds that “neither the Roman pope nor the bishops around him cooperated in it, either through delegates or letter, which is the law of councils. Even the patriarchs of the East, from Alexandria, Antioch, and the Holy City did not approve it.” **According to Klaus Schatz, this statement witnessed to an “internal hierarchy” that recognized the role “of the entire pentarchy, not merely Rome… But Rome is singled out. It must ‘cooperate,’ the other patriarchs ‘approve.’”**
* Writing about the recently elevated Patriarch Tarsios (784– 806), Hadrian expressed displeasure at his continued use of the title “Ecumenical Patriarch,” for it implied a rank above all other sees, including Rome itself. Henceforth we advise your most merciful and imperial majesty, that he be by no means called Universal in your writings… Because if he be named Universal, above the holy Roman Church which has a prior rank, which is the head of all the Churches of God, it is certain that he shows himself as a rebel against the holy Councils, and a heretic. **For, if he is Universal, he is recognized to have the Primacy even over the Church of our See, which appears ridiculous to all faithful Christians: because… the holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church holds the first rank, and the authority of power, now and forever**.
* While the pope’s letters to the emperors were read out at the council in Greek translation, they were heavily edited with his criticisms of the ecumenical title and references to Matthew 16: 18 taken out.
* Charlemagne
   * Because the Empress Irene in Constantinople ruled in violation of Salic law (operative in the West since the time of Clovis), there were some who believed that the imperial throne was vacant and could be claimed. 98 The opportunity to do just that came in 799 when the Roman aristocracy deposed Hadrian’s successor Leo III (795– 816) on a series of trumped- up charges, and the pope turned to Charlemagne for help. Charlemagne knew that he could not sit in judgment of the pope— Alcuin of York (d. 804) had dutifully reminded him that “the first see could be judged by no one”— yet neither could he allow the situation to continue. Charlemagne therefore traveled to Rome in December of 800 and accepted Leo’s oath of innocence and had him restored. Two days later, at Christmas mass, a grateful Leo formally crowned him “Roman Emperor and Augustus,” anointing Charlemagne with oil and making his formal obeisance to him (as was the Byzantine custom). Einhard later claimed that Charlemagne was shocked by all this, and “far from wanting it \[had\] made it clear that he would not have entered the cathedral that day at all… if he had known in advance what the pope was planning to do.”
   * The Byzantine reaction to Charlemagne’s coronation was, according to contemporary sources, rather muted. Neither side took it to mean a challenge to the eastern imperial court.
   * It is impossible to overstate the ecclesiastical ramifications of Charlemagne’s imperial coronation, for it not only gave the pope the presumed right to crown and depose emperors, but it also destroyed the older order, replacing “the axis between Old Rome and New Rome with the one between the papacy and Northern Europe.” The popes continued to treat the Constantinopolitan emperors with the greatest respect, but the papacy’s process of extrication from imperial affairs that had begun just 50 years earlier was now complete.
   * Now of course, the Popes had to deal with Charlemagne meddling in church affairs. Charlemagne pressued Pope Leo to sanction the addition of the *filioque* into the creed.
   * Like Hadrian before him, Leo was in a rather awkward position— **on one hand it is clear that he accepted the theology behind the filioque, and yet its addition by imperial fiat seemed a direct challenge to the pope’s authority as head of the Church**. Against Charlemagne’s court theologians Leo argued that he would never presume to overrule the teaching of the earlier councils, for they “acted upon divine illumination rather than by human wisdom… and far be it from me to count myself their equal.” **Then, “out of the love he bore for the orthodox faith,” Leo placed two silver shields in Rome with the un- interpolated creed in both Greek and Latin. The pope’s actions may have been motivated by love of the faith, but there is also little doubt that his true purpose was to remind Charlemagne who was ultimately responsible for the governance of the Church. Rome, not Aachen, was where the catholic faith was both defined and preserved.** The Franks, undeterred by papal opposition, continued to sing the interpolated creed during their liturgies, bringing this practice with them as they competed with the Byzantines for the souls of the Bulgars under King Boris.
* Iconoclasm resumed in the East under Emperor Leo V (813-20). In response the iconodules from the East again turned to Rome for assistance.
   * **Theodore the Studite** appealed to Rome in very high language: “**to Peter or his successor must every innovation in the Catholic Church be referred.**”
   * Patriarch Nicephorus claimed, “**without them \[i.e., the Romans\] no dogma can receive definitive approbation or abrogation**, even those sanctioned in a preliminary fashion by the canons and ecclesiological usages,… for they preside over the episcopal office and they have received this dignity from the two leaders of the apostles.” In his efforts to battle iconoclasm, Nicephorus was embracing the long- held Roman belief that papal approval was a necessary condition for conciliar validity, and he was doing so using the principle of apostolicity rather than the principle of accommodation.
   * For Theodore the iconoclasts had “torn themselves away from the body of Christ, **from the Supreme See in which Christ placed the keys of faith, against which the gates of Hell, by which I mean the mouth of heretics, have not prevailed and never will until the Consummation**.”
      * Note from me: tihs “never will until the Consummation” is one of the few explicit Eastern statements of the indefectiability of Rome.
   * Siecienski: “**Theodore’s praise of Rome was a reflection of his need to enlist its support and the “glow of gratitude” he felt once he received it. To forget this context, and read Theodore as an advocate of a monarchical papacy, is to grossly distort his intent.** In fact, alongside his occasional rhetorical excesses vis- à- vis Rome Theodore continued to embrace the pentarchical ideal, referring to the “five- headed body of the Church.”
      * Note from me: I don’t know what supports this claim. Theodore praising the pentarchy in no way implies he didn’t actually believe, in a literal sense, what he said about Rome’s indefectibility, or the inability of dogmas being proclaimed without Roman approval. The contextualizing seems ad hoc.",Catholicism
Concerns regarding Converting to Catholicism,RancidWatermelon,1620307127,"Some additional thoughts I was having about Catholicism. That isn't mean to be a critique of the Church in any way shape or form.  

I used to go to a bible study lead by a charismatic evangelical Anglican (if such a thing is supposed to exist).

He was very firm, very plain in his beliefs, though he did like Happy Clappy music.

What I find is that I tune into Jesus when he says Love God and Love your Neighbour - on these hang the law and the prophets. It was man, who wanted law and rules and regulations in the old testament. It's not about what you wear or what songs you sing. It is about what is in your heart. 

Though I also believe in rebuking those who fall astray and draw them back into the presence of God. 

St. Paul is clear - if anyone preaches another gospel, let them be accursed.

Yet Churches, and Roman Catholicism is no exception, seem to love rules and regulations.

I tend to believe more in the personal relationship with Jesus Christ, believe confession is between me and the Father through Christ and no earthly man, believe that we should be looking to Christ - not to men, to teach us through the Holy Spirit, and believe that men are ultimately prone to error. Communion bread and wine is symbolism rather than consubstitution.

So there's some things that kind of baffle me about Catholicism. Though I am drawn to it.",Catholicism
Is this spiritual attack?,RancidWatermelon,1620306513,"I don't know how many people saw my previous post, but I am an Anglican who is looking at converting to Roman Catholic.

I decided it was about time to go to my first Catholic Mass last week.

Unfortunately just before I had to leave, there was an accident at home. I nearly stayed to sort everything else before coming to the conclusion that the issue will still be there after mass and it certainly wasn't life or death.

There are three things that seem to be possible here:

1) This is a random accident - though I tend not to like things that are too coincidental like that. 

2) This is God telling trying to stop me from going to Catholic Mass - though he is not the author of bad things happening.

3) This is the devil pulling me away from God - for if I had not gone to Catholic Mass, I would not have been able to attend Anglican Communion that day either.

This then brings up the issue of spiritual attack. I do feel that I am under attack. Bad things keep happening, and I continually have to overcome. 

I thought God was supposed to open doors, but that door was nearly closed. But God is not the author of bad things and if I take Ignatian Spirituality as an example, I might consider that this is from the devil.

And why should I be fighting the devil, if I am baptised and confirmed in the name of Christ, unless that baptism and confirmation under my Anglican past is somehow null and void? I consider Job, who's faith was tested, . His afflictions didn't stop him loving God and doing good. This affliction that I had very nearly did that. I nearly got caught up in worldly matters and nearly put God aside.

I can sense a loose connection with Christ and God, but I know he's asking me for more. He's asking me for so much more. It's like I'm trying to tune into the radio and keep stopping at each station I find which sounds interesting, but it's not quite the connection I'm looking for. I can't hear God through static. Maybe I need to adjust my antenna.",Catholicism

Could Mary I of England have been a victim of the Black Legend?,albieparker16,1620305035,"I think we all know the story of Mary I of England, the last English monarch of Catholic faith who is infamously remembered by many as ""Bloody Mary"", as the queen who waged a fierce persecution against Protestants in England and wanted to re-establish Catholicism, unlike her half-sister and successor, Elizabeth I, who is remembered as ""the Virgin Queen"", who formalised the conversion of England to Protestantism and, apparently, led her country through an era of prosperity. However, given the existence of the so-called ""black legend"", I have begun to doubt what is said about both queens, both good and bad, and their respective roles in history: was Mary I really as bloodthirsty as she is said to be, and Elizabeth as magnificent a stateswoman as her sister?

The Concept of an Afterlife Perplexes Me,tx195,1620294425,"Let me preface this by saying that I was raised Catholic, was an altar boy and while I have fallen into sin in recent years I would like to go back to the faith. I accept the teachings of the Church. I believe in God as St. Thomas Aquinas’ Five Ways convinced me, particularly the argument from causation. I believe that Jesus existed and was crucified as even most secular historians do. The fact that the apostles were killed for defending the faith when they knew Jesus convinces me that there is a strong possibility He rose from the dead as I don’t think St. Peter himself would be crucified upside down over a lie as he himself supposedly denied Jesus three times earlier in his life over fear. 

However the one thing that was always hard for me to believe is that when I die there is an afterlife, Heaven or Hell. I remember being in surgery out cold but when I was on anesthesia my consciousness didn’t seem to exist at that moment. I just blanked out and woke up as if nothing happened for those 3 hours. My brain was still working and my heart was pumping though. If something went wrong during surgery and I died would I have all of a sudden regained consciousness in the afterlife by dying? When my bodily functions no longer work I have to be honest and say I have no idea how it is possible I will still be conscious. We will have no eyes, no brain, no heart when we die. Can we not see in the afterlife with no eyes? Can we feel anything with no nerve endings? Can we be happy with no brain? Because on Earth we can’t. I’m just having trouble understanding the difference between body and soul because during my surgery I felt like I didn’t exist during that and so I’m worried that when I die I’ll just be dead and not even know it because my existence will be over just like before I was conceived.",Catholicism

Help with guilt tripping and ridicules,applery,1620293079,"I've been having a problem lately and i don't know what to do.

First off about me. I was depressed and had anxiety for about two years or more. I don't have a job, and I currently live with my family. Pre-COVID...my mom has cancer and between me and my 4 (2 adults, 2 minors) siblings, I was always the one who went with my mom to hospital to watch over her. Sometimes her hospital stay would be from a few days to almost over a week. I did all that because I was happily willing to help. My mom has since received treatment and is doing well now. All that hospital stay (late night nurse/doctor visits, only eating fast food every day, no entertainment, no wifi, no laptop, nobody to talk to) took a toll on my already poor mental health, which at that point I was trying to revive/recover. My mental health is pretty well now though, I think, but I no longer wish to put myself through that anymore not just because of the effects hospital stays have on me, but also because my mom even with cancer never stopped being rude to me. She believes that it was only right that I was the one to care for her because I don't have a job and that I don't have anything else going on in my life (because to her having a job means you're valuable). Take note, she says this without gratitude and to annoy me.

Now my dad is the one who needs surgery. My mom and my sister is forcing me and guilt tripping me to go. I know I'm going to suffer again, but if I were willing to go, I know God would help me. However, this time... with the guilt tripping and the ridicules about being jobless, I'm just so discouraged to go. I've been feeling guilty that I'm breaking the honor thy father &amp; mother commandment if I stay at home but I don't want to go to the hospital because I know I will suffer. I am being forced to go unlike last time I was willing to suffer because I wanted to help.

My question is: Am I being unreasonable, self-centered or am I just doing this for self-care and to avoid going insane again?

Religious assent and unpopular theology...?,gellyngo,1620278465,"While I hold to many of St. Thomas' teachings and metaphysics, I have many times favored the theology and theories of other unpopular teachers, like those of Scotus, Suarez, Bellarmine and others. They at times differed a lot from what is contained in the Catechism and other popular opinions held by Catholics today (laity and clergy), but I had thought it was fine to favor them since they had the support of many theologians/clergy in the past.

However, I had recently come across the idea of ""religious assent"" (something very new to me), in that, and I don't know if I understand this correctly or not, one must adhere to what is taught by the Ordinary Magisterium even though it was not infallible. And it seemed that the Catechism, favoring Thomas' theology as the de facto teaching, was a part of this. I didn't really understand and I couldn't find a good resource about it, so I am asking here.

Protestant With A Story/Problem,brothergr1m,1620276881,"Here’s my story. I started looking into church history and both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches.

I started with Orthodoxy first and when I decided to let the priest know I was interested in converting, the morning before Vespers I was reading in Micha and read about those who were burning incense to idols or icons (depending on your translation) So i decided to hold off b/c I was still not completely convinced that icons weren’t idols and they are central to the Orthodox faith and they burn incense to all the icons durning vespers and liturgy.

So I begain to think about Catholism b/c part of my family is Catholic but we hardly see each other. So I started visiting a Catholic Church nearby for a short time and during this time I learned about novenas.

So one night I decided to start a novena because of some health issues. I started it that day then that night I was rolling over in bed half asleep when I felt a powerful presence/impulse (not sure how to describe it) and instantly retracted the novena. I didn’t feel threatened just felt like that is what it wanted me to do. Then the feeling left and I went back to sleep.

So as a protestant you can guess how I would interpret this to events.

Church history leads me to believe that the Catholics and Orthodox are the original churches and where even one church for a long time, but my protestant upbringing has me interpreting the two above events as warnings to stay away. No idea what to do now.",Catholicism

Anxiety when waking up from sleep,Bubbbe,1620270194,"Whenever I wake up after my nightly sleep or a deep nap I usually feel refreshed and at peace. While I see that as a blessing and thank God for even waking me up, I still feel almost unworthy of my rest, like things are **too** good.

For some reason, I correlate those feelings with my faith. I think to myself how am I able to enjoy the sleep I get knowing who I am and the sins I've done. I don't know if I'm coming off as too pious, and I hope not, but it worries me that my sleep is undeserved. 

On top of that, as I wake up I start to immediately challenge my faith, usually along the lines of ""if that's how death is, why worry about hell/sins"". The death-sleep idea is just some theories I read over the internet, and while I know my faith teaches it not to be particularly true, it still irks me. It's hard reconciling the extremes of Heaven and Hell, knowing how fragile we humans are; I guess my personal ideas on the afterlife are more wishful thinking, so I really try to reinforce that those theories are wrong in my faith.

If anyone understands what I'm trying to convey please feel free to reply. I'm really looking for guidance on this subject. God bless.",Catholicism
The point of marriage?,brandonmjc1,1620269008,"I’ve been praying for months to know my vocation and have been in spiritual/vocational direction which have been rolled into one. Realistically, I have about two years before a serious decision about entering seminary should be made. I have made a visit and while I loved the atmosphere, if I am not called to marriage I think religious life might be more for me than priesthood. As I’ve persevered with this intention in prayer for many months more and more what I had understood as a direction towards what might be priesthood has lessened and lessened. I do plan on persevering for this timeline with this same intention. With that in mind, I see very clearly the purposes of priesthood and religious life. I understand that marriage is to get both spouses to heaven. However, I do not see exactly the point of a sexual relationship exhibiting the union of Christ here on earth. The more I have prayed, over time the more priestly life does not present itself. The more I have prayed, religious life itself for all its beauty has not called. The more I have prayed, the more content I have become with chastity and God has preserved me from sexual immorality. I have had a serious 1.5yr relationship in the past where my heart said yes to marriage. Now, as I pray and as I type, I do not understand that yes and in some ways would rather not want it. I do not understand the point of such intimacy with another person outside God. Why can I not accomplish a similar feat, by the grace of God, outside of marriage? Ultimately you all can not tell me my vocation. That’s not really what I’m asking, though I am asking for some understanding. However, I do not understand a general openness to marriage conflicting with a contentness of keeping perfect celibacy. In some ways, I do realize that myself gets in the way relating to trust and insecurity. To that, it pushes me towards wanting a relationship with Christ alone, more. To me, human attraction seems somewhat immature and lack of denial of self. Sexual desires do not really make much sense to me.",Catholicism

Heat in my hand when praying the rosary? Anyone else felt something similar?,enitsujxo,1620267195,"I was praying the rosary this evening, and after a few minutes I started feeling heat in the palm of my right hand which I was holding the rosary, specifically at the crucifix.

It was a nice feeling. The last time I prayed the rosary I has a similair heat but more mild. Another time I was praying the rosary in the seated position and the crucifix was resting on my leg I felt a brief moment of heat. Other than that it didn't happen before. My palm still feels really warm.

This kind of heat never happens when I'm holding any other object in my hand for a long time. So could this be  God (the Holy Spirit) doing that? Did anyone else ever feel something similar when praying the rosary?",Catholicism

"I don’t want to break my word to God or my mom, but I don’t know what to do?",LoveByCandlelight,1620261952,"Okay. I suffer from scrupulosity, so I just want to preface that. I’m doing what I can to treat it - like being exposed to discomforting situations without compulsion, I’m doing CBT, trying to live mindfully etc. 

I went to confession at a different parish, and the priest there was extremely kind to me. He was soft spoken, friendly, and he eased my anxiety. The church was peaceful and I like the way it looks. It’s really beautiful - secluded, in the countryside. When I left, I ended up crying and feeling at peace. I just can’t really connect with most of the priests at my parish. I tell them what’s going on during my confession and I just don’t really feel that kind of human contact. One of them doesn’t speak English as a first language, so that feels like a barrier and the other one I’m not comfortable sharing my emotional struggles with. They’re both great people, I just am not as comfortable with confessing to them. 

So I came home and told my mother I wanted to go to that parish but she dissuaded me, because there’s nice parishioners at the parish I was going to (true) so I just said I’d stick with the parish, and made that as a commitment by my word. 

But I kept having thoughts. You know, I’d confess having thoughts about death and hurting myself and it just rolled off the priests back. With no kind of warmth to be received and it felt like I was just ordering lunch at McDonald’s. “Hello, I’ll have an egg McMuffin and a side of I’ve been entertaining thoughts about wanting to die please. “

And I just don’t feel warm anymore about that parish. I don’t feel like I’m able to connect to most of the priests. 

So I figured it was okay if I just signed up for the parish I did like, so I registered. Then later it occurred to me “I made my word with my mom, and possibly God” then I started to worry, and the anxiety thoughts came, and the thought of death..if I go in this parish would I be sinning against God by breaking my commitment? I know I told my mom I wanted to go and she said “I want you to go where you’re happy.” And she’s not upset about it. But idk if I made that commitment to God too. I just don’t remember. I could have :( I’m sad",Catholicism

I guess in addition to what I already asked, this is as good a time as ever to ask: how can I get better at prayer in general?

Question about Canon Law 1065.1 and having baby before marriage.,Reservist6319,1620247986,"Background:

Hello. I am 22 years old and currently in a relationship. She is a confirmed Catholic and I was baptized Catholic as a baby but never received the remainder of my sacraments. I have spent the majority of my life Non-denominational Christian but Since dating my girlfriend, I have attended Catholic Mass exclusively for the past two years and have found my way back to wanting to join the catholic church and become confirmed. A few weeks ago we found out we were going to be having a child together and while we know this isn't the correct order to do things in we are both very excited and blessed to have this child but we need some guidance moving forward. We both strongly believe that two wrongs do not make a right. Because of this we simply are not going to move in together out of convivence without being married first but I am also worried that as she gets further along in her pregnancy, her being alone in the house could be a risk to her health and personal safety.

&amp;#x200B;

Question: I have done a little research into Canon Law and people who have had similar situations but cannot seem to find a straightforward answer. Would a situation like this be covered under Canon Law 1065? ( Catholics who have not yet received the sacrament of confirmation are to receive it before they are admitted to marriage \*if it can be done without grave inconvenience.\*) -Canon Law 1065.1

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Found out my girlfriend is pregnant. We want to get married properly. I am not confirmed Catholic but she is. Would Canon Law 1065 Allow for us to get married and let me receive my sacraments and confirmed post marriage so that we may move in together and I can take care of her and the baby?

Franciscan crown of Rosary post.,StJoseCupertino,1620241671,"This is similar to a rosary but is Franciscan and larger, and its more centered in the joys of Mary and Jesus. 

The story of the Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin dates back to the early 15th century. A pious young man named James had been accustomed to adorning a beautiful statue of Mary with a crown of flowers, which he had picked and woven himself. He later entered the Franciscan Order, but either because of a lack of time or permission, he was no longer able to continue this devotion. Distraught because of this, he decided to abandon the religious life and return to the world.

Our Lady then appeared to him and convinced him not to leave the order. She told him that he should not be downcast because he was no longer permitted to adorn her statue, for she would teach him a way to give her honor which was much more pleasing and meritorious. Instead of a crown of flowers, which quickly wither, he was to weave a crown of prayers, and these prayers could be offered at any moment. She then taught him the Rosary of the Seven Joys, adding that these prayers would not only form a more acceptable crown, but they would also yield innumerable graces for himself and others.

The promotion of devotion is attributed to Saint Bonaventure, Blessed Cherubin of Spoleto, John of Capistrano and Saint Bernardino of Siena to name a few. Saint Bernardino also had an apparition of the Virgin when he was meditating on the seven joys of Mary. This devotion is favored with many indulgences granted by the Popes.

The Seven Joys are:

1) The Annunciation

2) The Visitation

3) The Birth of Our Lord Jesus Christ

4) The Adoration of the Magi

5) The Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple

6) The Appearance of Christ to Mary after the Resurrection

7) The Assumption and Coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven

During Lent, pray the 7 Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary:  

The prophecy of Simeon

The flight to Egypt

The loss of the Child Jesus for 3 days

Mary meets Jesus carrying the cross.

The Crucifixion of Jesus

The body of Jesus is taken down from the cross and placed in the arms of Mary.

The body Jesus is placed in the tomb

&amp;#x200B;

Following a brief period of meditation on each mystery, one Lord's Prayer and ten Hail Marys are prayed in order. It is customary, after the seventh mystery, to pray two more Hail Marys to bring the total number to seventy-two in honor of the tradition that Mary lived for seventy-two years.",Catholicism

Help with my skeptic thoughts on Catholicism?,princessp15,1620235868,"Hello all - this is a long (and not very well organized) post, so please bear with me. 

My boyfriend is Catholic, and I am protestant (I attend a Cumberland Presbyterian church). Recently, we have really started discussing marriage and future aspects of life. We both have very similar values and beliefs. I have yet to find anything we really disagree on. We live about 15 minutes apart, both in great communities. If we were to get married, we would live closer to his community, as we both like it better (more people, closer to town, things to do, still close to my family, etc). We both want to go to church together, for sure, but he's never been to mine and I haven't been to his with him. 

My background: I have gone to the same church my whole life, and it is about 40 minutes from my house (my mom's family is from there and go to church there as well). I love my church, go every week, and am very involved in everything (Sunday school teacher, co-director for VBS, I volunteer at all events we host). It is a small church (75ish members, \~40-50 in attendance every Sunday) in a small community. As much as it breaks my heart, I don't intend on going to this church forever. I have never lived in the community it's in (I actually live in a different state, so I often felt pretty out-of-the-loop) and I think I'll end up moving further away from it than towards it. So logistically, it makes sense to eventually try out new churches (although if I really couldn't find anywhere that feels right or like ""home"", I wouldn't be against driving the extra time to my home church). I am for sure open to trying different denominations as long as I don't feel like I am being led astray.

BF's background: He has also gone to the same church his whole life. It is less than five minutes from his house. He hasn't been in over a year, and went sporadically before that (although I think he went regularly when living with his parents). He has a solid belief system, but I think has just fallen out of the ""habit"" of going to church. His church is very large, I'd say they have 150+ in attendance during one service on Sundays. His dad grew up in this church and he grew up in this church, so naturally, he wants his kids to grow up there, too. We have discussed it a couple times, and he is OK with trying out new churches together, but I know he really wants to stay with his church. 

I have attended Catholic church services before (at two different churches), and I have even been to the church he goes to before (not with him, but a couple years ago). I know several people in his community, but none very well. He is the second Catholic kid I have seriously dated (the only two boys I have ever seriously dated), and my mom makes jokes about me going after Catholics (lol), so I almost feel like I am being led to this faith for some reason. I admittedly do not know a whole lot about Catholicism and haven't done much research, which is a big reason why I'm making this post. It is extremely different from protestant churches, so naturally I have questions and concerns. I am going to list them here (in no certain order) in hopes someone can provide wisdom and encouragement. 

1. **There is no Sunday school for adults.** I know there are programs for kids, although I am not super familiar with them or their teachings (which is another concern), but I have not heard of any adults attending a Sunday school type thing regularly at a Catholic church. This may be a thing and I've just never heard of it, I don't know. But I learn so much more and so much better in a group environment. To me, Sunday school is encouraging, I grow closer to the Lord, I learn history, and it impacts my everyday life. This is very important to me. 
2. **I have never heard of a non-believer getting invited to and attending a Catholic church.** We should all be disciples of Christ and work to bring others to the Lord. At Catholic churches, everything is so uncomfortable and not welcoming (as opposed to most protestant churches I've visited). The atmosphere is just different. Everyone seems stuck up and very strict in the church (but completely different outside those walls). I definitely think church should be taken seriously and to heart, but the atmosphere should not be that uncomfortable. Not only is the atmosphere uncomfortable, but it does not feel like a family-type atmosphere at all. At my church (and another protestant church I've attended), you can just walk in and feel like you're loved and welcome. These are not the vibes I get from the Catholic churches I've been to. 
3. **Confirmation, Baptism, and First Communion are basically just age-dependent.** This is also a big deal to me. I know several Catholics who went through the motions ""because it was their turn"" who not only don't worship God, they don't even know that they believe in Him. To me, these things should be ones initiated by each person when they are ready. It seems almost disrespectful to go through all of that without being ready. 
4. **My (abusive) ex-boyfriend and his family attend this same church.** I wouldn't be scared of him or anything when I see him, I just think it'd be super awkward. Figured this was worth mentioning, but it's something I could probably get over. 
5. **The structure and contents of the service are extremely weird.** There were ""hymns"" kind of (but it just didn't seem to flow at all, and it felt strange), but there wasn't much singing, and the stuff they sung was weird. Then some lady sang for like a solid 5-6 minutes so loud and at a certain pitch that I literally couldn't understand what she was saying. Everyone just seemed to awkwardly stare in silence. The announcements were not of anything local, it just all seemed to be national or world wide stuff. No one mentioned any praise reports or prayer requests, which I feel like is important to keep the community in-the-know. The actual sermon lasted like 3 minutes. This whole description was how it felt at both Catholic churches I've attended. 
6. **Catholics are known for being heavy drinkers.** I see nothing wrong with drinking, but what really bothered me is when my boyfriend and his friend were telling me a story of how when they were in high school, they were at a party, and their Priest was there and left shit-faced drunk. This is a huge red flag to me. Everyone has their own problems, but to me, that is extreme and not tolerable for someone who is supposed to be leading the church. Maybe I'm being too judgmental here, idk...
7. **I do not believe I have to go through anyone but Jesus Christ to talk to God.** This point is a concern about Mother Mary and confessional. I don't think I hold Mary to as high of a standard as Catholics do. I do not have to pray through her to talk to Jesus. It may not actually be as big of a deal inside the Catholic church as it seems to be, but to me, there looks to be a lot of emphasis on her. I don't know that I agree with that, although I do agree that she should be highly regarded. As far as confessional goes, I think that my sins are between me and Jesus and whoever I am comfortable sharing them with. It is weird to think about sharing them all with someone else...
8. **Going to church seems to be optional.** Lots of Catholics I know go sporadically. Maybe that's not everyone and shouldn't be the vibe I get, but I don't know. I'm sure there are those who do go consistently, it just doesn't seem very common. I don't have anything against those who don't go regularly, but I grew up going every Sunday and that is how I am going to continue to go. This keeps me in a habit, and gives me somewhat of a ""refresh"" each week. 

I'm sure this is not all of my questions and concerns, but with my limited knowledge, this is what I could come up with. I feel like they all sounded very critical, but that's really not how I meant it. I am honestly just stating my concerns. I know so many intelligent, wonderful, God-fearing people of different denominations, including several Catholics. I just want to make sure I really understand everything and that I have the knowledge to really discuss things in depth with my boyfriend so that we can make the right decision for us. I would love to start going here since it means a lot to him, but I don't want to if I am not comfortable with the practices and beliefs.",Catholicism
"Question about sisters, nuns, brothers, and priests...",Lunarmoonbear,1620235389,"Okay, I know what a priest is. But the other sub groups of the church... what separates them? Like, is a consecrated single either a sister or brother? Is a brother a deacon? Is a sister a nun? 

As an outsider, I find the different groups fascinating. Also, what are their ""roles"" behind them? And what started them? What is the history they are based on? I'm so curious.

I don't mean to be rude. I find it beautiful yet something so unknown. Is it okay for me to ask such things?",Catholicism

Trying to find a church to get married at — am I asking too much?,ByGraceandGingham,1620231901,"For starters, we’re in a bit of a difficult situation. We’re planning on getting married the summer after our graduation from college (we attend the same Catholic university in Indiana and we’re both current juniors), and we’ll be moving to Indianapolis soon thereafter (I’m working remotely for a Texas real estate firm after graduation, and FH is graduating a semester early to start a job there). However, I’m trying to figure out how to start planning our wedding. 

My parents and I would like for me to get married in Texas, and at the moment, I have two options for churches:
1. The church where I went through the Encounter program, was Confirmed at in high school, attend during summer and breaks from college, and am registered at (individually, not as part of my family)
2. The church that I grew up in and where my parent are registered

The issue with number 1 is that while it’s my first choice, I’m hoping for a Friday wedding date to help cut reception costs (in Houston, a venue can be twice the cost on a Saturday which is a no-go for two recent college grads), but their website says they only do Saturday weddings at three different times. Unfortunately, since I don’t have an actual job, I don’t tithe, so I don’t feel like I have much pull when it comes to getting a weekday date.

The issue with number 2 is that it’s not close to any venues that I’m looking at (I’m trying to keep the drive from the church to the venue 40 minutes or less to be considerate for my guests), and honestly, it’s just kind of stuffy — they use a lot of incense, it’s dark (green, red, and blue), there’s not a lot of natural light, and I’ve passed out multiple times during regular mass there. My parents tithe, so between the pastor there being an ND grad and that, I probably have a better chance of getting a Friday, but there’s no guarantee.

I’ve also looked at other churches in the area, but the rates are way too out of budget for non-parishioners (in the $1500-4000 range), and I’ll already be paying $1000 for use of my number 1 church (total for use of building, organist, and cantor). I’d also feel weird getting married at a random church since we won’t be living in Houston or joining the community afterwards.

Additionally, since FH and I will be in Indiana from August-May, we were hoping to go through marriage prep with our campus ministry (it’s free for current students and we have the ability to meet in person). Both churches I’m looking at in Houston require in-person meetings that I just don’t think we’ll be able to accommodate (FH will be in Indianapolis this summer, and we’ll both be back at ND in the fall).

I’m at a loss and really struggling to figure out what to do. Having a Catholic wedding is very important to us, but not getting a Friday date would make it significantly more expensive (most, if not all, venues in the area include ceremony + reception in their fee and don’t decrease the fee if you don’t do the ceremony there, so I’m already getting double whammied for the cost of the ceremony — tacking on an extra $4-5k for a Saturday would just be way to difficult for us).

Any thoughts as to what we should do? At the moment I’m just a bit frustrated — you would think that if the Catholic Church really wanted people getting married in the Church, they’d make it a little easier!

More Details: His family is pitching in $10k, my family is pitching in $10k (or more if their compensation for a lawsuit is received before our wedding date), and we’re coving the rest. We also both have large families, so an intimate wedding would be difficult (although I would prefer it), but we’re trying not to go over 125-150 guests.",Catholicism
Tired of God playing games with my life/Why is God even telling me this? (Long read),AlyAnder4,1620231846,"A while ago, it was revealed that my uncle was gay. He was engaged for a long time, this discovery obviously crushing his fiancee. I felt incredibly sorry for he. Due to my OCD, I started obsessing over this and slowly started to develop a fear of becoming engaged to let alone marrying a gay man.

As soon as my fear had really developed, I started coming across recently published articles of celebrities coming out, videos of gay men coming out to their wives, even a TV show I regularly watched published a new episode where the wife came out as lesbian to her husband of 10 years. I thought this was a coincidence at first, that maybe I was just noticing things that were always there because I was fixated on this one particular topic. However these occurrences became much more frequent and specific as time went by.

At the time I was a loose catholic, I had new age beliefs and I often asked the universe for signs. A lot of the time I would feel the urge to ask for a sign out of the blue, due to my OCD and intrusive thoughts. I would say stuff like ""Show me this number 3 times in a row if my husband will be gay."" Boom. Done. ""Show me this rare bird if my husband will be gay."" Boom. A bird that I have never seen suddenly appears outside my window. ""Show me x,y,x,x,y,x in that exact order if my husband will be gay."" And so it was.

Even after being born again, these occurrences seem to be following me. I volunteer at a charity shop, and yesterday 3 customers came in after each other wearing all white. I jokingly thought to myself ""Please give us a customer who is not wearing white if my husband will not be gay."" A man NOT wearing white walks into the shop. Turns out, my manager knew him. ""Oh, hello Mr WHITE.""

All of these ""signs from God"" have been extremely fuzzy. I have never received anything clear, it's always something silly like the example I gave above. Not once have I received a dream from God, a sign from a saint, or come across a Bible verse specific to my situation, even after praying for confirmation from God.

I just don't understand why God is doing this to me. It has only caused me anxiety and dread. I've also contemplated suicide a few times because the thought of this really coming true is so humiliating and embarrassing. I have even gotten involved with new age practices, e.g tarot readings in order to receive some clarity/try to change my fate. In other words, it has only caused me pain and worsened my relationship with God.

I also think it's so unfair. In the Bible, whenever something God says that something bad will happen, he tells the prophets to warn the people and tells them how to change their ways in order to prevent said tragic event from happening. Meanwhile here God is just telling me that my marriage will be a lie.

This has been going on for years and tbh it's getting old. Why is God doing this to me? It feels as if he is playing games with my life and is laughing at me.",Catholicism
